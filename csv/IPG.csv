The state of transparency in ad tech has categorically improved over the last few years, with initiatives such as ads.txt and sellers.json providing a healthy step in the right direction. While much of the industry growth is due to those tools, they remain overwhelming and inaccessible to many. Sellers.guide is an automated tool that compares ads.txt files with sellers.json and provides simple and useful feedback to help publishers and buyers gain insights into who is really buying and selling inventory in any domain. “We’ve been a part of this industry for a long time. Long enough to feel that it is an integral part of who we are. Transparency is paramount for the success of our industry. And yet, the tools created to promote it are hard to grasp,” said Rotem Shaul, Co-CEO of Primis. “Our aim is to simplify, explain, elucidate, illuminate and help members of the ad industry navigate their way through the technological complexity on their journey to transparency.” Sellers.guide automatically cross-references ads.txt files with sellers.json files so that publishers can better understand how they can optimize their ads.txt files. Publishers can use Sellers.guide to recognize the obfuscation that exists behind those “DIRECT/RESELLER” labels - and avoid unauthorized reselling, domain spoofing, latency and revenue loss. A recent survey of publishers by Primis revealed there is a significant gap between reality and perception among many publishers. When asked How Many Sellers Currently Sell your Inventory? 56% of respondents said 2-13 and 25% said 14-34. Based on an examination of Ads.txt files those numbers do not reflect reality. “Most publishers have 90% more sellers than they realize,” continued Shaul. “The reason for this gap is that publishers are not properly maintaining their ads.txt file. When code is reviewed, they will find so many more sellers than they realized, including many resellers posing as direct sellers. Most publishers have no idea this is going on, and it’s a huge problem for the industry.” Today, publishers have widely adopted ads.txt to reduce the risk of counterfeit inventory and establish an honorable digital programmatic supply chain. The challenge today is that maintaining an ads.txt file is a manual and technically challenging process that most publishers don't fully understand. Despite the great adoption of ads.txt files, if they are not maintained, they can’t fulfill their mission and eventually further complicate the issue. Sellers.guide has four primary features: Analyze domain - A tool for publishers or potential buyers to search and get a complete analysis of specific domains. This analysis includes a transparency score, flags that point to common problems, and actionable insights on how to fix them. Also included is a complete list of the seller domains that have access to selling the inventory.Validate seller - Copy and paste ads.txt lines in bulk to analyze existing or potential vendors. This tool helps build trust between publishers and vendors, especially with new relationships.Industry highlights - Every week, Sellers.guide scans 116K domains and creates industry benchmarks so that every publisher can see how they are doing compared to the industry.Resources - Blogs, wikis and FAQs about ads.txt and sellers.json to make it more accessible and understandable. Sellers.guide was built to serve and improve all parties in the ad tech industry. The initiative is being offered free of charge and is open to collaboration from all members of the ad tech industry.

Our strong start to the year reflects the quality of our talent, across the organization, and underscores the successful evolution of our offerings at a time of accelerating, transformational change. Our ability to create marketing and media solutions that bring together outstanding creativity with the benefits of technology, and an ethical approach to data management, positions us to address higher-order business opportunities. This combination was a key driver of growth during Q1. Further, our return to growth coupled with the benefits of strategic restructuring actions taken last year, and certain variable expenses that remain at very low levels, led to outstanding margin performance this quarter.” “Supporting clients is a constant for us. We therefore remain focused on meeting their needs for integrated and collaborative teams that bring a range of expertise to bear to build brands and deliver business outcomes. Given that the pandemic is still with us, across the world, another top priority remains ensuring the health and well-being of our people. This includes a focus on equity and inclusion, as well as a long-term commitment across the ESG spectrum, including responsible data stewardship, digital media and brand safety practices.” “Building on a strong start to the year, and predicated on the assumption that there will continue to be a reasonably steady course of global economic recovery, we believe that we can deliver organic growth for the full year in the range of 5% to 6%. With that level of performance, we would expect to achieve 2021 adjusted EBITA margin of approximately 15.5%. As such, we look forward to creating further value and opportunity for all of our stakeholders.” Summary Revenue First quarter 2021 net revenue of $2.03 billion increased by 2.8% compared to $1.97 billion in the first quarter of 2020. During the quarter, our organic net revenue increase was 1.9%, which was comprised of a slight organic net revenue decrease of 0.2% in the U.S. and an increase of 6.3% internationally. First quarter 2021 total revenue, which includes billable expenses, was $2.26 billion, compared to $2.36 billion in 2020. Operating Results Operating income in the first quarter of 2021 was $243.0 million, compared to $75.9 million in 2020. Adjusted EBITA before restructuring charges was $265.9 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to adjusted EBITA of $97.2 million for the same period in 2020. Adjusted EBITA before restructuring charges margin on net revenue was 13.1%, compared to adjusted EBITA margin of 4.9% in 2020.Restructuring charges of $1.3 million consist of adjustments to the Company's restructuring actions taken during 2020; there were no new restructuring actions in 2021.Refer to reconciliations on page 9 for further detail. Net Results Income tax provision in the first quarter of 2021 was $23.8 million on income before income taxes of $116.4 million.First quarter 2021 net income available to IPG common stockholders was $91.7 million, resulting in earnings of $0.23 per basic and diluted share, compared to $0.01 per basic and diluted share for the same period in 2020. Adjusted earnings were $0.45 per diluted share, compared to adjusted earnings of $0.11 per diluted share a year ago. First quarter 2021 adjusted earnings excludes after-tax amortization of acquired intangibles of $17.4 million, after-tax restructuring charges of $1.0 million, an after-tax loss of $11.8 million on the sales of businesses and an after-tax loss of $55.5 million on the early extinguishment of debt.Refer to reconciliations on pages 8 through 10 for further detail. Operating Results RevenueNet revenue of $2.03 billion in the first quarter of 2021 increased 2.8% compared with the same period in 2020. During the quarter, the effect of foreign currency translation was positive 1.5%, the impact of net dispositions was negative 0.6%, and the resulting organic net revenue increase was 1.9%. Total revenue, which includes billable expenses, was $2.26 billion in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $2.36 billion in 2020. Operating ExpensesFor the first quarter of 2021, total operating expenses, excluding billable expenses, decreased by 5.9%, compared to the net revenue increase of 2.8% for the same period. Staff cost ratio, which is total salaries and related expenses as a percentage of net revenue, decreased to 68.7% in the first quarter of 2021 from 72.1% in the same period in 2020. Salaries and related expenses decreased 2.1% to $1.39 billion during the first quarter of 2021, compared to $1.42 billion for the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by reductions in base salaries, benefits and tax and severance expense, resulting from multiple initiatives taken in 2020 to align our expenses with changes in net revenue in response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic conditions. The decreases were partially offset by increased incentive expense, primarily related to better-than-projected performance, and increased temporary help expenses. Office and other direct expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue to 14.4% during the first quarter of 2021, compared to 19.2% a year ago. In the first quarter of 2021, office and other direct expenses were $292.9 million, a decrease of 22.6% compared to the same period in 2020, mainly driven by lower travel and entertainment expenses, bad debt expense, and new business and promotion expenses. The decrease in office and other direct expenses was also largely due to savings on occupancy expense as a result of our real estate restructuring actions taken in 2020. Selling, general and administrative expenses slightly increased as a percentage of net revenue to 1.4% during the first quarter of 2021, compared to 1.1% during the same period in 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, selling, general and administrative expenses were $28.2 million, an increase of 25.9% compared to the same period in 2020, primarily attributable to increases in professional fees and incentive expense, partially offset by decreased travel and entertainment expenses. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 3.4% during the first quarter of 2021, compared to 3.7% a year ago. During the first quarter of 2021, depreciation and amortization was $69.2 million, a decrease of 4.9% compared to the same period in 2020. Restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2021 were $1.3 million related to adjustments to our restructuring actions taken in 2020, which were designed to reduce our operating expenses structurally and permanently relative to revenue and to accelerate the transformation of our business. Non-Operating Results and TaxNet interest expense increased by $8.6 million to $42.7 million in the first quarter of 2021 from a year ago, primarily attributable to increased cash interest expense from the issuance of $650 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.750% unsecured senior notes due 2030 in March 2020 as well as a decrease in interest income. Other expense, net was $83.9 million in the first quarter of 2021, which included a pre-tax loss of $74.0 million related to the early extinguishment of debt. The income tax provision in the first quarter of 2021 was $23.8 million on income before income taxes of $116.4 million. This compares to an income tax provision of $17.2 million for the first quarter of 2020 on income before income taxes of $20.0 million. Balance SheetAt March 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.02 billion, compared to $2.51 billion at December 31, 2020 and $1.55 billion on March 31, 2020.

The program was designed to provide digital publishers, vendors, and business partners additional liquidity through faster payments and resolution of accounts within 15 days. ""We launched our Net15 effort during the pandemic to help support the industry and our partners who were navigating uncertain economic conditions,"" said Rotem Shaul, co-founder and co-CEO of Primis. ""While we are optimistic about the health of the sector and are seeing growth, we feel that it is our obligation to continue to support our partners and create a market with the best possible conditions.” Primis understands that payment terms throughout the industry are continually growing and according to Oarex, 60-day terms are now common. This puts considerable strain across all areas of the supply chain and publishers often waiting months for payment. “Even before the pandemic, payment terms within adtech were continually pushed out and it created a lot of financial strain for many publishers,” said Nicole Antonelli, Senior Marketing Manager at Horoscope.com, Inc. “We would like to applaud Primis for their commitment in offering payment terms of net 15 days and supporting their publisher partners.” ""We are hoping that others in the industry will follow our lead and improve payment terms,” continued Shaul.
