A queue has expanded to 47 vessels and 771 barges, with 430 of those heading north and the rest going south, Petty Officer Carlos Galarza of the Coast Guard’s 8th District said Thursday afternoon by email.The Mississippi River is the main artery for U.S. crop exports, with covered barges full of grain and soy floating to terminals along the Gulf of Mexico, while crude oil as well as imported steel also travel through sections of the waterway. Any sustained outage would disrupt shipments out of the Gulf. Corn futures tumbled by the most allowed under CME Group rules partly on speculation that exports would back up.“The river is the jugular for the export market in the Midwest for both corn and beans,” said Colin Hulse, a senior risk management consultant at StoneX in Kansas City. “The length of the blockage is important. If they cannot quickly get movement, then it is a big deal. If it slows or restricts movement for a longer period it can be a big deal as well.”The stoppage along the Mississippi River is the latest calamity to upend the commodities world in recent weeks. Back in March, the Suez Canal was blocked by a giant container ship that got stuck sideways in the vital waterway for almost a week, paralyzing global shipping. And late last week, a cyberattack brought down the largest fuel pipeline in the U.S. for five days, leading to widespread gasoline shortages from Florida to Virginia.A lengthy halt on the Mississippi River could further roil crop markets, where soybeans and corn futures have hit multiyear highs amid adverse weather in Latin America and a buying spree from China. Corn futures fell Thursday by the exchange limit of 40 cents, or 5.6%, to $6.7475 a bushel in Chicago.As a workaround, traders could in theory also send some supplies on trains and divert to ports along the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Few grain and soy buyers were bidding for barges north of the river closure amid uncertainty on when vessel traffic would resume.The crack halting vehicle and waterway traffic is in the truss of the Interstate 40 Hernando DeSoto Bridge, which was found during a routine inspection, according to a Tuesday statement from the Tennessee Department of Transportation.“The timeline is still undetermined” for the waterway reopening, department spokeswoman Nichole Lawrence said Thursday morning by email.The Army Corp of Engineers could figure out a way to keep automotive traffic closed in order for water traffic to resume under the bridge, according to CRU Group analyst Josh Spoores. It may cause bottlenecks, but most consumers already used to waiting months for supplies to ship are probably fine with some added delays, he said.The New Orleans Port Region moved 47% of waterborne agricultural exports in 2017, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The majority of these exports were bulk grains and bulk grain products, such as corn, soybeans, animal feed and rice. The region also supports a significant amount of edible oil exports, such as soybean and corn oils and even attracted 13% of U.S. waterborne frozen poultry exports in 2017.Some traders speculated that, based on past experience, the river might be partially opened for restricted movements while repairs are being done.“My sense is that it is not a big deal for river traffic as it will be a short-term disruption,” said Stephen Nicholson, a senior analyst for grains and oilseeds at Rabobank. “The good news is most of fertilizer has already come up river and soybean exports are at their low point. However, corn exports continue at a strong pace, so we may see a slight delay in corn barges reaching” New Orleans.It may be difficult for exporters to shift much volume to rail, as the capacity to unload trains outside of the New Orleans area is limited, according to Curt Strubhar, vice chairman and risk management consultant at Advance Trading Inc.“There aren’t many rail unloaders South of the issue,” he said, adding that New Orleans “port elevators aren’t equipped to handle a sharply higher share of rail unloads either.”Of agricultural supplies that floated on barges north of Memphis, about 84% was corn and about 13% was soybeans, according to Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition, citing USDA data. Overall shipments of corn and soy during the week ended May 8 were 18% higher than a year ago.Agricultural co-operative Growmark’s St. Louis port, which sends corn and soybeans south to New Orleans for export mostly to China and receives fertilizers, will likely close Friday, according to Matt Lurkins, executive director of the firm’s grain division.“Freight was already tight,” Lurkins said in a phone interview. “Then this kind of sent us over the edge.”If the pause drags on, he said, Growmark could send more grain to processors rather than loading it on barges for export.Small volumes of crude and partly refined oil are shipped by barge on the river as well. In February, 2.85 million barrels moved from the Midwest to the Gulf Coast via barge and tanker, according to government data.Imported steel on barges will be delayed as long as traffic is halted. About 25% of imported steel travels through at least a section of the Mississippi River, according to Wood Mackenzie analyst Cicero Machado, though he said newly arriving foreign steel to ports in New Orleans or Mobile, Alabama can be diverted onto rail cars or trucks.The river also is a major artery for steel shipments within the U.S. and delays could become an issue for automakers in the South that depend on high-strength steels produced in the Midwest, he said.“At this stage the big question is: is this going to last?” Machado said. “The issue is not actually in the river, it’s in a bridge over the river -- so perhaps they’re going to find a way to manage the traffic there.”(Adds Coast Guard update in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b0afe66f2082ea027310770c5d5006e1257799cfd3e125417d7bc4469cbd764c

company,1620657398,Why Ethereum Is On The Rise,67718164,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Iv8M8SECO0DEx9j9M3fJqg--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/Benzinga/ba05552148a91004f05777d4f6359859,CME,Yahoo,"The interest in Ethereum technology has never been higher. Ethereum is the second-largest public Blockchain network by both market capitalization and daily trading volume. It has already undergone remarkable development in its young history and continues to grow steadily. In 2020, an average of $231 million in ether was traded daily on spot exchanges. To start 2021, that number jumped to $2.7 billion. The interest has in part come from the acceleration of Decentralized Finance (Defi), a concept that focuses on blockchains and smart contracts rather than traditional financial intermediaries. It has also come from Ethereum layer 2 solutions – technology built on top of Ethereum that is highly scalable and efficient -- and sizeable developments with stablecoins, which are mostly anchored on the Ethereum network. As such, the excitement and interest around Ether shows signs of growing acceptance and an appreciation of decentralization. Let’s look at three key reasons for the growing interest in this rapidly changing market: Blockchain Technology To start, there is global adoption and growing interest in blockchain technology. According to a report from Deloitte, 40% of surveyed companies planned to spend at least $5 million on blockchain projects in 2020, and 86% of U.S. companies surveyed built or are in the process of building blockchain teams. 55% of those surveyed said Blockchain was a top five strategic priority. This acceptance and investment is a broad sign that blockchain technology has become more trusted among those looking to use it to improve business processes or use it as a method for transactions. Ethereum has emerged as the most established cryptocurrency for these purposes due to its DeFi and scalability credentials. In addition, 2020 ushered in improvements in crypto market structure, thanks to growing involvement from spot exchanges and custodian projects, as well as enhanced security and regulation to the spot crypto market. Institutional Interest Second, more institutions are warming up to the idea of crypto, which increases demand. In the current macro environment, some may view crypto as a hedge against potential future inflation. Looking to futures markets, institutional demand has certainly helped drive bitcoin markets recently. Average daily open interest in CME Group Bitcoin futures rose 233% in Q4 2020 over the same period in 2019. Additionally, the number of large open interest holders in Bitcoin futures rose to its highest level ever in December with 110 large traders holding more than 25 futures contracts (125 bitcoin equivalent). A Regulated Futures Market Lastly, institutions that include crypto in their portfolios need a trusted venue to manage risk with price transparency and liquidity. The launch of the CME Ether futures contract provides institutional investors a regulated market in which to get exposure to price movements without having to handle the digital asset, or deal with concerns about wallets, custodians, insurance or other barriers to entry. The Ether contract enables participants to invest in and access the cryptocurrency markets, while also managing any crypto-related risks. What's Next? The introduction of listed Ether futures will help to create a forward curve so Ethereum market participants can better manage price risk. In the days ahead, we may see traditional financial institutions such as major hedge funds and asset managers to enter the ether market along with funds that are crypto native. Further, the Ether futures contract will be useful to those hedging their digital exposure accumulated through transacting in the spot market, through mining or lending activities or from fundraising for a project. With ether demand growing, the futures contract performance will be something to watch in the months ahead. Whether viewed as a valuable blockchain technology or a store of value, Ethereum has carved out a large and important place in the market for crypto.

CME Group Ends In-Person Trade, Successfully Launches Micro Bitcoin Futures What Happened: Founded in 1848, CME Group is an exchange that builds markets around derivatives like futures, or agreements to buy and sell assets at a particular price and time in the future. The company has a long-standing history, offering global benchmark products based on interest rates, equity indices, foreign exchange, and commodities. In addition to building products, CME also facilitates and clears trades through its clearinghouse, CME Clearing. The organization’s move to end in-person trade for most products accelerated around 2015, after open outcry fell to just 1% of total volume. Now, only CME’s Eurodollar options pit will continue to operate. Takeaway: The move to end in-person trade comes as the pandemic accelerated the digital disruption in finance; by and large, market participants demand the efficiency, transparency, and prospects of growth electronic markets offer. Adding, CME, in meeting the demands of emerging market participants, recently launched Micro Bitcoin futures, which are 1/10 the size of one bitcoin and 1/50 the size of the standard CME Bitcoin future. The smaller size makes the product easier to consume by smaller participants. The product, thus far, has been well-received trading nearly 2.5 times as many contracts as the standard Bitcoin future, Tuesday.

TikTok Superstar Griffin Johnson Explains His Vision To Innovate And Inspire Influencer marketing, which is on track to become a $15 billion industry by 2022, is a unique way for creators to monetize their content and outreach. The problem with this industry is both the supply and demand dynamics, as well as an unfulfilling culture, according to some. More and more, creators are being faced with a tough decision, innovate or die. 22-year-old Illinois native Griffin Johnson has done just that. The media influencer, who recently made a pivot into angel investing and entrepreneurship, is not only looking to diversify his earnings but also spread increased value to his highly engaged audience, from his experiences networking with the likes of hedge fund manager Steve Cohen, Miami mayor Francis X. Suarez and others. In an exclusive interview, Benzinga chatted with Johnson to learn more about his pivot to investing and entrepreneurship, as well as his vision for the future and how he will continue to engage those followers that have been with him since the beginning.

The Group’s Eurodollar options pit, however, will continue to operate, as it has done since its reopening in August 2020. Furthermore, CME Group announced that subject to approvals, it will delist floor-based S&P 500 futures and options contracts once its contracts expire in September 2021. Post this delisting, the remaining open interest will be shifted to E-mini S&P 500 futures and options contracts. These contracts are available in electronic format on CME Globex. (See CME Group stock analysis on TipRanks) One day before it announced the closing of its trading pits, CME Group launched Micro Bitcoin futures, thereby increasing its crypto derivatives product offerings. CME Group Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Products Tim McCourt said, “At one-tenth the size of one bitcoin, Micro Bitcoin futures will provide an efficient, cost-effective way for a broad array of market participants- from institutions to sophisticated, active traders- to fine-tune their bitcoin exposure and enhance their trading strategies, all while retaining the benefits of CME Group’s standard Bitcoin futures.” On April 28, Raymond James analyst Patrick O’Shaughnessy reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and maintained a $218 price target (6.7% upside potential). Reacting to the company’s Q1 performance, O’Shaughnessy said, “While 1Q21 faced difficult year-on-year comp, trends were generally healthy as a rising rate environment jump-started rate volatility and CME’s interest rates franchise.” O’Shaughnessy believes “CME enjoys a very high barrier to entry business model, an attractive incremental margin profile, and upside to interest rates moving higher from here.” Consensus on the Street is that CME Group is a Moderate Buy based on 6 Buys, 6 Holds, and 2 Sells. The average analyst price target of $206.25 implies the stock is fairly priced at current level. Shares have gained about 18.4% over the past year.

Futures transactions had already been fully replaced by electronic trading, while options pits had been active until March 2020, when Covid-19 measures forced them to be closed.“I guess I am not surprised,” said Dan Huber, an independent broker who spent 31 years on the trading floor. “Sad to see it end this way but we will all turn the page and move on. It was a good run.”CME, one of the world’s largest derivatives exchange, had already closed floor trading for most futures contracts in Chicago and New York in 2015 as open outcry had fallen to just 1% of total volumes. The options pits in Chicago, with history stretching back 173 years, were the exchange’s last bastion for old-school commodities floor traders.The Eurodollar options pit will be the only one to continue to operate. CME also said it plans to delist its full-size, floor-based S&P 500 futures and options contracts following the expiration of the September 2021 contracts on Sept. 17.The 2009 documentary “Floored” captured the fading swagger of that world, where traders in brightly colored jackets shouting buy and sell orders could make or lose millions of dollars in a single day betting on everything from corn to pork bellies.Stories from the pits are legendary, with tales of hiring 6 foot 6 inch traders so they’d have a physical advantage. Some people put lifts in their shoes.News of the permanent shutdown came on the same day Chicago announced it aims to fully reopen by July 4.“Nice slap in the face for all of us that we’re hoping to return to the floor to pull our business and customer base back together,” said Huber. “I will likely stay involved in the business from the screen side, but it will never replace the days on the floor.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=eb6b39553648066eedef428d0ac26c0aaa0c442a933701be20da405717dd5411
