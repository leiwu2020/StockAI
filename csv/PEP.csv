The beat was driven by robust demand as more customers returned to restaurants and movie theatres as economies reopened. Shares of the snack and beverage giant gained 2.3% on July 13 to close at $152.96.



The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.72 per share, beating analysts’ expectations of $1.53 per share. Revenues of $19.22 billion exceeded the consensus estimate of $17.97 billion.



Notably, earnings per share jumped 27%, while net revenues grew 20.5% on a year-over-year basis. The company reported earnings of $1.32 per share in the prior-year period.



PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta commented, “Our results give us confidence that the investments behind our Faster, Stronger and Better framework are working - as we invest in our brands, supply chain and go-tomarket systems, manufacturing capacity, capabilities and culture, and our society by integrating purpose into everything we do. Moving forward, we remain focused on winning in the marketplace and building competitive advantages that will position us well as consumer habits and preferences evolve over time.”



CEO Laguarta also gave some insights during the conference call on higher costs due to inflation on some of its raw ingredients, labor, and freight charges. However, management remains confident that it will able to manage the increased costs through management initiatives, increased productivity, and likely higher prices post Labor Day.

PepsiCo Extends Restructuring Initiatives through 2026



PepsiCo announced its plans to extend the 2019 Productivity Plan until the end of 2026. Under the extended program, the company will work on various initiatives, like the implementation of newer technologies and the introduction of an automation program to its manufacturing and supply chain, to name a few.



Through the above initiatives, the company forecast annual productivity savings of more than $1 billion through 2026.



The extended plan will lead to higher pre-tax charges of $3.15 billion versus the prior forecast of $2.5 billion due to higher cash expenditures of $0.8 billion. So far, the company has incurred pre-tax charges of $874 million through June 12, 2021.



PepsiCo Raises 2021 Guidance



Based on robust Q2 results, management raised the financial guidance for FY2021. The company now forecasts adjusted earnings of $6.20 per share, while the consensus estimate is pegged at $6.09 per share.



Furthermore, core constant currency EPS growth is expected to be 11% versus the prior guidance of high-single-digit growth. The company now forecasts organic revenue growth of 6% versus mid-single-digit growth predicted earlier.



Following the robust Q2 results, Cowen & Co. analyst Vivien Azer increased the price target from $165 to $185 (21% upside potential) and reiterated a Buy rating on the stock.



Azer said, ""Strength was broad-based in the quarter, led by strong DD (double-digit) revenue growth for NAB (North American Beverages), coupled with meaningful margin expansion.”



Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 6 Buys and 5 Holds. The average PepsiCo price target of $161.40 implies 5.5% upside potential to current levels.



Pepsi scores a “Perfect 10” on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

Earnings Preview



The Earnings Whisper numbers for Q2 EPS and revenue are expected to be $1.52 and $17.91 billion, respectively.



For the full year 2021, the company has guided for a high-single-digit increase in adjusted EPS and mid-single-digit growth in organic revenue (non-GAAP measure).



Prior Period Results



In the first quarter, adjusted earnings stood at $1.21 per share, up 13% year-over-year, and outpaced analyst estimates of $1.12 per share.



Net Revenue climbed 6.8% to $14.82 billion and surpassed the Streets’ estimates of $14.55 billion. Organic revenue grew 2.4% year-over-year. 



In North America, the snacks business grew 3.7% year-over-year, while the beverages business increased 4.9%.



The combined snacks and beverages business across all the other regions increased 12% compared to the year-ago period. (See PepsiCo stock analysis on TipRanks)



Factors To Look For



Reaffirming the outlook for 2021, PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta said, “We remain fully committed to executing against our key set of priorities to become a Faster, Stronger, and Better organization and win in the marketplace. Following our first-quarter results, we have greater confidence in delivering on our financial guidance for the full year.”



The company is expected to report strong year-over-year results based on multiple factors including, the 2020 numbers being negatively impacted by the pandemic and economies across the globe slowly marching towards their pre-pandemic levels.



Furthermore, the large number of vaccines rolled out around the globe, together with the relaxation of government restrictions, will result in the opening of restaurants and bars, boosting the company’s revenue, specifically for beverages.



High inflationary conditions remained a challenge for the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry as commodity prices and packaging costs continued to compress margins. However, on the commodity side, the company states that its hedging programs are well-positioned to cover the risks.  



Moreover, for PepsiCo, a major factor for margin compression has been acquisition-related costs. Management expects these costs to continue to impact the Q2 results as well.



Recent Developments



As per a Reuters report, PepsiCo plans to reduce its sugar content in sodas and iced teas by 25% in the European Union, its second-largest market, by 2025, and reach a 50% cut by 2030.



The E.U. has levied taxes on sweetened drinks in an attempt to deal with obesity issues, thereby pressurizing beverage companies to reduce sugar levels.



The company aims to launch more nutritious snacks by 2025 in hopes of achieving a tenfold increase in sales by 2025 and reaching a $1 billion portfolio by 2030.



On June 24, PepsiCo’s Fritos joined hands with Papa Murphy’s Take 'n' Bake Pizza to launch its limited-edition Fritos® Outlaw Pizza, which will be available at Papa Murphy's locations until September.



Furthermore, on June 8, Frito-Lay announced a $200 million investment in Rosenberg, Texas, to add two manufacturing lines for Funyuns and tortilla chips. The project is expected to complete by 2023 and will create 160 jobs. The site will also ramp up its warehousing capabilities and increase future growth potential.



On May 28, PepsiCo announced an exclusive beverage partnership with FAT (Fresh. Authentic. Tasty.) Brands Inc., under which domestic FAT Brands restaurants will offer customers up to a dozen popular beverage choices from the diverse PepsiCo portfolio. The company’s beverage sales are expected to shoot up with the partnership.



In early May, PepsiCo launched soulboost, a sparkling water beverage with a splash of real juice and functional ingredients, L-theanine, and Panax ginseng. These ingredients help support mental stamina and relaxation and act as a healthy alternative to alcoholic beverages.



Soulboost further establishes PepsiCo as a leader in the enhanced water market, expected to reach $11.3 billion by 2027, according to Grandview Research, 2020.



Analyst Recommendations



On June 29, Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $165, which implies 10.8% upside potential to current levels. 



Mohsenian stated that the second-quarter earnings will be a positive catalyst for the stock. He expects the company to beat organic sales and earnings expectations and to raise its FY21 earnings guidance.



The analyst sees long-term growth prospects for the company, along with a positive near-term outlook.



Overall, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 4 Buys and 5 Holds. The average PepsiCo price target of $156 implies 4.8% upside potential to current levels.
