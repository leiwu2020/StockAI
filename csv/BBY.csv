(BBY) posted strong fiscal first-quarter 2022 results. Following the results, shares rose 1% on May 27 to close at $118.14. Adjusted earnings in Q1 grew substantially by 233% to $2.23 per share on a year-over-year basis and came in above the consensus estimate of $1.37 per share. Total sales of $11.64 billion climbed 35.9% from the year-ago period. Analysts were expecting revenues of $10.34 billion. Segment-wise, domestic revenue increased 37% year-over-year, while international revenues increased 23% from the year-ago period. Markedly, Enterprise comparable sales increased 37.2%. Best Buy CFO Matt Bilunas said, “The sales momentum is continuing into Q2 and we are raising our annual comparable sales growth outlook. As we think about the back half of this year, we expect shopping behavior will evolve as customers are able to spend more time on activities like eating out, traveling and other events. It is difficult to know exactly how that impacts our business, especially as we lap particularly strong sales in the back half of last year. Therefore, at this time, we are leaving our original FY22 back-half sales assumptions unchanged.” (See Best Buy stock analysis on TipRanks) Best Buy raised its guidance for full-year 2022. The company now expects enterprise comparable sales growth to be in the range of 3% to 6% versus its prior outlook of -2% to 1%. For the fiscal second quarter, the company expects enterprise comparable sales growth of approximately 17%. Following the fiscal Q1 earnings release, Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel assigned the stock a price target of $125 (5.8% upside potential) and a Hold rating. Nagel said, “Stronger-than-anticipated sales and earnings trends at BBY lately reflect clearly the company capitalizing well upon economic re-opening and an underlying healthy spending backdrop, bolstered by substantial government-funded stimulus.” The analyst added, “We continue to look very favorably upon BBY’s strategic positioning and will opportunistically look to turn more constructive toward shares as nearer-term concerns pass or are better priced into the equity.” The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

In fact, we seem to be on autopilot, with the S&P 500 just drifting horizontally. Now, let’s look at a few top stock trades heading into the holiday weekend. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: AMC Entertainment (AMC) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) gave bulls an absolutely gift going into the weekend. So much of a gift that perhaps they can even take Friday off and enjoy an extra long weekend. As I detailed a few days ago, AMC stock gave bulls a perfect pullback. The stock couldn’t push through the 61.8% retracement and pulled back to the April high and the 10-day moving average.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips After a sharp bounce, AMC stock rallied through resistance and exploded toward the January high near $20 on Wednesday. On Thursday, the top really blew off, with AMC surging 52% to the 161.8% extension before backing off a bit. This is a perfect area to book some or all profits. If shares continue higher, look for a move over $30. The two-times range extension is near $35 and the 261.8% extension is near $45. 7 Cheap Stocks With Dividends for Both Returns and Cash Flow On the downside, let’s see if it can hold $20 and/or the 10-day moving average as support. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Nvidia (NVDA) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is having a very quiet post-earnings reaction. Hovering near $620 now, we have to wait for a bit more direction with this one. On a dip, I’d love to see how Nvidia does on a test of the 10-day moving average on the four-hour chart. Below puts the 10-day moving average in play on the daily chart. If the sellers really step up, perhaps the 21-day moving average, $590 level and gap-fill are all in play. That would be a reasonable buy-the-dip spot after another strong quarter report. On the upside, keep an eye on this week’s high at $632.74. Above that puts the all-time high in play near $648.50, followed by the 161.8% near $668. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Best Buy (BBY) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) is also having a pretty quiet post-earnings reaction on Thursday. The stock was up earlier in the session, but has since faded from those highs. And BBY stock finished the day up just 1%. The stock continues to struggle with the $123 area. This has been resistance for several quarters now. That said, BBY stock continues to hold the 10-day, 21-day and 50-day moving averages on the downside. So support keeps coming into play, which is a good sign. 7 Best Media Stocks to Buy Now Amid The Big Merger Deals If support fails, look for a flush down to the 200-day moving average. This measure was support earlier in the month. If the stock clears $123 resistance, it puts the 52-week high in play near $128.50. Above that could put the two-times range extension on the table, near $133. Top Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Rocket Companies (RKT) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Don’t you love when a stock reacts to one of your previously drawn-in chart levels? That’s exactly what we had with Rocket Companies (NYSE:RKT) on Thursday. Shares erupted higher over the prior low at $17.50, as well as the 10-day moving average. For a moment, the stock even reclaimed the 21-day moving average. However, it ran right into prior support near $19.40 and was harshly rejected, falling about $1 per share. If it can clear this level, then that puts $20-plus in play. Specifically, it puts the 50-day moving average on the table, followed by the 200-day and the gap-fill mark at $22.67. On the downside, a break of $17.50 puts the low back in play at $16.22. On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in NVDA.

Amazon is planning to launch the service in Virginia and two other markets. Amazon’s present big item deliveries have disappointed customers due to their unassembled delivery status. The new service includes the item unpacking and assembling, packaging removal, and on-spot product return by the driver in case of a non-satisfaction, based on a Bloomberg reviewed presentation. Previously, customers had to schedule a different contractor to come to their home at an additional time to assemble the product. Drivers’ washing machine, dryer, and dishwasher installation training posed a threat to Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Best Buy’s similar services. The new offering was available in a limited number of cities. The service enabled customers to hire contractors through the website to assemble furniture or install ceiling fans and wall-mounted televisions. The service is intended to make delivery more inexpensive and easier for Amazon. Demand for bigger items like desks and office chairs had spiked during the pandemic from higher remote activities. Shoppers also became used to buying big-ticket items online. Online sales of furniture and housewares soared 41% in 2020 to $36.1 billion. Sales worth $37.3 billion were estimated in 2021. The demand spike for oversized items fueled delivery logjams and weeks-long delays, generating an opportunity for Amazon. Amazon has private-label furniture brands. The company launched the virtual reality shopping feature Showroom in 2019. Price action: W shares traded lower by 0.60% at $319.18 on the last check Friday.

The company currently offers scheduled delivery of big items -- like bunk beds and treadmills -- to a particular room in a shopper’s home. But customers are often disappointed when delivery people drop off the purchases unassembled in big boxes.Amazon declined to comment.Wayfair shares fell by almost 4% before recovering some of their losses. Amazon was mostly unchanged.The new service requires drivers to unpack and assemble the items, remove the packaging and take the item back on the spot if the customer isn’t satisfied, according to a presentation reviewed by Bloomberg. Previously, customers had to schedule a different contractor to come to their home at a different time to assemble the product, assuming the service was even offered in their location.A training video shows the delivery of a bed and mattress set, as well as a sofa and ottoman, which are fairly simple to assemble. Drivers could be trained to install appliances like washing machines, dryers and dishwashers, according to one of the people, posing a specific threat to Home Depot Inc., Lowe’s Cos Inc. and Best Buy Co., which also sell appliances with installation services.The new offering simplifies the existing Amazon Home Services, which is available in a limited number of cities and lets customers hire contractors through the website to assemble furniture or install ceiling fans and wall-mounted televisions. The new service is designed to make delivery more convenient, cheaper and easier for Amazon to manage, one of the people said.Drivers who hang out in online chat rooms are already balking at the new service. Concerns range from insufficient training to worries that Amazon will hold them to unreasonable job completion times. One driver in Virginia, who requested anonymity to avoid antagonizing his employer, said the company isn’t taking into account cluttered homes with narrow stairways, which can prolong how long it takes to make deliveries. Some colleagues fear catching Covid-19 because customers tend to hover over them when they drop off packages, he said.Demand for bigger items like desks and office chairs spiked during the pandemic as millions retreated to their homes. Shoppers also became more comfortable buying big-ticket items online that they previously preferred to purchase from a store where they can lie on beds or sit on sofas.Online sales of furniture and housewares jumped 41% in 2020 to $36.1 billion, according to Coresight Research. Sales are expected continue to grow this year, albeit more slowly, to $37.3 billion. The surge in demand for big items created delivery logjams and weeks-long delays, creating an opportunity for Amazon to bring its reputation for quick delivery to the sale of bigger items like furniture.The Seattle-based e-commerce giant has struggled to match the runaway success of Wayfair, which supplanted Amazon in 2019 as the biggest online home-goods retailer in the U.S., according to 1010Data. Amazon has its own private-label furniture brands and in 2019 launched the virtual reality shopping feature Showroom that lets shoppers see what furniture would look like at home.(Updated with company comment, drivers reaction.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e3848980eaeba0e82161b3e206ec282cde693941ce7afde10b1b1cee9950ae67

The program provides customers with widespread benefits including technical support, pricing that will be exclusive to members, two years of protection on most product purchases, free shipping and delivery, and free installation on most products and appliances. The Best Buy (BBY) Beta membership program will also provide access to a concierge service that will be available 24/7 by phone, email, chat or through the Best Buy app. Best Buy’s chief customer officer, Allison Peterson said, “As we look to evolve our membership programs, the goal of Best Buy Beta is to create a membership experience that customers will love and to leave them feeling confident throughout their relationship with Best Buy. This pilot offers premium service, complete with support aimed at anticipating our customers’ needs.” Currently, the new membership program is available in select stores in Iowa, Oklahoma, and eastern Pennsylvania. The company intends to expand Best Buy Beta to about 60 stores by taking it to stores in Minnesota, North Carolina, and Tennessee this month. (See Best Buy stock analysis on TipRanks) Last month, Loop Capital Markets analyst Anthony Chukumba reiterated a Buy rating and a price target of $150 on the stock. Chukumba said that Best Buy could stand to benefit from the liquidation of electronic appliances retailer, Fry’s Electronics, and is positioned to benefit from electronics and appliances sales, while further solidifying its “importance and leverage” over its suppliers. The rest of the Wall Street community is sidelined on the stock with a Hold consensus rating. That is based on 5 analysts suggesting a Buy, 7 analysts recommending a Hold and 2 analysts suggesting a Sell. The average analyst price target of $117.46 implies around 2.6% downside potential to current levels. BBY scores a 6 out of 10 according to the TipRanks Smart Score system, indicating that the stock is likely to perform in line with market averages.
