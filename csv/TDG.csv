However, both top and bottom-line numbers declined year-over-year due to the negative impact stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. The aerospace manufacturing company’s net sales of $1.19 billion surpassed the Street’s estimates of $1.17 billion but declined 17.3% from the year-ago period. Earnings decreased 49.4% to $2.58 per share, beating the consensus estimates of $2.51 per share. Additionally, EBITDA for the period decreased 23.1% year-over-year to $519 million. TransDigm Group CEO Kevin Stein said, “The commercial aerospace industry has continued to show signs of recovery in recent months with the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine and increasing air traffic, especially in certain domestic markets. We also saw another quarter of strong sequential improvement in our commercial bookings. These trends are encouraging and although the pace of the recovery is uncertain, we remain ready to meet the demand as it returns.” (See TransDigm Corp stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the fiscal 2Q earnings release, Cowen & Co. analyst Gautam Khanna maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $256. Khanna said, “March Q aero aftermarket demand inflected higher, & mgmt still expects June/Sept aftermarket demand to exceed H1’s, a mix plus. TDG’s stock remains our top aero aftermarket recovery play.” The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 2 Buys versus 1 Hold. The average analyst price target of $663.33 implies 10.5% upside potential to current levels. Shares have increased 7.8% over the past six months. TipRanks’ Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool shows that confidence in TransDigm is currently Neutral, as 12 hedge funds decreased their cumulative holdings of the stock by 775,600 shares in the last quarter.

company,1612797859,Preview: TransDigm Gr's Earnings,66372756,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,TDG,Yahoo,"On Tuesday, February 09, TransDigm Gr (NYSE:TDG) will release its latest earnings report. Here is Benzinga's outlook for the company. What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue Sell-side analysts expect TransDigm Gr's EPS to be near $2.02 on sales of $1.12 billion. TransDigm Gr reported a profit of $4.93 per share when it published results during the same quarter last year. Sales in that period totaled $1.47 billion. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates""; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise"", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. View more earnings on TDG If the company were to report earnings in line when it publishes results Tuesday, quarterly profit would be down 59.03%. Sales would be down 23.55% from the same quarter last year. Here is how the company's reported EPS has compared to analyst estimates in the past: Quarter Q4 2020 Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 EPS Estimate 1.98 0.94 4.36 4.64 EPS Actual 2.89 1.54 5.10 4.93 Revenue Estimate 1.10 B 1.01 B 1.45 B 1.45 B Revenue Actual 1.17 B 1.02 B 1.44 B 1.47 B Stock Performance Shares of TransDigm Gr were trading at $605.01 as of February 05. Over the last 52-week period, shares are down 6.72%. Given that these returns are generally negative, long-term shareholders are likely unhappy going into this earnings release. Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call. TransDigm Gr is scheduled to hold the call at 11:00:00 ET and can be accessed here.
