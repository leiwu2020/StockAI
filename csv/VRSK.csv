But obtaining all that information can be a significant challenge. To help address this need, Verisk (Nasdaq: VRSK), a leading global data analytics provider, has launched Roof Underwriting Reports, combining artificial intelligence and leading analytics to provide insurers with robust views of every roof they insure. “A roof is one of the most important parts of a structure to consider during underwriting and one of the most difficult on which to obtain updated information due to the hidden and evolving risk,” said Neil Spector, president of ISO at Verisk. “Our new Roof Underwriting Reports can help insurers quickly gain insights to refine risk selection and segmentation, automate underwriting and better serve their customers.” Growing roof claims highlight need for enhanced underwriting analytics The new Roof Underwriting Reports are being introduced as many insurers are seeing the number of damaged roofs in the United States continue to grow. More than 2.3 million roof claims were processed in 2020 by Xactware, a Verisk business. That was about a 25 percent increase in the number of roof claims compared to 2019. The new Roof Underwriting Reports draw on a wide range of robust and unique data, providing insights into several factors insurers may consider during underwriting, including: Age and condition — While many insurers traditionally rely on in-person inspections or the year of construction—that data may be difficult to obtain and imprecise. Verisk combines aerial imagery analytics, permits data, and an array of other data elements to provide updated information on the age, material, geometry and changing conditions of a roof.Replacement costs — As they have over the last year, the costs of materials and labor can vary widely over time and in different areas. Verisk draws on updated pricing surveys and actual claims to deliver reliable replacement cost estimates for roofs, down to their individual components.Hail and wind damage — Hail damage can go unnoticed for years, and a claim may be filed with an insurer who wasn’t covering the building when the damage occurred. Verisk’s imagery and weather data enable insurers to identify roofs that have been affected by past storms. The Roof Underwriting Report for Homeowners also features information on tree coverage, advisory loss costs and claims insights on neighboring residences.

Verisk (Nasdaq:VRSK) is a leading global provider of predictive analytics and decision-support solutions. The new SmartScopeTM feature in Xactimate, powered by VaiTM, rapidly guides property professionals through the estimating and repair process for water mitigation, interior and exterior claims. Estimators simply answer dynamic questionnaires, apply line items, select property characteristics and then SmartScope automatically calculates repair costs. Water mitigation technicians can create floor plan diagrams, manage equipment placement and enter moisture readings from Xactimate mobile. Xactimate and XactAnalysis are powerful claims-estimating and claims management solutions developed by Verisk’s Xactware business. SmartScope is part of the next generation of InsurTech powered by Verisk artificial intelligence and automation, or Vai. “Verisk and Xactware remain committed to helping property professionals shorten workflows with higher-quality and more efficient outcomes,” said Xactware President Mike Fulton. “We couldn’t be more pleased to introduce this new set of tools to greatly enhance efficiency, speed, quality and consistency throughout the estimating and claims management process. Further, the SmartScope toolset is included at no additional cost with each Xactimate Pro license, requiring no additional software to download or install, nor additional transaction fees for the use of SmartScope.” SmartScope enables property professionals to work directly from within Xactimate’s Sketch tool — using digital diagrams either imported from third-party services or manually created — to answer questions in dynamic forms that are auto-generated for each applicable job type. SmartScope then applies the appropriate quantity of line items and fully audits and scores the estimate based on building techniques and general scoping practices, such as the IICRC’s S500 standards for water mitigation or a company’s specific scoping rules. Estimators can even create, measure and score custom drying plans for water mitigation losses. Xactware customers excited by SmartScope benefits“SmartScope is the first tool on the market to be able to help our franchises capture and guide them through a better scope and audit as they are doing the job,” ServPro Chief Information Officer Jeff Fields said. “It also benefits our insurance clients and our customers by providing a more accurate scope and allows us to adjust the scope while the job is in progress.” American Technologies, Inc. President Jeff Moore also sees benefits for estimators, clients and insurance companies: “SmartScope provides ATI with assurance in knowing we will continually exceed customer expectations while better managing the business through the creation of consistent, accurate and quality estimates for various job scenarios. SmartScope will also benefit the industry as a whole, by reducing the complexity and errors of an ever-increasingly rule-driven industry.” SmartScope will be available with the latest version of Xactimate Pro starting June 29 to profiles with the feature flag enabled. SmartScope is available with the latest version of Xactimate Pro. To learn more about this new feature, watch the “A New Approach to Water Mitigation” session at VeriskElevate.com.

Private U.S. property/casualty insurers’ net income after taxes fell 2.9% to $60.1 billion in 2020 from $61.9 billion in 2019. Insurers’ rate of return on average policyholders’ surplus, a measure of overall profitability, declined to 6.8% from 7.8% in 2019. Insurers provided roughly $11.5 billion in premium relief to policyholders despite reporting a 5.6% decline in net investment income caused by the lowest investment yield since at least 1960. Insurers’ combined ratio, which measures underwriting performance, did improve somewhat to 98.7% in 2020 from 98.9% in 2019 and insurers’ net underwriting gain increased to $5.1 billion from $3.7 billion in 2019. “Insurers’ net income and net written premium growth declined in 2020 as the industry was hit by the pandemic and severe natural catastrophe losses,” said Robert Gordon, APCIA senior vice president, policy, research and international. “Investment yields fell to the lowest level since at least 1960. Insurers eked out a $5.1 billion underwriting gain on more than $650 billion of NWP after reserve releases, although that gain may not reflect the potential of significant long-tail losses from COVID-19. The drop in personal lines combined ratio is reflective of the drop in the personal auto combined ratio which is largely due to a temporary reduction in miles driven. While personal auto writers provided various forms of rebate and significant rate reduction, severity of claims continued to climb significantly, and miles driven has been rapidly increasing in 2021.” “During a challenging year, many insurers accelerated their digital transformations and used new technology, like our OneXperience virtual inspection platform, to continue serving their customers,” said Neil Spector, president of ISO, a Verisk business. “Now, at a moment of great uncertainty—about the continued course of the pandemic, the potential for future climate-driven catastrophes, and the contours of our emerging ‘new normal’—it’s critical for insurers to further enhance their operational efficiencies and sharpen the use of data-driven insights as they reset from 2020.” Taking the measure of COVID-19 and catastrophes on the industry The pandemic’s impact was acutely felt in the broader economy and as economic activity slowed, growth in both premiums and losses followed suit. Insurers wrote $650.4 billion in net premiums in 2020, an increase of just 2.6% from $634 billion in 2019, in contrast to the 6.2% growth rate reported for the first quarter of 2020. Net earned premium also grew 2.6% for the year. The year 2020, marked by 19 catastrophes with at least $1 billion in direct insured losses in the United States (according to Verisk PCS), generated $61.7 billion in net insured losses and loss adjustment expenses (LLAE) from catastrophes, more than double the 2019 amount. However, overall LLAE growth slowed in 2020 to 1.2%, down from 4.3% in 2019, thanks to a $27.9 billion decline in LLAE for losses other than catastrophes. Many personal lines insurers offered substantial premium relief to auto policyholders in 2020. According to an analysis from ISO, insurers issued roughly $11.5 billion in premium relief to policyholders in 2020 through a combination of dedicated rate reductions at renewals, premium credits, and policyholder dividends. Partly as a result, net written premium growth for insurers writing mostly personal lines slowed to 0.4% in 2020 from 4.5% a year earlier. Personal lines insurers’ combined ratio improved 2.2 percentage points to 95.6%. Policyholders’ surplus rose to $910.2 billion as of December 31, 2020, from $847.3 billion as of December 31, 2019, driven by growth in the stock market.

The so-called Class of 2020 is a group of insurance, reinsurance and specialty companies formed in 2020, including Conduit Re, Core Specialty, Inigo Ltd, Integral ILS Ltd, and Vantage Risk. AIR Worldwide is a Verisk (Nasdaq:VRSK) business. “As a pure play global reinsurance business with an ambition to write a profitable and well-diversified book of business, it was important for us to find a modeler who understood our needs and was able to offer sophisticated yet easy to use solutions to help manage our growing reinsurance portfolio,” said Trevor Carvey, CEO of Conduit Re. “With this in mind, we selected AIR because of their commitment to providing the best in class catastrophe models coupled with cutting edge software technology, which was easily integrated into our underwriting platform and workflow.” “As a new insurer focused on the Lloyd’s market, we determined very quickly that AIR’s models and software were able to provide solutions for all of our key specialty lines, including reinsurance and property insurance, and also provide in short order a valuable portfolio roll-up capability,” said Russell Merrett, CUO of Inigo Ltd. “Vantage Risk’s initial launch has been very successful in Reinsurance. AIR’s Touchstone platform gives us the ability to speedily and quantitatively assess the opportunities presented to us, and to distinguish ourselves already as a new entrant in the catastrophe market,” states Chris McKeown, Chief Executive of Reinsurance and ILS for Vantage Group. “We’re extremely proud to have so many innovative insurance companies from the class of 2020 select AIR over other solutions and rely on AIR model results as their preferred view of risk,” said Milan Simic, executive vice president and head of Global Business Development, Verisk Insurance. “Coupled with our unique technology and expertise, our strong determination to help customers flourish make Verisk a great innovator in this exciting phase of the growth of the global (re)insurance market.” Additionally, many insurance, reinsurance and specialty companies outside the Class of 2020 continue to select AIR as its modeler of choice and switch from other solutions available in the market. One such company is Quantedge Capital. “As an alternative investment asset manager with specific needs for managing catastrophe risk, we were glad that AIR have been able to combine a collaborative approach to doing business with superior catastrophe models and a software platform that is ideally suited for helping manage our portfolio,” said G Ping Lee, Analyst, Quantedge Capital. “We’re thrilled to see such a varied group of (re)insurance companies select AIR as their preferred modelling firm,” said Rob Newbold, executive vice president, AIR Worldwide. “It seems that one thing that pure play reinsurers, Lloyds-focused insurers, and alternative asset managers across the world have in common is that they all trust AIR to provide model results that can be reliably used as the main view of risk, and a software platform that meets the increasing needs for performance, transparency and flexibility.” AIR provides risk modeling solutions to the global insurance industry and to-date 16 of the top 20 non-life reinsurers; 8 of the top 10 global non-life insurers; 8 of the top 10 Lloyd’s syndicates; and all of the top 5 global reinsurance brokers work with AIR.

JERSEY CITY, N.J., May 18, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- More than 4.5 million U.S. properties are at a high-to-extreme risk of wildfire, with more than 2 million of those in California alone, according to estimates from Verisk, (Nasdaq:VRSK), a leading global data analytics provider. To help promote the importance of building resilient communities to property insurers and their customers, the National Fire Protection Association is providing Verisk with robust data on communities engaging in wildfire mitigation efforts. Verisk will leverage the data from the NFPA Firewise USA® recognition program to develop property-level analytics insurers can use to refine their underwriting. This collaboration will help NFPA by promoting the value of community-wide wildfire risk reduction activities to a broader public. “The record-breaking wildfire seasons in recent years has underscored the devastation these catastrophes can cause. Communities can take steps to protect properties and the surrounding neighborhood, including educating property owners and encouraging them to take wildfire risk reduction steps,” said Jim Pauley, president and CEO of the NFPA. “By sharing the data on these efforts with Verisk, we’ll be able to further promote the need for community and individual action to reduce risk.” “Our collaboration with the NFPA will not only enable insurers to assess wildfire risk mitigation efforts but will also help communities recognize the growing importance of resilience,” said Doug Caccese, president of ISO Personal Lines at Verisk. “We’ll be able to strengthen efforts to protect people and property from the dangers of wildfire and be a leading provider of mitigation data to the insurance industry.” The national Firewise USA recognition program is administered by NFPA and is co-sponsored by the USDA Forest Service and the National Association of State Foresters. It provides a voluntary, collaborative framework to help neighbors in a geographic area get organized, find direction, and take action to increase the ignition resistance of their homes and community to reduce wildfire risks at the local level. Public education about wildfire safety is also one part of Outthink Wildfire™, an NFPA policy initiative, which calls on all levels of government to make significant policy changes to create safer homes and businesses through home upgrades and risk reduction, sound building and land use standards, and increased resources for managing wildland fuels. Verisk has developed a full suite of solutions that can help insurers and communities assess wildfire risk.

To help address this challenge, Verisk (Nasdaq: VRSK), a leading global data analytics provider, today launched Cyber Risk Navigator, a next-generation cyber risk modeling and aggregation platform built to help insurers, reinsurers and brokers understand the financial impact of cyber incidents. The new SaaS platform features a comprehensive suite of models to estimate potential insured cyber losses for individual incidents and thousands of aggregation scenarios. It includes both systemic and targeted ransomware models and several innovations that provide efficient workflows, and an enhanced robust financial model that more accurately incorporates insurance terms specific to cyber. Cyber Risk Navigator reveals critical insights and empowers users to: Measure and monitor aggregations of cyber risk within a portfolio Enable risk modeling and data augmentation to manage and develop a custom view of risk Understand and adjust risk selection guidelines based on analytics output from robust models Develop full stochastic and historical scenario catalogs to facilitate a robust view of tail risk Leverage flexible financial modeling to support a wide range of affirmative cyber coverages and determine potential losses Analyze a breadth of loss breakdowns across diverse event vectors and coverages ""2020 has brought another set of lessons for us in the cyber insurance industry. Cyber risk is growing and intensifying, forcing insurers to reconsider how they manage their cyber portfolios,"" said Prashant Pai, general manager, Verisk Cyber Solutions. ""Cyber Risk Navigator is a state-of-the-art solution created to help insurers address this challenge and improve pricing and risk selection."" Underlying the models is the Cyber Industry Exposure Database, featuring more than 100 million organizations worldwide, filling in gaps of exposure information using firmographics like revenue and employee count, and business and security data such as cloud service providers. With the platform, users can view losses across their portfolio for any service provider and determine which causes of cloud failure drive these losses. ""The new targeted ransomware model and inclusion of a proprietary set of technographic data are two of the most innovative modeling features of Cyber Risk Navigator,"" said Scott Stransky, vice president and director of cyber modeling for Verisk. ""Losses from ransomware have driven cyber insurance claims for the past two years. We built a model that captures these events and includes the potential for them to correlate across portfolios.” Cyber Risk Navigator uses proprietary, raw internet sensor data to develop Verisk’s own transparent cyber hygiene scores. The platform is trained with a gradient boosting machine learning model and calibrated against actual cyber insurance claims. The raw sensor data has also enhanced Verisk’s service provider failure models, which now go beyond the cloud to include content delivery network and email outages. The sensor data can help capture not just whether an insured relies upon a service but also quantify the volume of traffic flowing between the company and that service. ""The number of cyber incidents is growing, and the causes of these cases are constantly evolving, making the demand for cyber insurance greater than ever,"" concluded Pai. ""Understanding what drives cyber risk is an important start for insurers, but they need tools to make better risk management decisions and stay ahead of the ever-changing threats. We designed Cyber Risk Navigator to enable insurers to confidently grow their portfolios in an ultra-competitive, dynamic market."" Cyber Risk Navigator is a part of Verisk's Cyber Solutions Suite, an end-to-end ecosystem that can help insurers and reinsurers more quickly deliver new cyber programs or enhance existing solutions. Powered by data on more than 100 million organizations worldwide, the suite provides a wide range of products and services, including a pricing, underwriting, and distribution platform; advisory policy language and loss costs; applicant analytics and scoring solution; a portfolio visualization engine; and aggregation management modeling for cyber risk.

JERSEY CITY, N.J., May 12, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Obtaining life insurance could soon become quicker and easier with the launch of an automated solution from Verisk (Nasdaq:VRSK), a leading global data analytics provider. Verisk’s new EHR Triage Engine Plus leverages natural language processing and artificial intelligence to distill critical insights from medical notes in lengthy, consumer-authorized, electronic health records (EHRs). The EHR Triage Engine Plus is the latest version of the groundbreaking EHR Triage Engine, which was launched last year. Both solutions can quickly analyze information-rich, electronic health records that can be thousands of pages long and deliver an easy-to-read, 1- to 2-page summary of key risk elements along with a recommended underwriting classification. “Life insurance underwriters can spend a huge amount of time sifting through electronic health records. And many key risk elements needed for underwriting, such as cancer stage, can only be found within an EHR’s medical notes,” said Maroun Mourad, president of global underwriting at Verisk. “Our new solution brings automation and advanced analytics to this difficult and time-consuming process, helping insurers accelerate accurate underwriting and the buying experience for consumers.” These solutions were developed with extensive feedback from SCOR, a leading reinsurer and early adopter of the EHR Triage Engine technology. “The value of Electronic Health Records has long been difficult to obtain, because of the challenge in normalizing and processing critical data presented in a wide range of formats,” said J.C. Brueckner, CEO of SCOR Global Life Americas Reinsurance Company. “Verisk’s new solutions is another competitive advantage that helps us enable carriers to use this information to make faster, informed underwriting decisions without sacrificing accuracy. That means better business outcomes and a superior customer experience.” The Verisk solution can be integrated with insurers’ existing underwriting systems, delivered via a stand-alone API, or integrated into technology from FAST, a Verisk business and leading provider of end-to-end software for the life and annuity markets.

These revenues increased 4.9% on an OCC basis in the first quarter of 2021. Of the remaining 15%, we have identified specific solutions and services, largely transactional in nature, that are being negatively impacted by COVID-19. These revenues declined approximately 5.9% on an OCC basis in first-quarter 2021 compared to the prior-year period.

These increases were partially offset by a decrease in certain transactional revenues. •Claims revenues grew 9.0% in the quarter and 7.9% on an OCC basis. Growth was primarily driven by our repair cost estimating solutions revenue. Energy and Specialized Markets segment revenue increased 1.3% in the quarter and declined 0.6% on an OCC basis. Growth in core research and environmental health and safety service revenues was offset by declines in transactional and consulting revenues. Financial Services segment revenue decreased 15.0% in the quarter and 12.8% on an OCC basis, primarily due to certain contract transitions, projects that did not reoccur and lower levels of consulting spending from our bank customers stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Net Income and Adjusted EBITDADuring first-quarter 2021, net income attributable to Verisk declined 1.8%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8.7%, and 5.2% on an OCC basis.

Diluted adjusted EPS increased 5.1% to $1.23 for the first quarter of 2021, reflecting cost discipline in the business, a reduction in travel expenses as a result of COVID-19, and a lower average share count. Cash FlowNet cash provided by operating activities was $448.7 million for the first quarter of 2021, up 23.7%. Capital expenditures were $59.2 million for the first quarter, up 11.9%. Free cash flow was $389.5 million, up 25.8%, primarily due to an increase in cash collections from customers and a reduction in travel payments as a result of COVID-19. Free cash flow represented 112.7% of adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter, compared with 97.4% in the prior-year period. DividendOn March 31, 2021, we paid a cash dividend of 29 cents per share of common stock issued and outstanding to the holders of record as of March 15, 2021. On April 28, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of 29 cents per share of common stock issued and outstanding, payable on June 30, 2021, to holders of record as of June 15, 2021. Share RepurchasesIncluding the accelerated share repurchase (ASR) settled in the first quarter of 2021, we repurchased approximately 561 thousand shares at an average price of $178.40, for a total cost of $100.0 million for the first quarter of 2021. On March 31, 2021, we had $478.8 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization.

These statements relate to future events or to future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. This includes, but is not limited to, our expectation and ability to pay a cash dividend on our common stock in the future, subject to the determination by our Board of Directors and based on an evaluation of our earnings, financial condition and requirements, business conditions, capital allocation determinations, and other factors, risks, and uncertainties. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “may,” “could,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “target,” “seek,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that are, in some cases, beyond our control and that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Other factors that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements can be found in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, annual reports on Form 10-K, and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from what we projected. Any forward-looking statement in this release reflects our current views with respect to future events and is subject to these and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions relating to our operations, results of operations, growth strategy, and liquidity. We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Notes Regarding the Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe have provided certain non-GAAP financial information as supplemental information regarding our operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. We believe that our presentation of non-GAAP measures provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our management uses these measures for reviewing our financial results, for budgeting and planning purposes, and for evaluating the performance of senior management. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Expenses: EBITDA represents GAAP net income adjusted for (i) depreciation and amortization of fixed assets; (ii) amortization of intangible assets; (iii) interest expense; and (iv) provision for income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for acquisition-related costs (earn-outs), gain/loss from dispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), and nonrecurring gain/loss. Adjusted EBITDA expenses represent adjusted EBITDA net of revenues. We believe these measures are useful and meaningful because they allow for greater transparency regarding our operating performance and facilitate period-to-period comparison. Adjusted Net Income and Diluted Adjusted EPS: Adjusted net income represents GAAP net income adjusted for (i) amortization of intangible assets, net of tax; (ii) acquisition-related costs (earn-outs), net of tax; (iii) gain/loss from dispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), net of tax; and (iv) nonrecurring gain/loss, net of tax. Diluted adjusted EPS represents adjusted net income divided by weighted-average diluted shares. We believe these measures are useful and meaningful because they allow evaluation of the after-tax profitability of our results excluding the after-tax effect of acquisition-related costs and nonrecurring items. Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP minus payments for capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow is an important measure of the recurring cash generated by our operations that may be available to repay debt obligations, repurchase our stock, invest in future growth through new business development activities, or make acquisitions. Organic Constant Currency (OCC): Our operating results, such as, but not limited to, revenue and adjusted EBITDA, reported in U.S. dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying foreign currencies in which we transact changes in value over time compared with the U.S. dollar; accordingly, we present certain constant currency financial information to assess how we performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We calculate constant currency by translating comparable prior-year-period results at the currency exchange rates used in the current period. We define “organic” as operating results excluding the effect of recent acquisitions and dispositions (which include businesses held for sale) that have occurred over the past year. An acquisition is included as organic at the beginning of the calendar quarter that occurs subsequent to the one-year anniversary of the acquisition date. Once an acquisition is included in its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also included to calculate organic growth. A disposition (which includes a business held for sale) is excluded from organic at the beginning of the calendar quarter in which the disposition occurs (or when a business meets the held-for-sale criteria under U.S. GAAP). Once a disposition is excluded from its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also excluded to calculate organic growth. The organic presentation enables investors to assess the growth of the business without the impact of recent acquisitions for which there is no prior-year comparison. A disposition’s results are removed from all prior periods presented to allow for comparability. We believe organic constant currency is a useful and meaningful measure to enhance investors’ understanding of the continuing operating performance of our business and to facilitate the comparison of period-to-period performance because it excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate movements, acquisitions, and dispositions.

See page 11 for a reconciliation of segment adjusted EBITDA margin, a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA expenses, and a reconciliation of diluted adjusted EPS.

Using climates projected by four climate models as inputs, simulated yields across the Corn Belt during the decade 2046–2055 were 20–40% less than yields simulated during the 1991–2000 decade due to impact of climate change on weather, according to a new report. In addition to the reduction in average yield during the 2046-2055 simulation decade, the year-to-year variation in yield increased significantly with climate change, reflecting a reduction in stability of yield and an associated increase in the risk of catastrophic crop losses. In collaboration with Verisk (Nasdaq:VRSK), a leading global data analytics provider, David Victor, who at the Brookings Institution has done in-depth research on how the physical impacts of climate change may affect US financial markets, and experts from AXIS Capital, explored how climate change may affect agricultural risk in the United States, specifically looking at the impact on corn yield. “There is justified concern about effects of recent and future climate changes on agriculture both in the United States and across the globe,” said Dr. Peter Sousounis, vice president and director of climate change research, AIR Worldwide. “If, or when, climate change brings with it more frequent and/or more extreme unfavorable weather to areas of significant crop production, such as the midwestern United States, the potential for significant crop losses and economic impacts could be heightened. The purpose of this study is to further explore these possibilities for future, more extreme climate changes involving more frequent and more damaging events reducing productivity of major crops.” Verisk’s extreme event modeling business unit, AIR Worldwide (AIR), conducted the research to isolate effects of variation in weather and climate on corn yield. To better understand and quantify the potential magnitude of climate change impacts on crops, an AIR process-based Crop Growth and Yield Model was used to simulate effects of observed past and projected future climate changes on corn yield at high resolution throughout the U.S. Corn Belt, defined as the states: Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Corn was chosen as the study focus because it is the most valuable crop grown in the United States and because the United States is the world’s largest producer of corn. Many of the lessons learned from this study are pertinent to other major crops grown domestically and abroad. Victor leads the “Markets at Risk” project at Brookings, and in that capacity collaborated extensively with AIR. “Given how much the industry relies on corn production, it’s important to understand its vulnerabilities to the effects of climate change. Moreover, learnings from this research can be applied to the agriculture industry as a whole since any disruptions in this sector are likely to affect other global supply chains – from food and beverage to the production of fibers like cotton,” said Bob Quane, Chief Underwriting Officer AXIS Insurance. “As insurers and reinsurers, we have a critical role in understanding and mitigating risks posed by climate change. This research, conducted in collaboration with AIR Worldwide and scholars from Brookings, is vital as we continue to navigate our changing world.” When the AIR crop model was used to rigorously simulate effects of observed, historical weather during the period 1974–2019 on corn yield, it was found that climate trends during that period favored increased corn yield over much of the Corn Belt. Climate trends simulated over the period 1991 to 2055 by four climate models caused increased weather stresses and reduced corn yield. This implies, that without mitigation of negative effects of climate change, including adaptation by farmers and improvements to crop genetics and other technological factors, corn yield and production may be negatively impacted in the next few decades. As a result, communities economically dependent on crop production may face financial challenges. “Experimental research, statistical analysis of historical crop yield data, and process-based computer simulations all indicate that human-caused climate change is already affecting crops, in some cases for the better and in other cases for the worse,” said Dr. Jeff Amthor, the study’s lead author, and assistant vice president at AIR Worldwide. “Perhaps of more importance than effects of recent climate trends on crops are the well-established possibilities for future, more extreme climate changes involving more frequent and more damaging events reducing productivity of major crops including corn, rice, wheat, soybean, cotton and the other staples of human food, fiber, and biofuel across many geographies. In any case, we presently face considerable uncertainty about the timing and magnitudes of potentially negative effects of future climate variation and change on crops.” Download “Quantifying the Impacts of Climate Change on U.S. Corn Yields” here: http://airww.co/climateagreport About AIR WorldwideAIR Worldwide (AIR) provides risk modeling solutions that make individuals, businesses, and society more resilient to extreme events.

New York-based MHC is a member of the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies and provides personal, commercial and farm insurance via New York state agency Statewide Underwriting Services. Verisk’s ISO ERC solution helps insurers stay current and implement the necessary updates ISO makes to its advisory loss costs, rules and forms for a range of insurance classes and reduces the time and effort required to analyze regular ISO updates, eliminating tedious work and quickening ratings workflows. Eddie Harper President and CEO of Statewide Underwriting Services said of the agreement, “We were impressed by both the Sequel technology and expertise and the fact that Sequel is a Verisk solution was an important component in our decision making. Like many agencies and insurers, moving to ISO ERC for rating support is key to providing an efficient service to our customers. However, it was also important to upgrade our underwriting, policy administration and claims platform overall, hence the dialogue with Verisk. Verisk’s Sequel suite has a range of leading-edge solutions and the expertise to support MGAs, coverholders and insurers on a global basis.” Rob Stavrou Chief Commercial Officer – U.S. and APAC over Verisk’s Sequel solutions, said of the implementation, “We are delighted to work with Eddie and his team at Statewide Underwriting Services and MHC. In addition to migrating to ISO ERC for rating support many insurers need to upgrade their underwriting, policy administration and claims platforms to compete and meet the expectations of their clients. The two go hand in hand. We aim to provide scalable solutions that capture data and integrate with distribution channels and third-party data critical to supporting efficient underwriting and product development.” Verisk’s Sequel solution suite offers full end-to-end management of insurance and reinsurance business, offering clients a clearer vision to grow their business with greater efficiency, flexibility and data governance. Verisk offers Sequel across the global insurance markets from offices in Jersey City, New Jersey; London, England; and Malaga, Spain.

company,1614596640,AIR to Make its Catastrophe Exposure Database Schema Available as an Open Standard,66824767,,VRSK,Yahoo,"Insurance industry will be able to more easily transfer exposure data, increasing efficiency and use of analytics to make better risk management decisionsBoston, March 01, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide today announced that it is making its Catastrophe Exposure Data Exchange (CEDETM) database schema available as an open standard in order to facilitate accurate, efficient and transparent data exchange throughout the insurance value chain, allowing companies to make better risk management decisions. AIR Worldwide is a Verisk (Nasdaq:VRSK) business. “We applaud AIR’s decision to make CEDE an open standard and for their support of efforts to encourage open and transparent data standards in the insurance industry,” said Sean Ringsted, chief risk officer at Chubb. “Efficiency is critical in a competitive marketplace, and an open standard reduces friction, facilitates the transfer of data with our trading partners and encourages the use of analytics for all parties involved; ultimately improving service to our customers.” “RenaissanceRe has been a strong supporter of increasing access to exposure data to build a more risk-resilient world. We recognize AIR’s commitment to open data standards over the past three decades and we welcome this further evolution in their ongoing efforts to make data transfer as seamless as possible,” said Ian Branagan, EVP group chief risk officer at RenaissanceRe. “As the digital needs of the market evolve, there is a recognition across the industry that data standards benefit everyone and open source approaches such as AIR’s help facilitate richer business interactions.” AIR has long been a proponent of open standards and in 1993 developed UNICEDE®, a globally accepted industry data format to standardize insurance data exchange. CEDE is the open database standard developed by AIR to facilitate accurate and transparent data exchange and to encourage model development. AIR’s open data license is based on Apache 2.0, which is recognized worldwide and promotes efficiency and interoperability. The open standards license allows AIR clients and partners to use the CEDE format as an internal repository which allows for better collaboration and innovation. Additionally, AIR actively supports the Open Exposure Data Format (OED) by freely providing its CEDE format as the database structure for models running on Oasis LMF, an open source nonprofit loss modeling framework. “AIR’s exposure data schema is part of a broader industry call for open and transparent data formats, and we are proud to be a part of the solution by offering an open data standard,” said Bill Churney, president of Verisk’s AIR Worldwide. “Having an open data standard will allow the industry to adopt this common data format and more easily transfer exposure data across the insurance value chain.” About AIR WorldwideAIR Worldwide (AIR) provides risk modeling solutions that make individuals, businesses, and society more resilient to extreme events.
