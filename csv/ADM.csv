Nevertheless, let’s give credit where it’s due. The IRS had the good sense to know that many Americans were hurting. Therefore, it decided to extend its tax filing deadline to May 17. If you’re a procrastinator, you’ll soon get your tax refund, which brings up the idea of best stocks to buy with it. First, let me just say the obvious. A tax refund is really just a beautiful American euphemism for giving Uncle Sam an interest-free loan. But that’s the mentality that you find yourself in if you’re a worker bee: You wait for that one day of the year when you get a special treat. Instead, if you were in business for yourself, you could hustle for multiple special days to buy all the best stocks. Still, working for a major corporation has its advantages, such as paid time off, health insurance and income stability, among many other benefits. Therefore, I can appreciate why many Americans eagerly wait for the “refund.” According to CNBC, the average refund size is a hefty $2,893. That amounts to $241 a month, money that you could have put to work through consistent contributions toward the best stocks to buy instead of loaning it to the federal government.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips It’s just something to think about. Even if you don’t make the leap from a W2 employee to, say, a 1099 contractor, you should consult with your professional tax or financial advisor — which is not me, to be clear — to streamline your finances in the future. You want your money to benefit you, not anyone else and certainly not a giant bureaucracy. Anyways, if you’re the average tax payer, you have roughly $3,000 to play with. And if you kept some of your stimulus checks (assuming you were eligible), you have even more funds at your disposal. Here then are seven best stocks to buy with your newfound riches. The Top 7 Ways to Invest In Semiconductors Now Based on the volatile circumstances in the market, I’m leaning more on the cautious side. However, on this list of stocks to buy, you’ll find some speculative ideas if that’s more of your flavor. McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (NASDAQ:KTOS) H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) Smith & Wesson Brands (NASDAQ:SWBI) Cinemark (NYSE:CNK) Stocks to Buy: McDonald’s (MCD) Source: ATIKAN PORNCHAIPRASIT / Shutterstock.com Unsurprisingly, one of the worst-hit sectors from the novel coronavirus outbreak was the restaurant industry. Specifically, the mom-and-pops that have far fewer resources suffered immeasurably, leading to organizations starting initiatives to encourage the public to support local small businesses. While noble, I must say that from a personal perspective, I’m not seeing much evidence of traction. Every time I pass by a McDonald’s, I see the drive-thru packed to the hilt. Having visited McDonald’s pre-pandemic to check out the company’s rebranding campaign, I must say that its drive-thru lanes move very quickly. Still, it’s a bit alarming that American consumers would seemingly rather support big business than small. Whatever. When it comes to seeking out the best stocks to buy, you can’t rely on sentiment. Instead, the hard facts speak for themselves. In its quarter ended March 31, 2021, McDonald’s generated revenue of $5.12 billion. That’s up 2% from the same quarter two years ago, and just under parity from three years ago. This suggests the Golden Arches could be on the mend, which would be very good for MCD stock. Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) Source: Shutterstock.com Arguably the least exciting name on this list of best stocks to buy, I wouldn’t ordinarily be so bullish on Archer Daniels Midland if indeed we were in a decidedly optimistic phase in the market. Right now, though, it seems the overriding mood is to deleverage from risk-on assets to risk-off plays. If so, I don’t think you could get any more risk-off in the equities space than ADM stock. As a food-processing giant, Archer Daniels Midland represents one of the prime places to put your tax refund to work. Here’s the philosophy. Just prior to the pandemic, most Americans used their refund to pay down debt. Therefore, if you’re going to invest the money instead, you want to get into high-quality names with a high probability of upside movement. Since we all have to eat, that right there makes ADM worth considering as one of the best stocks to buy as a long-term consideration. 7 Industrial Stocks to Buy for a Rock-Solid Foundation But specific to our circumstances, Archer Daniels is putting up great numbers. In the first quarter of 2021, the company posted revenue of $18.9 billion, up 5% from Q4 2020. Dominion Energy (D) Source: ying / Shutterstock.com With the global markets turning shaky over recent sessions, the best stocks to buy are what many analysts consider the safest ones. Under this context, you could do a lot worse than Dominion Energy. A power and energy company — and not to be confused with that other company of the same name — Dominion Energy has an irreplaceable advantage: When people flip the switch, they expect the lights to turn on. Indeed, bad stuff happens when the lights stay off for an extended period. Beyond that, we live in a technologically dependent world. We cannot live without power, and therefore, people will do anything to keep those lights on. It’s somewhat cynical, but it supports the case for D stock. Another reason why Dominion is one of the best stocks to buy with your tax refund is that utilities tend to perform relatively well during a deflationary environment. I’d argue that’s exactly what we’re seeing. Our national gross domestic product (GDP) is back up to $22 trillion, yet our employment level is still down about 5%. Productivity up but worker base down translates to deflation. Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (KTOS) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com As a defense contractor, Kratos Defense & Security Solutions is a tricky beast. Ordinarily, you wouldn’t expect a left-leaning presidential administration to be supportive of an investment like KTOS stock. Certainly, the comparison to the very pro-military administration under former President Donald Trump isn’t favorable for Kratos. However, you’d have to be living under a rock not to notice multiple geopolitical rumblings. First, you have the tense relationship between President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Further, both confirmed and suspected Russian-backed cyberattacks put a dark cloud over U.S.-Russia relations, which may bolster military related names like KTOS stock. Second, our continued rivalry with China, along with the ever-present threat of nuclear-armed North Korea demonstrates that we must direct resources into maintaining our military advantage. Specifically, Kratos’ specialty in advanced war machines such as drones might make it one of the best stocks to buy. 7 High Quality Industrial Stocks to Buy Now Nevertheless, KTOS is a stock you want to trickle your way into. Financially, Kratos’ revenue growth has started to sag. That said, if tensions heat up with our adversaries — and that looks to be the case — KTOS at current prices may be a viable discount. H&R Block (HRB) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com I’d be remiss not to mention H&R Block in an article about best stocks to buy with your tax refund. Now, time for a confession. Over the past two years or so, I’ve supported the bullish narrative of HRB stock, only to be disappointed. Finally, though, the tax-preparation company is rewarding its longsuffering shareholders. On a year-to-date basis, HRB stock is up 59%. Better yet, momentum remains strong, with shares up nearly 15% over the trailing month. Part of the reason is a factor I’ve long discussed: the transition to the gig economy. Prior to the pandemic, many young folks wanted to live life on their terms. During the lockdowns, many more people got a taste of the gig worker’s culture. As the New York Times pointed out, worker bees want to keep the benefits of telecommuting. Undoubtedly, some will make the plunge. But tax preparation for 1099 contractors is far different from W2s, which bolsters HRB. Also, several investors got rich off cryptocurrencies in 2021. That, too, is a serious taxation concern, one that the IRS will prosecute with extreme prejudice. So, how’s H&R Block looking now? Smith & Wesson Brands (SWBI) Source: Supakorn Pe / Shutterstock.com Another difficult name to figure out among best stocks to buy with your tax refund is Smith & Wesson Brands. I include it because there’s a chance SWBI stock could fly higher from here due to a compelling mix of the unprecedented pandemic and political catalysts. Still, it’s a risky one, so don’t go too overboard. Let’s start with some hard data. According to FBI background checks for firearm sales, the industry has sold just under 16 million guns between January through April. That’s on pace for yet another record-breaking year for gun sales. Still, April sales slipped 25% from March. Is that a sign that SWBI stock is in trouble? It’s not the most encouraging statistic. But we should note that April sales historically tend to be weak relative to March. Further, while the pandemic sparked gun sales in 2020, this year, the Democrats could do the same in 2021. After some ugly incidents following the 2020 election results, some fractures have opened within the Republican party. That sets the possibility that Democrats may retain power, which is fundamentally bad news for firearm advocates due to the threat of increased gun control. 7 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $3 But this could also spark panicked purchasing. Therefore, you should watch this space. Cinemark (CNK) Source: LukeandKarla.Travel/Shutterstock.com With Cinemark, I’ve saved the riskiest idea for last. While CNK has the comeback narrative to be among the best stocks to buy period, it could also fall flat on its face. Therefore, you only want to spare a tiny portion of your refund on this cineplex operator. While so many industries suffered from the pandemic, companies like Cinemark were on the brink of absolute catastrophe. That’s because without people flowing into their movie theaters, there was really no way to generate any revenue. But now that several states are loosening their Covid-19 protocol, CNK stock pinged signs of life. On a year-to-date basis, shares are up 28%. In the trailing month, momentum continues to be strong, up nearly 9%. But can the cineplex industry harness these gains into something sustainably substantive? I think it comes down to whether people can remember what it was like to be normal and human again. Clearly, some cities are doing much better than others. But should a sense of decency and civility return, the pent-up demand for the big-screen experience could swing the needle favorably for CNK stock.

China’s expanding hog herds need soybean meal, so the Asian nation has been buying massive amounts of the oilseed off global markets.The economic recovery from the pandemic is driving demand for agricultural goods generally, draining stockpiles and fueling food-inflation concerns.Restaurants are reopening amid easing Covid-19 restrictions need vegetable oils for cooking, and the renewable diesel industry is expanding. All of that is ramping up demand for the bean’s oil. On Monday, Archer-Daniels-Midland said it was building a new $350 million soy crushing facility.A U.S. report due Wednesday will give an updated look at expectations for global grain inventories.Soybeans for July delivery rose by as much as 2.4% to $16.255 a bushel in Chicago.(Updates with soybean oil, ADM commentary in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=851200fdba03f8c1b3f15fa0a8f770585f9dcacff77416f8e2cf4a3723ced57d

ADM has been seeing higher demand from its food, feed, industrial and biofuel customers, as well as from producers of renewable diesel. The new plant, which calls for an estimated outlay of about $350 million, will have the capacity to process 150 thousand bushels of soybeans daily. ADM expects the plant to be completed before the harvest season of 2023. ADM President of Ag Services and Oilseeds business Greg Morris said, “ADM’s commitment to preserving and protecting our planet’s resources stretches from the farm gate to the food on our tables and the renewable fuel we put in our vehicles.” Morris added, “This exciting new project allows us to partner with North Dakota farmers to further advance the role of agriculture in addressing climate change through the production of low carbon feedstocks for products such as renewable diesel.” Furthermore, ADM will invest about $25 million on the expansion of its refining and storage capacity at its Quincy, Illinois crush and refining plant. The added capacity is estimated to be ready by Q1 2022. (See ADM stock analysis on TipRanks) On May 3, Barclays analyst Benjamin Theurer reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $75 (10.9% upside potential) from $60. Theurer attributed the upward target price revision to a systemic shift in the Chinese pork industry, future benefits from renewable green diesel, and adjusted operating profit of $1 billion from Nutrition. Based on 7 Buys and 3 Holds, consensus on the Street is that ADM is a Moderate Buy. The average analyst price target of $68.70 implies the stock is fairly priced. Shares have gained about 85.8% over the past year.

But they’re buying wheat” as well.The Asian nation’s soaring demand for animal feed has helped lift crop prices to the highest in years, benefitting traders like ADM and signaling higher meat prices for consumers.Chinese hogs aren’t the only culprits behind pricey corn. The world’s cattle, hogs and chickens are all gobbling up the grain faster than farmers can grow it. Corn is so expensive that it has at times surpassed wheat, a rare occurrence.Earlier this month, a type of wheat grown in the southern U.S. Plains that’s usually used to make flour for bread traded at the biggest discount to corn since 1977.The disparity prompted some U.S. cattle feeders to buy wheat that will get harvested beginning around June.“We are running out of the corn in the country and wheat got really cheap,” said Joe Nussmeier, a broker at Frontier Futures in Minneapolis. By mid-June, “the only thing to feed critters at that time will be wheat.”There are risks, though. Wheat shouldn’t be fed to younger cattle and if cattle eat too much wheat, they get bloated, according to Penn State Extension research.

ADM, the largest publicly traded crop handler, will provide some insight on its first quarter, when the Chicago-based company reports earnings Tuesday.“Industry economics are the strongest since 2011-2014,” said Bank of America analyst Luke Washer, who initiated a buy rating on ADM last week. “ADM will be a key benefactor of a renewed ag cycle that is expected to last a few years and potentially much longer.”ADM shares have climbed about 18% in 2021, compared to the S&P 500 gains of 11%. Shares for Bunge, which reports earnings May 4, are up about 30% year-to-date.Prices for corn, soybeans and wheat started to climb in the third quarter of 2020 and have barely let up since, with prices extending gains to fresh multiyear peaks in the wake of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s smaller-than-expected planting outlook on March 31.China’s crop imports are likely to stay strong until at least the end of the year, with Cargill Inc. saying agricultural commodities are poised for a “mini supercycle.” But a prolonged bull cycle is unlikely are farmers are quick to plant more every year, boosting supplies quicker than in other commodities markets like metals, which have to be mined.The backdrop of tighter crop supplies is the opposite of the glut that capped trading margins in recent years. China’s expanding hog herd has the U.S. shipping record amounts of corn to the Asian country. More cars and trucks on roads has lifted demand of corn-based ethanol and biodiesel made from soybeans.“My expectation is for the first quarter and at least the first half of 2021 that we’ll see the continuation of favorable grain-merchandising conditions,” said Seth Goldstein, analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. “We’re at the point where grain trading is at peak profitability. Just a couple of years ago, we were at the bottom of the cycle and now we’re at the top.”There are some pressure points, though. Corn and soy supplies are getting tight enough to pinch profits at processing plants. Soybean crush margins are sharply lower from the same time a year ago and the volume of soybeans crushed in the U.S. has declined from 2020 levels two months in a row.Meanwhile, top global soy producer Brazil cut its requirement for biodiesel blending in diesel fuel to 10% from 13% to ease the impact of high soybean oil prices. That move, according to BofA’s Washer, “threatens soybean crush demand and highlights the risks associated with policy changes in Brazil.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=41edec148ce32c0ab4bf7011b18e50604e2ab2d147c235ab5330f2e892a6c149

Alternatives to shrimp and shellfish, plant-based cheeses and ready-to-eat protein snacks are all becoming more popular, he said.“Awareness and interest in plant-based proteins as an alternative to meat is growing,” the Shanghai-based Liu said in an interview. Chinese people are experimenting with plant-based options as they look for protein-rich diets that are sustainable, convenient and meet food safety standards, he said.ADM -- one of the big four agricultural traders along with Cargill Inc., Bunge Ltd., and Louis Dreyfus Co. -- already has extensive operations throughout China and will be investing more in alternative proteins there, Liu said. The company forecasts China’s plant-based protein market will grow to $14.5 billion in 2025 from under $10 billion in 2018.The rising interest in plant-based protein dovetails with Beijing’s increasing focus on the environment and food security. Self-sufficiency featured strongly in China’s latest five-year plan that came after the country’s hog herd had been devastated by African swine fever and the trade war with the U.S. as well as the Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the fragility of global supply chains.Diversifying protein intake to plant-based sources could help China cope with future meat shortages, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Alvin Tai and Ashley Kim said in a report released in February. Reducing meat consumption is also part of China’s strategy to reduce its carbon intensity by more than 65% from 2005 levels by 2030, they said.The growing number of Chinese flexitarians -- people who are mostly vegetarian but occasionally eat meat or fish -- is helping to spur alternative food startups across the country, Liu said. “Consumers are moving away from an obsession with calorie counts to focusing on food’s intrinsic value.”Many China-based companies will continue to increase production capabilities as the popularity of plant-based meat continues to rise, Fitch Solutions said in a March 31 note.OmniFoods is distributing a ground pork substitute in Hong Kong, and mainland company Whole Perfect Food sells vegan bacon. Chinese startups Zhenmeat and Starfield Food & Science Technology, meanwhile, have sought funding to develop their own meat substitutes.Global InterestA bevy of global food titans are also seeking to get in on the action. Cargill started a plant-based meat products brand called PlantEver that’s sold directly to Chinese consumers last year, while industry pioneer Beyond Meat Inc. opened its first manufacturing facility outside the U.S. near Shanghai this week. Livekindly Collective, a group of alternative protein brands steered by a former Unilever Plc executive, also has plans to expand in China.ADM, which says it’s now the largest plant-based protein provider in the world, has for years been diversifying away from trading bulk crops and into higher-margin food manufacturing. The company expects its nutrition unit, which contains its plant-based protein business, to become as large or even larger than its legacy business of buying and shipping crops by 2050.See also: Beyond Meat Has an Ancient Foe in China -- Tofu: David FicklingOne of the biggest potential hurdles for the industry in China is competition from long-existing and cheaper soy-based products such as tofu, Liu said.“While it might take some time to educate consumers about the new generation of plant-based food, the demand for plant-based foods in China will have a huge market potential once perception starts to shift and the taste and flavor of plant-based foods continue to improve,” he said.(Updates with comment from Fitch Solutions in 8th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0311fe3518dec149029c4e5aa80c34f39def8459e2a57b4762fbfc8f18133dc8

Rivals Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. and Bunge Ltd. are working on making plants more efficient, and Andersons Inc. set up a desk to trade feedstocks for the green fuel.The traders are targeting the growing market as American refiners including Phillips 66, Marathon Petroleum Corp., HollyFrontier Corp. and Valero Energy Corp. jump on the green diesel bandwagon. Renewable diesel is a fuel made from biomass that has the same properties of the fossil fuel, and it’s likely to benefit from President Joe Biden’s sweeping climate agenda that signals a push away from fossil fuels. While many refiners will seek to produce it from discarded cooking oil or animal fats, they will need to turn to traditional vegetable oils made from crops like corn and soybeans to meet demand.“We think it’s going to be a big market,” said Pat Bowe, chief executive officer of crop handler Andersons. “It’s a really important demand driver for the fats and oils complex that we haven’t seen in a long time.”The increased demand comes just as restaurants across America are reopening, boosting demand for cooking oils, and driving miles recover to pre-pandemic levels. That’s boosted competition with the food industry, which uses the oils in everything from Nutella -- a key consumer of palm oil -- to plant-based burgers, many of which have soybean oil as a key ingredient.Soybean oil demand could increase by half a billion pounds this year due to the extra demand from the renewable diesel industry, Juan Luciano, ADM’s CEO said in January. If two-thirds of the planned renewable diesel capacity gets built over the next three to four years, that will require about 15 billion pounds of feedstock, Ray Young, the company’s chief financial officer said this month.“Regardless of how you do the arithmetic, it’s going to be an environment where soybean oil is going to be very, very valued by the industry as an important feedstock to support the growth of renewable green diesel,” Young said at an investment conference. “We think this is going to be a very favorable multiyear phenomenon for the North American soy crush industry.”Cargill’s investments include doubling soybean processing capacity at its plant in Sidney, Ohio, and expanding processing by 10% in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. ADM said it’s working on improving efficiency at its plants to provide incremental supply while Andersons set up a trading desk in Kansas City last year to buy and sell feedstocks including soybean oil, tallow and the corn oil it produces from its many ethanol plants, Bowe said in an interview last month.Bunge, the world’s largest oilseeds processor, said it plans to allocate some capital for investments in the area, which include increasing tank-storage capacity and improving efficiency of its refineries. While the traders all want to supply the renewable diesel industry, they don’t want to produce it themselves.The market is already taking notice of the new demand. Soybean oil futures have jumped almost 25% this year as palm oil also extended gains. Demand is also gaining as blending traditional biodiesel into fossil fuels has become more profitable with the rise in crude oil prices.“Renewable diesel should see growing demand as long as government incentives remain in place,” said Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. “If the Biden administration is able to get clean fuel standards passed for heavy trucks, the U.S. would likely see a spike in demand for renewable diesel.”But there’s also the risk of over-investing. Some traditional biodiesel plants may end up closing as a result of the renewable diesel boom, while too many traders fighting for one market could end up squeezing margins.“We’re going to be very thoughtful and show a lot of discipline, which this industry needs to do,” Bunge CEO Greg Heckman said in February, adding that the company was being “thoughtful about how we serve this growing demand that is structural and is going to be in place.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3bf7b6ce2b9a147f47d50847549d9dce52999db43c7b3aa2e18eecd89e7085a8
