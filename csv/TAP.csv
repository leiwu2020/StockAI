(""HEXO"") (TSX: HEXO; NYSE: HEXO) and Zenabis Global Inc. (""Zenabis"") (TSX: ZENA) are pleased to announce that they have completed the previously announced arrangement (the ""Arrangement""), pursuant to which HEXO has acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Zenabis (""Zenabis Shares"") by way of a plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). ""Today is another great day for HEXO,"" said HEXO CEO and co-founder Sebastien St-Louis. ""With the acquisition of Zenabis, we are actively positioning HEXO for future expansion in Canada, Europe and beyond. This deal will strengthen our domestic brands, offer a foothold in Europe and provide significant accretive synergies as we continue towards our goal of becoming EPS positive and a top-three global cannabis products company."" Under the terms of the Arrangement, each former Zenabis shareholder is now entitled to receive 0.01772 of a common share in the capital of HEXO (each whole share, a ""HEXO Share"") for each Zenabis Share held immediately prior to the Arrangement (the ""Consideration""). It is anticipated that the Zenabis Shares will be de-listed from the Toronto Stock Exchange (the ""TSX"") as of the close of trading on or about June 2, 2021. In order to receive the Consideration, registered holders of Zenabis Shares will be required to deposit their share certificate(s) representing Zenabis Shares, together with a duly completed letter of transmittal, with TSX Trust Company, the depositary under the Arrangement. Shareholders whose Zenabis Shares are registered in the name of a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or other nominee should contact their nominee regarding the receipt of the Consideration. Further information about the Arrangement is set forth in the materials prepared by Zenabis in respect of the special meeting of Zenabis shareholders held on May 13, 2021 (the ""Meeting""), which were mailed to Zenabis shareholders and filed under Zenabis' profile on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR) at www.sedar.com. Warrants Warrants to purchase Zenabis Shares, other than those exercised prior to June 1, 2021 (the ""Effective Time""), will continue to remain outstanding as warrants of Zenabis, which, upon exercise, will entitle the holder thereof to receive, in lieu of the number of Zenabis Shares to which such holder was theretofore entitled upon exercise of such Zenabis warrants, the Consideration in the form of HEXO Shares that such holder would have been entitled to be issued and receive if, immediately prior to the Effective Time, such holder had been the registered holder of the number of Zenabis Shares to which such holder was theretofore entitled upon exercise of such Zenabis warrants. All other terms governing the warrants, including, but not limited to, the expiry term, exercise price and the conditions to and the manner of exercise, will be the same as the terms that were in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall be governed by the terms of the applicable warrant indenture or the applicable warrant certificate. As required by the warrant indenture in respect of the applicable warrants, HEXO has entered into a supplemental warrant indenture in respect of such warrant indenture governing applicable warrants. A copy of the supplemental warrant indenture will be available on Zenabis' and HEXO's respective SEDAR profiles at www.sedar.com. Listed Zenabis Warrants Prior to the completion of the Arrangement, Zenabis had outstanding one class of warrants to purchase Zenabis Shares listed on the TSX under the trading symbol 'ZENA.WT' (the ""Listed Zenabis Warrants""). The Listed Zenabis Warrants will continue trading on the TSX, but will commence trading under the symbol 'HEXO.WT' as of June 3, 2021. The Listed Zenabis Warrants will remain listed on the TSX until the earliest to occur of their exercise, expiry or de-listing. HEXO has entered into a supplemental warrant indenture in respect of the Listed Zenabis Warrants, a copy of which will be available on Zenabis' and HEXO's respective SEDAR profiles at www.sedar.com. Options, Deferred Share Units and Restricted Share Units Holders of Zenabis options have received replacement options under the Arrangement, exercisable for HEXO Shares at the same conversion ratio applicable to the Zenabis Shares. All other terms and conditions of the replacement options, including the term of expiry, vesting, conditions to and manner of exercising, are the same as the Zenabis options for which they were exchanged. Holders of Zenabis deferred share units or restricted share units have received replacement deferred share units or restricted share units, as applicable, under the Arrangement, exercisable for HEXO Shares at the same conversion ratio applicable to the Zenabis Shares. All other terms and conditions of the replacement deferred share units and restricted share units, including the term of expiry, vesting, conditions to and manner of exercising, are the same as the Zenabis deferred share units or restricted share units for which they were exchanged. Other Matters Zenabis has been granted exemptive relief from certain continuous disclosure and insider reporting requirements by the applicable securities regulators. Holders of Listed Zenabis Warrants are therefore directed to reference, and rely on, the public disclosure filings of HEXO.

HEXO’s and Zenabis’ operations are subject to a variety of laws, regulations and guidelines relating to the marketing, acquisition, manufacture, management, transportation, storage, sale and disposal of cannabis but also including laws and regulations relating to health and safety, the conduct of operations and the protection of the environment. To the knowledge of HEXO’s management, HEXO and Zenabis have been and, following the completion of the Arrangement continue to be in compliance with all such laws.

Echelon Capital Markets (a member of Echelon Wealth Partners Inc.) is acting as financial advisor to Zenabis in connection with the Transaction.

The Analyst: Andrea Teixeira upgraded Keurig Dr Pepper's stock from Neutral to Outperform with an unchanged $33 price target. The analyst downgraded Molson Coors from Neutral to Underweight with an unchanged $45 price target. The Keurig Dr Pepper Thesis: Keurig Dr Pepper has seen impressive gains in its single-serve coffee machine and this could translate to long-term growth potential, Teixeira wrote in the note. Management will be in a stronger position to reinvest in the coffee brand and this could fuel longer-term topline growth. The stock has seen its multiple expand by 200 basis points since the start of March and there is still room to run as investors ""continue to gain better appreciation"" for a double-digit earnings growth profile. Encouragingly, management has a plan in place to offset some of the inflationary pressures, including upgraded manufacturing facilities and expense savings from debt paydown. Related Link: Keurig Dr. Pepper CEO On Coffee And Beverage Trends: 2020 Growth Part Of Longer-Term Momentum The Molson Coors Thesis: Teixeira said Molson Coors' timeline to recovery is ""highly uncertain"" amid cold weather in Texas, new lockdowns in Europe, the company's disclosure of a cybersecurity attack that impacted its order fulfillment, and requirements for management to reinvest in marketing to stimulus above-average growth. Management deserves credit for its success in seltzer and other high-growth categories but at the same time, Molson's exposure to the category accounts for approximately 10% of US sales. ""As such, given the headwinds in its core business, we see risk to the company's ability to meet its FY2020 financial guidance of mid-single-digits top-line growth and flat EBITDA growth,"" the analyst wrote. KDP, TAP Price Action: Shares of Keurig Dr Pepper hit a new 52-week high of $34.58 Friday morning and were trading higher by 1.2% at publication time. Shares of Molson Coors were lower by 1% at $48.65.

company,1616167083,ROCE Insights For Molson Coors Brewing,66536729,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,TAP,Yahoo,"During Q4, Molson Coors Brewing (NYSE:TAP) brought in sales totaling $2.29 billion. However, earnings decreased 352.35%, resulting in a loss of $1.28 billion. Molson Coors Brewing earned $508.30 million, and sales totaled $2.75 billion in Q3. What Is Return On Capital Employed? Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in Molson Coors Brewing's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q4, Molson Coors Brewing posted an ROCE of -0.1%. It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future. View more earnings on TAP ROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Molson Coors Brewing is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.
