The investment is part of the three companies’ push to decarbonize the air travel industry with electric aircraft.



ES-19 is the electric aircraft that Heart Aerospace is currently working on and at the heart of the investment. The electric aircraft utilizes electric motors instead of jet engines and will therefore have zero operational emissions. It is designed to operate on the same types of batteries used in electric cars but with an expected range of up to 250 miles.



United Airlines plans to bolster its fleet with 100  electric aircraft by the end of the decade once deemed operational and approved. Its strategic partner, Mesa Airlines, also plans to bolster its fleet with 100 of the ES-19 electric planes. (See United Airlines stock chart on TipRanks)



The deal with Heart Aerospace is part of United Airlines' investment drive focused on sustainability as it looks to enhance carbon-neutral air travel. The airline plans to be greenhouse gas-free by 2050.



""We recognize that customers want even more ownership of their own carbon emissions footprint. We're proud to partner with Mesa Air Group to bring electric aircraft to our customers earlier than any other US airliner,” said Michael Leskinen, UAV's President.



Yesterday, Argus Research analyst John Staszak downgraded United Airlines to a Hold from a Buy. According to the analyst, the airline’s reliance on international flights is a problem in the near term.



“We think that UAL's efforts to cut costs and upgrade its fleet bode well for future results. However, in the near term, we think that investors will prefer airlines that are less reliant on corporate and international flights and opt instead for the shares of low-cost carriers that are able to significantly reduce debt,” Staszak said.



Consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 4 Buys, 10 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average United Airlines price target of $60.77 implies 25.30% upside potential to current levels.



UAL scores a 7 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, suggesting that the stock is likely to perform in line with market averages.

The airline plans to add about 150 daily flights to warm-weather destinations in the U.S. for winter holiday travel. Additionally, the airline plans to offer 30% more flights to Latin America’s leisure destinations than it did in 2019. United stock rose 2.90% on Friday to close at $51.10.



United’s expanded winter schedule will begin in November and run through March 2022. The U.S. destinations the airline plans to serve with more flights during winter include Las Vegas, Jacksonville, Ft. Myers, San Diego, Charleston, Phoenix, and Palm Beach. In Latin America, the company plans to offer more flights heading to Belize City, Cozumel, Liberia, and Nassau.



""As pandemic restrictions ease, people are becoming more confident in planning travel further in advance, so we want to make sure to offer our customers as much choice as possible,"" said Ankit Gupta, United’s Vice President of Network Planning.



The airline is expanding its capacity to meet the growing demand for travel. It has ordered more than 270 mainline jets to add to its fleet. (See United Airlines stock charts on TipRanks).



UBS analyst Myles Walton recently reiterated a Buy rating on United stock with a price target of $67. Walton’s price target suggests 31.12% upside potential.



The analyst noted that United’s bulk order represents more than just an aircraft purchase. Instead, management explains it as a plan to align the airline’s network, fleet, and products to its hubs. Walton further observes that the main goal of the purchase is to ""upguage"" United’s current fleet.



""The plan calls for their average North American flight to go from 104 seats to 134 seats in 2026 which will be a big contributor to their goal of reducing CASM-ex by 8%,"" commented Walton.



Consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 6 Buys, 8 Holds, and 2 Sells. The average United Airlines price target of $60.60 implies 18.59% upside potential to current levels.



UAL scores a 6 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, suggesting that the stock is likely to perform in line with market averages.
