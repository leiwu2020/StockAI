The company has an average price target of $470.29 with a high of $600.00 and a low of $375.00. This current average has increased by 8.11% from the previous average price target of $435.0. How Are Analyst Ratings Determined? Ratings come from analysts, or specialists within banking and financial systems that report for specific stocks or defined sectors (typically once per quarter for each stock). Analysts usually derive their information from company conference calls and meetings, financial statements, and conversations with important insiders to reach their decisions. Analysts may suggest actions like ""buy"", ""sell"", ""hold"", or similar verbage for each stock based on research compiled from the corresponding company. Analysts who suggest ""buy"" are telling traders to purchase the stock based on forecasted growth. On the flip side, analysts who suggest ""sell"" are telling traders to dump the stock because of a similarly forecasted decline. Analysts who suggest ""hold"" are telling investors that they see short-term or mid-term stagnation and to maintain their positions on the stock. Some analysts publish their predictions for metrics such as growth estimates, earnings, and revenue to provide additional guidance with their ratings. When using analyst ratings, it is important to keep in mind that stock and sector analysts are also human and are only offering their opinions to investors.

The news pushed shares of Boston Private Financial Holdings (BPFH) up 24.2% in Monday's extended market trading. Meanwhile, SVB Financial stock declined marginally.Per the terms of the deal, SVB Financial (SIVB) will pay $2.10 in cash and 0.0228 of its common stock for each share of Boston Private. The transaction has been approved by both companies’ board of directors and is anticipated to be completed in mid-2021.According to SVB Financial, the “Combined private bank and wealth management assets under management would be $17.7 billion,” based on Sep. 30, 2020 figures. (See SIVB stock analysis on TipRanks).SVB Financial CEO Greg Becker said, ""Boston Private's experienced and well-regarded team, robust service offering, and advanced technology platform will significantly bolster our private bank and wealth management capabilities and enhance our ability to offer products and services tailored to the needs of founders, executives and investors.""Ahead of this announcement, Wells Fargo analyst Jared Shaw upgraded SVB Financial to Hold from Sell and raised the price target to $325 (16.1% downside potential) from $210. Shaw sees improved profitability prospects for mid-cap banks in 2021 and 2022. The analyst said that these banks have entered 2021 with improved capital adequacy and underwriting standards. He added that broader industry lending standards have also improved.Meanwhile, the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook with an analyst consensus of a Moderate Buy based on 6 Buys and 6 Holds. The average analyst price target of $365.50 implies downside potential of about 5.6% to current levels.
