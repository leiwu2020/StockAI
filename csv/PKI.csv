Following the news, shares of the company rose marginally to close at $153.20 in Tuesday’s trading session.

(See PerkinElmer stock chart on TipRanks)



Recently, Wolfe Research analyst Liza Garcia upgraded the stock to a Buy with a price target of $172 (12.3% upside potential).



According to Garcia, the company is in line with its target of achieving revenues of over $4 billion in 2023. However, the decline in COVID testing ""has overshadowed the positive story.""



The stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 2 Buys and 1 Hold. The average PerkinElmer analyst price target of $154 implies that shares are almost fully valued, with 0.5% upside potential from current levels. Shares have gained 54.4% over the past year. 



PerkinElmer scores an 8 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system. This indicates that the stock is likely to outperform compared to market averages.

The study is funded by the Department of Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) through the UK Vaccines Taskforce and is being delivered through a partnership between government, hVIVO (part of Open Orphan plc), Imperial College London, and The Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust. The groundbreaking UK COVID-19 Human Challenge Study has global importance as the first study of its type in the world, and the data generated should help to develop vaccines against COVID-19 much more quickly and efficiently. The first stage of the trial, which commenced in March, will enable identification of the most appropriate dose of the virus needed to cause COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a safe and controlled environment. The participants will have a complete analysis of their immune response to infection carried out (including T cells) which should lead to a better understanding of the profile, magnitude, and duration of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. This study will therefore establish an optimised dose and study design that will subsequently be used to evaluate the efficacy of treatment and vaccine candidates, including level and duration of immune protection, in follow-on studies. A custom version of Oxford Immunotec’s T-SPOT Discovery SARS-CoV-2 kit (for research use only) will be used in this study. The kit uses the T-SPOT technology platform, a standardized ELISPOT methodology, to detect the T cell immune response in study subjects. Understanding the T cell immune response, in addition to the antibody response (via serology), may offer additional insights into how the complete immune system responds to infection and vaccination. As T cells are the first responders of the immune system and are known to be long lived, using T cells to measure immune response may overcome some of the limitations of serology testing. A CE marked IVD version of the kit (the T-SPOT.COVID test) is also available from Oxford Immunotec. Dr. Magdalena Dudek, VP, Product Development at Oxford Immunotec said, “The UK COVID-19 Human Challenge Study has global significance, and the potential to be a much more efficient and faster way to understand the disease and how our immune system fights it. We are very excited to be a part of this trial which should accelerate the development of vaccines and treatments against COVID-19. We are proud of our continual partnership with the UK Vaccines Taskforce which enables us to provide T cell testing for this critical clinical trial.” For further information about the study visit: www.ukcovidchallenge.com For further information visit: www.tspotdiscovery.com T-SPOT Discovery SARS-CoV-2 is for research use only, not for use in diagnostic procedures.

The study will monitor the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the immunological response of patients to vaccination. The study will collect samples from 13 sites around the UK. The COV-AD study aims to build on the UK Primary Immunodeficiency Network (UKPIN) data by determining the prevalence, course and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with Primary Antibody Deficiency (PAD)/Secondary Antibody Deficiency (SAD). This study should lead to a clearer understanding of whether individuals with antibody deficiency mount durable immune responses, and if they do not, the impact that has on the virus itself. Development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity to COVID infection or vaccination will be tested by blood sampling to measure specific antibody titre and for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 T cells. The results of this study will be widely applicable to immunosuppressed patients, development of vaccination strategies and the understanding of risk for continuous virus transmission. Oxford Immunotec’s T-SPOT.COVID kit is CE marked for IVD use and will be used to assess the T cell response in patients following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. The kit uses the T-SPOT technology platform, a commercialized, modified ELISPOT platform, which allows for the standardized and reproducible measurement of T cells reactive to SARS-CoV-2. The T-SPOT technology has previously been used in TB testing (the T-SPOT.TB test) where it is known to maintain its high performance even in immunosuppressed individuals. PAD/SAD are a diverse group of disorders, characterised by various degrees of dysfunctional antibody production. Understanding the T cell response to infection or vaccination in study subjects is therefore of critical importance to determining if the immune system is responding in these individuals at all. It could also help to increase the understanding of the role T cells play in combating COVID-19 in the general population. Chief Investigator of COV-AD Professor Alex Richter, of the University of Birmingham, said: “Nationally, a number of patients with immunodeficiency have had severe or prolonged illness with COVID-19. Understanding why some patients do well and others do not, is so important. Being unable to clear the virus is not just a problem to the patient but is potentially a public health problem too.” Dr. Andrew Makin, VP of Medical Affairs at Oxford Immunotec stated; “We are pleased to be partnering with the University of Birmingham on this clinical trial which will help characterize COVID-19 infection in patients with antibody deficiency. Measuring the T cell response in immune deficient patients will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the immune response and inform on the vital role T cells may play in SARS-CoV-2 infection.” For further information visit www.tspotcovid.com.

Oxford Immunotec is collaborating with researchers at the University of Leicester on DIRECT (Determining the Immune Response in Ethnic minority healthcare workers to COVID-19 infection). The study, funded through the National Core Studies group, is actively recruiting healthcare workers in Leicester for detailed analysis of their immune response to infection and / or vaccination (including T cells). This analysis, together with information collected through online questionnaires, will enable researchers to understand whether there are differences in the immune response in different ethnic minority groups, including whether there are differences in the magnitude and duration of this response. The custom version of the T-SPOT Discovery SARS-CoV-2 kit (for research use only) will be used to assess if the vaccination induces a T cell response in study subjects. The kit uses the T-SPOT technology platform, a commercialized, modified ELISPOT platform, which allows for the standardized and reproducible measurement of T cells reactive to SARS-CoV-2. Testing for an immune response using T cells may offer several advantages over conventional antibody testing due to the limitations reported with antibodies, such as antibodies not being present after infection and antibodies waning over time. The T-SPOT Discovery SARS-CoV-2 test has also demonstrated in previous studies that a high SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell response may be associated with protection from infection. Dr. Peter Wrighton-Smith, CEO of Oxford Immunotec said, “We are proud to be partnering with the University of Leicester on this critical clinical trial which will help drive the understanding of the effects of COVID-19 across different ethnic groups.” Dr Manish Pareek, Principal Investigator of DIRECT said, “The immune system is critical to the outcome of COVID-19, including protection against future infection. This study, utilizing a wide range of immune measures including the T-SPOT technology developed by Oxford Immunotec, will allow us to determine differences in the immune response to COVID-19 amongst different ethnic minority groups, which is vital if we are to understand why individuals from ethnic minority groups are disproportionately affected by COVID-19.” Find out more about DIRECT at https://direct.uk-reach.org/ For further information visit: www.tspotdiscovery.com T-SPOT Discovery SARS-CoV-2 is for research use only, not for use in diagnostic procedures.

The company is collaborating with the Oxford Vaccine Group, part of the team that developed the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, who is leading the Com-COV trial. The trial will help understanding of the effects on the immune response when different combinations of approved COVID-19 vaccines are administered for the first and second immunization doses. This study is funded by the UK Vaccine Task Force and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). The Com-COV trial aims to understand how well people’s immune systems respond when they are primed with one type of vaccine, then boosted with another and to see how effective the response is when the second dose is separated from the first dose by different periods of time. The study will also examine how common vaccine reactions, such as fever, are after such “mixed” schedules. The first stage of this program has already recruited 830 participants, but has recently been expanded to include a second stage recruiting an additional 1,050, aged over 50, who will have a complete analysis of their immune response to vaccination carried out (including T cells). Combining vaccines might give broader, longer-lasting immunity against the virus and new variants of it. The study will also give useful information about extending the gap between prime and boost as well as a better understanding of whether combining different vaccines creates a more flexible immunization program, potentially allowing more people to be immunized more quickly. The vaccines being examined in the study are AstraZeneca ChadOx1 nCoV-19, Pfizer BioNTech BNT162b2, the Moderna mRNA vaccine and the protein adjuvant vaccine produced by Novavax. The custom version of the Company’s T-SPOT Discovery SARS-CoV-2 kit (for research use only) will be used to assess if the vaccination combinations induce a T cell response in study subjects. The kit uses the T-SPOT technology platform, a commercialized, standardized ELISPOT platform, which allows for the reproducible measurement of T cells reactive to SARS-CoV-2. Testing for an immune response using T cells may offer several advantages over conventional antibody testing due to the limitations reported with antibody testing. Of particular importance is that T cells have been shown to be long lived, whereas antibodies can wane over time. This could give an added importance to longer-term T cell testing well after initial infection. The T-SPOT Discovery SARS-CoV-2 test has also demonstrated in previous studies that a high SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell response may be associated with protection from infection. Dr. Peter Wrighton-Smith, CEO of Oxford Immunotec said, “We are proud to be partnering with the Oxford Vaccine Group on this critical clinical trial.
