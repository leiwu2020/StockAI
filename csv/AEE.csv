company,1615216302,Understanding Ameren's Ex-Dividend Date,66489796,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,AEE,Yahoo,"On February 12, 2021, Ameren (NYSE:AEE) declared a dividend payable on March 31, 2021 to its shareholders. Ameren also announced that shareholders on the company's books on or before March 10, 2021 are entitled to the dividend. The stock will then go ex-dividend 1 business day(s) before the record date. Ameren has an ex-dividend date planned for March 9, 2021. The company's current dividend payout sits at $0.55. That equates to a dividend yield of 3.03% at current price levels. What Is An Ex-Dividend Date? Ex-dividend dates are when company shares stop trading with their current dividend payouts in preparation for those companies to announce new ones. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Most ex-dividend dates operate on a quarterly basis. Understanding Ameren's Dividend Payouts And Yields Over the past year, Ameren has seen its dividend payouts and yields climb upward overall. Last year (March 10, 2020), the company's payout sat at $0.49, which has since increased by $0.06. Ameren's dividend yield last year was 2.31%, which has since grown by 0.72%. Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market. To read more news on Ameren click here.

Here is Benzinga's look at Ameren's Q4 earnings report. Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue Analysts covering Ameren modeled for quarterly EPS of $0.42 on revenue of $1.40 billion. In the same quarter last year, Ameren reported earnings per share of $0.38 on sales of $1.32 billion. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates""; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise"", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. View more earnings on AEE If the company were to match the consensus estimate when it reports Thursday, earnings would be up 10.53%. Revenue would be up 6.38% from the same quarter last year. Here is how the company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past: Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 EPS Estimate 1.47 0.87 0.71 0.31 EPS Actual 1.47 0.98 0.59 0.38 Revenue Estimate 1.69 B 1.44 B 1.61 B 1.64 B Revenue Actual 1.63 B 1.40 B 1.44 B 1.32 B Stock Performance Shares of Ameren were trading at $72.57 as of February 16. Over the last 52-week period, shares are down 15.5%. Given that these returns are generally negative, long-term shareholders are probably unhappy going into this earnings release. Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call. Ameren is scheduled to hold the call at 10:00:00 ET and can be accessed here.
