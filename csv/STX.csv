Mosley added, ""We are excited by the positive momentum we are seeing globally and leveraging the agility of our manufacturing operations to address the rapidly changing demand environment."" (See Seagate Technology stock analysis on TipRanks)



Following the guidance announcement, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kevin Cassidy reiterated a Buy rating on the stock but increased his price target to $110.00 from $95.00. This implies a 9.1% upside potential.



Cassidy said, “Following management's upward revision to the June quarter guidance and CFO Gianluca Romano's comments around increasing prices and utilization, we are convinced that Seagate is well-positioned to grow revenue, expand gross margin and profitability over the next several quarters. Importantly, Seagate's board of directors has targeted over 70% of free cash flow as capital returns.”



The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 9 Buys, 7 Holds, and 2 Sells. The Seagate average analyst price target of $89.78 implies 11% downside potential from current levels. Shares have gained 83.9% over the past year.

Other featured articles discuss how to invest in tomorrow's big tech trends, what a green economy could mean for miners and fashion changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, see the prospects for a hard-drive maker, a retail investing boom play, the leading electric vehicle maker and more. Cover story ""Imagining the Next 100 Years in Business, Science, and Investing"" by Lauren R. Rublin offers commentary from investment experts on the near and distant future, from synthetic biology to space travel to cryptocurrencies. For instance, see whether they believe that Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ: COIN) is in it for the long haul. Andrew Bary's ""How the Green Economy Will Be a Gold Mine for Copper"" makes a case that the push toward renewable energy will boost demand for copper, which in turn will push up prices in an already tight market. See why Barron's believes that electric vehicles alone will be a bonanza for miners such as Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE: FCX). In ""Seagate Remakes Itself for the Cloud,"" Eric J. Savitz discusses how, for 40 years, hard-drive maker Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ: STX) has faced doubt from investors. Discover why, thanks to the cloud, the data storage company is once again defying the skeptics, as new enterprise applications are powering a hard-drive renaissance. Big cultural changes usually bring big fashion changes, and the past year's COVID-19 pandemic certainly has done so, according to ""Get Dressed for the Reopening. These Stocks Will Benefit"" by Teresa Rivas. Find out why those big changes are great news for fashion retailers in the United States, including the likes of Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE). In Avi Salzman's ""Go Green With This Niche Play on Renewable Energy,"" discover how Maryland real estate investment trust Hannon Armstrong Sustnbl Infrstr Cap Inc (NYSE: HASI) brings crucial expertise and funds to support clean-energy projects.

The article presents some catalysts that could light a fire under the stock again. In ""6 Agricultural Stocks Poised to Ride Food Prices Higher,"" Al Root reveals how prices of corn, wheat and other agricultural commodities have been soaring, yet some agricultural stocks, like FMC Corp (NYSE: FMC), have not been keeping pace. Barron's suggests that that has created a buying opportunity in Deere & Company (NYSE: DE) and other stocks. Lauren R.

Its shares saw a sharp boost on the heels of its strong quarterly earnings release on April 22, with it up 9% since then. This provider of electronic data storage technology and solutions has many factors working in its favor. Demand remains strong for data storage, earnings results have beaten estimates, and guidance remains in line with analyst expectations. That being said, with prices around $90 per share, Seagate may be topping out, at least in the near-term. Its valuation looks reasonable on an absolute basis. Yet, given the cyclical nature of the industry, combined with the company’s slower-than-average top-line growth, its current forward P/E ratio may fully reflect its underlying value. Shares will likely hold on to the lion’s share of their recent gains, but the stock is unlikely to break into triple-digit price levels anytime soon. Seagate Technology And Recent Results For the fiscal quarter ending Apr 2, 2021, Seagate delivered results that were ahead of expectations. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.48, above the sell-side consensus estimate of $1.30. Revenue for the quarter also came in above projections, albeit only slightly. This news has helped to give STX a continued boost, although when the numbers initially hit the Street, the markets had a mixed reaction. The quarterly results were positive, but investors were cautious due to the company’s lukewarm guidance for the upcoming quarter. Projected sales for the next quarter are now around $2.85 billion. This is in line with analyst estimates of around $2.86 billion in revenue for the quarter ending July 2, 2021. Earnings projections for Seagate’s fiscal 4Q, at $1.45-$1.75, are also in line with analyst numbers, which are at $1.55. This may be sufficient to sustain the stock at around $90 per share. But this, coupled with other factors, may signal that the stock is about to cool off. (See Seagate Technology stock analysis on TipRanks) Short-Term Gains Could Be Limited Demand is strong for Seagate’s data storage solutions, shares pay a relatively high dividend (forward yield of around 3%), and its valuation is more than moderate. Even so, these positives are unlikely to lead to dramatically higher prices for STX stock. While Seagate's valuation is reasonable, its current P/E multiple is in line with peers in this more cyclical segment of the overall chip space. Seagate's largest segment, HDD (hard disc drive), has not been growing in the market overall. Its other main segment, Enterprise Data Solutions, SSD, and Other, is growing, but represents only 9% of its revenues. Therefore, Seagate has minimal potential for multiple expansion. What Analysts Are Saying About STX Stock According to TipRanks’ analyst rating consensus, STX stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 18 analyst ratings, there have been 11 Buys, 6 Holds and 2 Sells published. As for price targets, the average analyst price target on STX stock today is $87.42 per share, implying around 3.52% downside potential from today’s prices. Bottom Line Investors looking for a stock to buy and hold for several years may find this interesting. For those with a shorter time horizon, the opportunity for big gains may be limited. Despite its recent strong run, don’t expect STX stock to rise much higher than today’s price levels over the next few months.

Seagate Technology’s (STX) CEO, Dave Mosley said, “Seagate delivered another quarter of strong financial performance driven by ongoing operational execution and record sales of our high capacity nearline drives. We grew revenue, expanded profitability and achieved non-GAAP EPS above our guided range. Our March quarter results underscore the strength of our HDD [hard disk drive] product portfolio and increasing demand for mass capacity storage.” STX has declared a fiscal 3Q cash dividend of $0.67 per share which will be payable on July 7 to shareholders of record as on May 12. STX expects that the rising demand for its mass data storage solutions and HDD products could result in a “solid” year-on-year growth in revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter. The company expects revenues of $2.85 billion in 4Q that could rise or fall by around $150 million and anticipates non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.60 that could increase or decrease by 15 cents. (See Seagate Technology stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the third-quarter earnings, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh raised the price target from $78 to $83 and reiterated a Hold on the stock. Rakesh said in a research note, “STX noted revenue in the MarQ was driven by Cloud strength and recovery in enterprise. As we highlighted post our Inspur call, STX noted 18TB [terabytes] is ramping well and is expected to grow sequentially every quarter through 2021; we estimate it could reach ~40-50% of mass-capacity shipments by C3Q21.” Overall, consensus among Wall Street analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 11 Buys, 3 Holds, and 2 Sells. The average analyst price target of $82.19 implies downside potential of about 2.3% to current levels.
