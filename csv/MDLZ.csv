The company, which sells snack food and beverage products, plans to fund the deal with existing cash and new debt issuance. Chipita produces and markets savory and sweet snacks. The company’s portfolio of croissant and baked snack brands includes 7Days, Chipicao and Fineti. It generated revenues of approximately $580 million in 2020. The transaction is subject to certain closing purchase price adjustments, relevant antitrust approvals and closing conditions. The deal is in line with the Mondelez’s strategy to expand into the fast-growing snacking business to meet the surge in demand in this segment. The acquisition will add a new category of snacks to Mondelez’s bakery portfolio. Furthermore, the deal will expand Mondelez’s geographic reach. It will enhance the company’s distribution capabilities in the Central and Eastern European markets, significantly expanding its presence in those fast-growing markets. The company expects the buyout to be immediately accretive to its earnings per share from the time of closure of the deal. Mondelez International CEO Dirk Van de Put said about Chipita, “Their iconic brands and significant scale across so many attractive geographies make them a strong strategic complement to our existing portfolio and future growth ambitions in Europe and beyond.” (See Mondelez International stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the acquisition announcement, Jefferies analyst Robert Dickerson reiterated a Buy rating and a price target of $68 for a 6.9% upside potential. Dickerson said, “Given Chipita’s products are produced in 13 manufacturing plants and sold in over 50 countries, the acquisition broadens MDLZ’s reach not only within the broader baked-snacks category (and its Choco-bakery lines) but also provides leverageable manufacturing capacity and distribution reach such that material revenue synergies across the broader MDLZ and Chipita portfolios should develop over time, all while evident cost synergies and enhanced scalability benefits should improve profitability quickly.” He further said, “We estimate acquisition multiples near 3.5x 2020 revenues and ~20x EBITDA, but again 2020 was more a trough year, according to MDLZ, and these estimates are pre-synergies, both cost and revenue.” Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 10 Buys and 1 Hold. The average analyst price target stands at $68.27 and implies upside potential of 7.3% to current levels. Shares have gained almost 26.4% over the past year. TipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 100% Bullish on Mondelez, compared to a sector average of 69%.

Volume and pricing drove Organic Net Revenue growth, partially offset by unfavorable mix.Gross profit increased $515 million, while gross profit margin increased 450 basis points to 41.0 percent, primarily driven by favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains/losses from currency and commodity derivatives. Adjusted Gross Profit1 increased $134 million at constant currency, while Adjusted Gross Profit margin remained flat at 39.6 percent due to higher raw material costs and unfavorable product mix, offset by higher pricing and manufacturing productivity.Operating income increased $427 million and operating income margin was 17.7 percent, up 490 basis points primarily due to favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains/losses from currency and commodity derivatives and higher Adjusted Operating Income1, partially offset by higher restructuring expenses. Adjusted Operating Income increased $142 million at constant currency, and Adjusted Operating Income margin increased 140 basis points to 17.9 percent primarily driven by lower overhead costs, partially offset by increased advertising and consumer promotions spend.Diluted EPS was $0.68, up 33.3 percent, primarily due to mark-to-market gains from derivatives versus losses in the prior year, lapping the prior-year loss on interest rate swaps and an increase in Adjusted EPS, partially offset by a loss on debt extinguishment, higher Simplify to Grow program costs and lapping the prior-year gain on equity method investment transactions.Adjusted EPS was $0.77, up 10.6 percent on a constant-currency basis driven by operating gains and share repurchases, partially offset by lower equity method investment earnings and higher taxes primarily due to changes in the company's mix of earnings.Capital Return: The company returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in cash dividends and share repurchases. 2021 OutlookMondelēz International provides its outlook on a non-GAAP basis, as the company cannot predict some elements that are included in reported GAAP results, including the impact of foreign exchange.

However, management believes that also presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of the company’s historical operating results and trends in its underlying operating results, and provides additional transparency on how the company evaluates its business. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the company’s performance. The company also believes that presenting these measures allows investors to view its performance using the same measures that the company uses in evaluating its financial and business performance and trends. The company considers quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of its ongoing financial and business performance and trends. The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition & divestiture activities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results. See below for a description of adjustments to the company’s U.S. GAAP financial measures included herein. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, the company’s non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. DEFINITIONS OF THE COMPANY’S NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThe company’s non-GAAP financial measures and corresponding metrics reflect how the company evaluates its operating results currently and provide improved comparability of operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When these definitions change, the company provides the updated definitions and presents the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis. When items no longer impact the company’s current or future presentation of non-GAAP operating results, the company removes these items from its non-GAAP definitions. “Organic Net Revenue” is defined as net revenues excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and currency rate fluctuations. The company also evaluates Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and developed markets.“Adjusted Gross Profit” is defined as gross profit excluding the impacts of the Simplify to Grow Program; acquisition integration costs; the operating results of divestitures; and mark-to-market impacts from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts. The company also presents “Adjusted Gross Profit margin,” which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Gross Profit. The company also evaluates growth in the company’s Adjusted Gross Profit on a constant currency basis.“Adjusted Operating Income” and “Adjusted Segment Operating Income” are defined as operating income (or segment operating income) excluding the impacts of the items listed in the Adjusted Gross Profit definition as well as gains or losses (including non-cash impairment charges) on goodwill and intangible assets; divestiture or acquisition gains or losses and related divestiture, acquisition and integration costs; costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction; remeasurement of net monetary position; impacts from resolution of tax matters; CEO transition remuneration; Swiss tax reform impacts; and impact from pension participation changes. The company also presents “Adjusted Operating Income margin” and “Adjusted Segment Operating Income margin,” which are subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Segment Operating Income. The company also evaluates growth in the company’s Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Segment Operating Income on a constant currency basis.“Adjusted EPS” is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations excluding the impacts of the items listed in the Adjusted Operating Income definition, as well as losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses; gains or losses on equity method investment transactions; net earnings from divestitures; gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans; and U.S. and Swiss tax reform impacts. Similarly, within Adjusted EPS, the company’s equity method investment net earnings exclude its proportionate share of its investees’ significant operating and non-operating items. The tax impact of each of the items excluded from the company’s GAAP results was computed based on the facts and tax assumptions associated with each item, and such impacts have also been excluded from Adjusted EPS. The company also evaluates growth in the company’s Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis.“Free Cash Flow” is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow is the company’s primary measure used to monitor its cash flow performance. See the attached schedules for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures referred to above to the most comparable GAAP financial measures for the three months and year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. See Items Impacting Comparability of Operating Results below for more information about the items referenced in these definitions that specifically impacted the company’s results. SEGMENT OPERATING INCOMEThe company uses segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. The company believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses), amortization of intangibles, gains and losses on divestitures and acquisition-related costs (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses) in all periods presented. The company excludes these items from segment operating income in order to provide better transparency of its segment operating results. Furthermore, the company centrally manages benefit plan non-service income and interest and other expense, net. Accordingly, the company does not present these items by segment because they are excluded from the segment profitability measure that management reviews. ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY OF OPERATING RESULTSThe following information is provided to give qualitative and quantitative information related to items impacting comparability of operating results. The company identifies these based on how management views the company’s business; makes financial, operating and planning decisions; and evaluates the company’s ongoing performance. In addition, the company discloses the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on the company’s financial results in order to reflect results on a constant currency basis. Divestitures, Divestiture-related costs and Gains/(losses) on divestituresDivestitures include completed sales of businesses (including the partial or full sale of an equity method investment - discussed separately below under the gains and losses on equity method investment transactions section) and exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement. As the company records its share of KDP and JDE Peet’s ongoing earnings on a one-quarter lag basis, any KDP or JDE Peet’s ownership reductions are reflected as divestitures within the company's non-GAAP results the following quarter. The company's non-GAAP results include the impacts from last-year's partial sales of its equity method investments in KDP and JDE Peet’s as if the sales occurred at the beginning of all periods presented. See the section on gains/losses on equity method transactions below for more information. Acquisitions, Acquisition-related costs and Acquisition integration costsOn April 1, 2021, the company acquired Gourmet Food Holdings Pty Ltd, a leading Australian food company in the premium biscuit and cracker category. The company incurred acquisition-related costs of $1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021. On March 25, 2021, the company acquired a majority interest in Lion/Gemstone Topco Ltd (""Grenade""), a performance nutrition leader in the United Kingdom. The acquisition of Grenade expands the company's position into the premium nutrition market. The company incurred acquisition-related costs of $2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021. On January 4, 2021, the company acquired the remaining 93% of equity of Hu Master Holdings, a category leader in premium chocolate in the United States, which provides a strategic complement to the company's snacking portfolio in North America through growth opportunities in chocolate and other categories in the well-being segment. As a result of acquiring the remaining equity interest, the company consolidated the operation and recorded a pre-tax gain of $9 million ($7 million after-tax) related to stepping up the company's previously-held $8 million (7%) investment to fair value. The acquisition added incremental net revenues of $8 million and an operating loss of $6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021. The company also incurred acquisition-related costs of $4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021. On April 1, 2020, the company acquired a majority interest in Give & Go, a North American leader in fully-finished sweet baked goods and owner of the famous two-bite® brand of brownies and the Create-A-Treat® brand, known for cookie and gingerbread house decorating kits. The acquisition of Give & Go provides access to the in-store bakery channel and expands the company's position in broader snacking. The acquisition added incremental net revenues of $106 million and operating income of $6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021. The company incurred $1 million of acquisition-integrations costs in the three months ended March 31, 2021.The company also incurred acquisition-related costs of $5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020. Simplify to Grow ProgramThe primary objective of the Simplify to Grow Program is to reduce the company’s operating cost structure in both its supply chain and overhead costs. The program covers severance as well as asset disposals and other manufacturing and procurement-related one-time costs. Restructuring costsThe company recorded restructuring charges of $88 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and $15 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020 within asset impairment and exit costs and benefit plan non-service income. These charges were for severance and related costs, non-cash asset write-downs (including accelerated depreciation and asset impairments) and other adjustments, including any gains on sale of restructuring program assets. Implementation costsImplementation costs primarily relate to reorganizing the company’s operations and facilities in connection with its supply chain reinvention program and other identified productivity and cost saving initiatives. The costs include incremental expenses related to the closure of facilities, costs to terminate certain contracts and the simplification of the company’s information systems. The company recorded implementation costs of $34 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and $43 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020. Mark-to-market impacts from commodity and currency derivative contractsThe company excludes unrealized gains and losses (mark-to-market impacts) from outstanding commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives from its non-GAAP earnings measures until such time that the related exposures impact its operating results. The company recorded net unrealized gains on commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives of $117 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and recorded net unrealized losses of $184 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020. Remeasurement of net monetary positionDuring the second quarter of 2018, primarily based on published estimates which indicated that Argentina's three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100%, the company concluded that Argentina became a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes. As of July 1, 2018, the company began to apply highly inflationary accounting for its Argentinian subsidiaries and changed their functional currency from the Argentinian peso to the U.S. dollar. On July 1, 2018, both monetary and non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Argentinian pesos were remeasured into U.S. dollars. As of each subsequent balance sheet date, Argentinian peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date, with remeasurement and other transaction gains and losses recorded in net earnings. Within selling, general and administrative expenses, the company recorded remeasurement losses of $5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and $2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020 related to the revaluation of the Argentinian peso denominated net monetary position over these periods. Impact from pension participation changesThe impact from pension participation changes represent the charges incurred when employee groups are withdrawn from multiemployer pension plans and other changes in employee group pension plan participation. The company excludes these charges from its non-GAAP results because those amounts do not reflect the company’s ongoing pension obligations. On July 11, 2019, the company received an undiscounted withdrawal liability assessment related to the company's complete withdrawal from the Bakery and Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund totaling $526 million and requiring pro-rata monthly payments over 20 years. The company began making monthly payments during the third quarter of 2019. The company recorded $3 million of accreted interest in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and $3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020 on the long-term liability within interest and other expense, net. As of March 31, 2021, the remaining discounted withdrawal liability was $372 million, with $14 million recorded in other current liabilities and $358 million recorded in long-term other liabilities. Loss on debt extinguishment and related expensesOn March 31, 2021, the company completed an early redemption of Euro (€1,200 million) and U.S. dollar ($992 million) denominated notes. The company recorded $137 million of extinguishment loss and debt-related expenses within interest and other expense, net related to $110 million paid in excess of carrying value of the debt and recognizing unamortized discounts and deferred financing in earnings and $27 million foreign currency derivative loss related to the redemption payment at the time of the debt extinguishment. Loss related to interest rate swapsWithin interest and other expense, net, the company recognized a loss related to forward-starting interest rate swaps of $79 million ($103 million pre-tax) for the three months ended March 31, 2020 due to the changes in related forecasted debt. Gains and losses on equity method investment transactionsKeurig Dr Pepper Transactions:On March 4, 2020, the company participated in a secondary offering of KDP shares and sold approximately 6.8 million shares, which reduced its ownership interest by 0.5% of total outstanding shares. The company received $185 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $71 million (or $54 million after-tax) during the three months ended March 31, 2020. On August 3, 2020, the company sold approximately 14.1 million shares of KDP, which reduced its ownership interest by 1.0% of the total outstanding shares. The company received $414 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $181 million (or $139 million after-tax) during the third quarter of 2020. On September 9, 2020, the company sold approximately 12.5 million shares of KDP, which reduced its ownership interest by 0.9% of the total outstanding shares. The company received $363 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $154 million (or $119 million after-tax) during the third quarter of 2020. On November 17, 2020, the company participated in a secondary offering of KDP shares and sold approximately 40.0 million shares, which reduced the company's ownership interest by 2.8% of the total outstanding shares. The company received $1,132 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $459 million (or $350 million after-tax) during the fourth quarter of 2020. The company considers these ownership reductions partial divestitures of its equity method investment in KDP. Therefore, the company has removed the equity method investment net earnings related to this divested portion from its non-GAAP financial results for Adjusted EPS for all historical periods presented to facilitate comparison of results. The company's U.S. GAAP results, which include its equity method investment net earnings from KDP, did not change from what was previously reported. JDE Peet’s Transaction:In May 2020, JDE Peet’s B.V. (renamed JDE Peet’s N.V. immediately prior to Settlement (as defined below), “JDE Peet’s”) consummated the offering, listing and trading of its ordinary shares on Euronext Amsterdam, a regulated market operated by Euronext Amsterdam N.V. (the “admission”). In connection with this transaction, JDE Peet’s and the selling shareholders, including the company, agreed to sell at a price of €31.50 per ordinary share a total of approximately 82.1 million ordinary shares, including ordinary shares subject to an over-allotment option. The ordinary shares were listed and first traded on May 29, 2020, and payment for, and delivery of, the ordinary shares sold in the offering (excluding ordinary shares subject to the over-allotment option) took place on June 2, 2020 (“Settlement”). Prior to Settlement, the company exchanged its 26.4% ownership interest in JDE for a 26.5% equity interest in JDE Peet’s. The company did not invest new capital in connection with the transaction and the exchange was accounted for as a change in interest transaction. Upon Settlement, the company sold approximately 9.7 million of its ordinary shares in JDE Peet’s in the offering for gross proceeds of €304 million ($343 million). The company subsequently sold approximately 1.4 million additional shares and received gross proceeds of €46 million ($51 million) upon exercise of the over-allotment option. Following Settlement and the exercise of the over-allotment option, the company held a 22.9% equity interest in JDE Peet’s. During the second quarter of 2020, the company recorded a preliminary gain of $121 million, net of $33 million released from accumulated other comprehensive losses, and incurred $48 million of transaction costs. The company also incurred a $261 million tax expense that is payable in 2020 and 2021. During the third quarter of 2020, the company increased its preliminary gain by $10 million to $131 million. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the company recorded a $7 million loss related to a minor dilution of its ownership percentage and reduced its tax expense by $11 million to $250 million. In connection with this transaction, during the second quarter of 2020, the company changed its accounting principle to reflect its share of JDE’s historical and JDE Peet’s ongoing earnings on a one-quarter lag basis, although the company continues to record dividends when cash is received. The company determined a lag was preferable as it enables the company to continue to report its quarterly and annual results on a timely basis, while recording its share of JDE Peet’s ongoing results after JDE Peet’s has publicly reported its results. This change in accounting principle was applied retrospectively to all periods. In addition, the company considers the 3.6% ownership reduction a partial divestiture of its equity method investment in JDE Peet's. Therefore, the company has removed the equity method investment net earnings related to this divested portion from its non-GAAP financial results for Adjusted EPS for all historical periods presented to facilitate comparison of results. The company's U.S. GAAP results, which include its equity method investment net earnings from JDE Peet's, did not change from what was previously reported. Equity method investee itemsWithin Adjusted EPS, the company’s equity method investment net earnings exclude its proportionate share of its equity method investees’ significant operating and non-operating items, such as acquisition and divestiture-related costs and restructuring program costs. Constant currencyManagement evaluates the operating performance of the company and its international subsidiaries on a constant currency basis. The company determines its constant currency operating results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate the company’s financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period. OUTLOOKThe company’s outlook for 2021 Organic Net Revenue growth, Adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis and Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or otherwise adjust for items impacting comparability of financial results such as the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, restructuring activities, acquisitions and divestitures. The company is not able to reconcile its projected Organic Net Revenue growth to its projected reported net revenue growth for the full-year 2021 because the company is unable to predict during this period the impact from potential acquisitions or divestitures, as well as the impact of currency translation due to the unpredictability of future changes in currency exchange rates, which could be material as a significant portion of the company’s operations are outside the U.S. The company is not able to reconcile its projected Adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis to its projected reported diluted EPS growth for the full-year 2021 because the company is unable to predict during this period the timing of its restructuring program costs, mark-to-market impacts from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts and impacts from potential acquisitions or divestitures as well as the impact of currency translation due to the unpredictability of future changes in currency exchange rates, which could be material as a significant portion of the company’s operations are outside the U.S. The company is not able to reconcile its projected Free Cash Flow to its projected net cash from operating activities for the full-year 2021 because the company is unable to predict during this period the timing and amount of capital expenditures impacting cash flow. Therefore, because of the uncertainty and variability of the nature and amount of future adjustments, which could be significant, the company is unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures without unreasonable effort.

(Nasdaq: MDLZ), a global leader in snacking, and Olam Food Ingredients (OFI), a leading supplier of cocoa beans and cocoa ingredients, have today announced a new collaboration in Indonesia to create the world’s single largest sustainable commercial cocoa farm. The model builds on Mondelēz International’s experience with the company’s signature sustainable sourcing program, Cocoa Life, and OFI’s ambition for sustainable cocoa, Cocoa Compass, to test a scalable approach for the future of commercial cocoa farming. From sensors in fields to irrigation systems, the project will use advanced climate smart and plant science technology – rarely used to grow cocoa at this scale – as innovations included in this 2,000-hectare cocoa farm on Seram, the largest island in Maluku province in Indonesia. The model tests a modernised and professional blueprint for best practice cocoa farming, optimal land usage and farming community planning which will be explored as a potential model for replication across the region. Demand for cocoa is growing across Asia, which is set to become the second largest consuming region of cocoa ingredients in the world. Indonesia is a key cocoa-producing country in the region, but farmers have struggled with rising temperatures, low yields and crop disease. Combining their respective expertise in cocoa growing research and development, sustainable cocoa farm management, and good agricultural practices, Mondelēz International and OFI will tackle these problems by improving the livelihoods of partner cocoa farmers, empowering communities and restoring the environmental productivity of a previously deforested landscape.The partnership aims to deliver: The creation of 700 jobs for local residents in an area which has limited income opportunities due to its isolated location. Nearly half of these employment opportunities will go to women.2,000 hectares of previously deforested brown field land, which will be planted with cocoa, shade trees, forest and fruit trees to promote biodiversity and carbon capture. More than 1,080 hectares have already been planted across the total plantation area of 3,380 hectares.An area of 47 hectares which has been identified as High Conservation Value forest and is being fully protected as a vital habitat for flora and fauna.A seedling nursery which can grow up to one million high-yielding cocoa seedlings each year.Access to healthcare and education for all employees and their families, as well as housing, electricity, water, day care for the 200 families who live on site. Quentin Roach, SVP Supply Chain & Chief Procurement Officer, Mondelēz International comments: “As one of the world’s leading chocolate makers, we’re on a mission to make cocoa right and to secure a sustainable future for an ingredient essential to our business. With nine years of measurable impact demonstrating improved farmer’s livelihoods and reduced environmental impact of cocoa farming through our signature sustainable sourcing program, Cocoa Life, we’re excited to leverage our know-how in a collaborative approach to sustainable raw material sourcing with a geographically customized solution. Creating opportunities to innovate, in partnership with our suppliers, and exploring the ability to scale high-yielding, forest-positive, income-generating approaches to commercial cocoa farming on the single largest farm of its kind offers attractive potential and is an important step forward on our journey to lead the future of a sustainable and resilient cocoa supply. This initiative sits alongside Mondelēz International’s existing Cocoa Life program in Indonesia and our cocoa crop science technical center in Pasuruan, established to support sustainable cocoa farming practices and drive positive change for farmers and communities in the region.” Gerard A. Manley, CEO of OFI’s Cocoa Business, comments: “This could be truly game-changing for the future of cocoa in Indonesia and beyond. We would like to thank the regional and national governments of Indonesia for their support. Ever since we launched our first sustainability program in the country more than 16 years ago, we have been committed to supporting Indonesian cocoa farmers while also protecting the environment. We reaffirmed this commitment through our acquisition in 2019 of the country’s largest cocoa processor, BT Cocoa, to connect the full supply chain from cocoa beans to cocoa ingredients. We’re now combining our expertise and knowledge with Mondelēz International, a steward of some of the world’s most iconic snack and chocolate brands. Having just announced the achievement of our 2020 sustainability goals, we believe this partnership is a further significant step towards our Cocoa Compass ambition to have a positive impact on the future of cocoa.” Notes to editors This release should be read in conjunction with the SGX announcement issued by Olam International Ltd. entitled “Joint venture with Mondelēz International, Inc.” About Mondelēz International Mondelēz International, Inc.

Shares of the snack food and beverage products provider rose 1.3% to close at $58.84 on March 22. The deal broadens Mondelez’s (MDLZ) exposure to the snacking and fast-growing well-being segments. Furthermore, it provides a strong platform to explore the attractive high-protein and performance-nutrition segments. Grenade, a leader in high-protein bars, has been growing the presence of its Carb Killa product across the UK, North America and Asia Pacific. Carb Killa has been the best-selling product in its segment since 2016. As per Mondelez’s plans, Grenade will be operated separately to keep the authenticity of the brand intact, while the company will provide resources, support, and international scale to augment growth. Mondelez CEO Dirk Van de Put said, “Grenade’s great-tasting, on-trend products are a great platform for Mondelēz International in the UK market and beyond. This is another exciting opportunity to deliver on our strategy to be a global leader in broader snacking, including in the important area of well-being.” (See Mondelez stock analysis on TipRanks) On Feb. 16, Goldman Sachs analyst Jason English maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $69 (17.3% upside potential) on the stock. English noted, “that the company reiterated its FY21 outlook while also focusing on illustrating plans to sustain top-tier sales growth across its snacking portfolio.” The analyst said, “The company’s plans for expansion across geographies, across product segments and up and down price tiers appears more holistic and nuanced than in the past and lends more credibility to its growth ambitions.” Shares have rallied 40.3% over the past year, while Wall Street analysts are still bullish about the stock. The Strong Buy consensus rating boasts 7 Buy ratings versus 1 Hold rating. Looking ahead, the average analyst price target stands at $65.86, putting the upside potential at about 12% over the next 12 months. TipRanks’ Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool shows that confidence in Mondelez is currently Very Positive as 15 hedge funds increased their cumulative holdings of the stock by 1.1 million shares in the last quarter.
