Net income per diluted share for the quarter increased from the first quarter of 2020 due to higher gains on property sales and lower losses on debt extinguishment.FFO, as defined by Nareit, was $0.38 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2021, compared to $0.28 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2020. The increased FFO, as defined by Nareit, was primarily driven by lower losses on debt extinguishment as well as improved occupancy, rental rate growth and new developments being placed into service and leased up.Core FFO was $0.39 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2021, compared to $0.33 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2020. The increased Core FFO per diluted share was primarily driven by improved occupancy, lower bad debt expense, rental rate growth and new developments being placed into service and leased up. Key indicators of the company's operating performance were as follows: The company's stabilized in-service portfolio was 98.1 percent leased at March 31, 2021 compared to 98.1 percent leased at December 31, 2020 and 97.2 percent leased at March 31, 2020.The company's total in-service portfolio was 97.6 percent leased at March 31, 2021 compared to 97.5 percent leased at December 31, 2020 and 96.5 percent leased at March 31, 2020.The company's total portfolio, including properties under development, was 95.5 percent leased at March 31, 2021 compared to 96.0 percent leased at December 31, 2020 and 94.3 percent leased at March 31, 2020.Tenant retention was 85.0 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 94.1 percent after considering immediate backfills.Same-property net operating income growth was 6.3 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Same-property net operating income growth was primarily due to increased occupancy, rental rate growth and the expiration of free rent periods.Total leasing activity was 7.4 million square feet for the quarter.Overall cash and annualized net effective rent growth on new and renewal leases was 11.4 percent and 26.2 percent, respectively, for the quarter.The company has collected 99.9 percent of first quarter and April rents. There is only $52,000 remaining to be collected under deferral agreements. Capital transactions included: Eleven new development projects with expected costs of $412 million, which were 60 percent pre-leased, started during the quarter;Property acquisitions totaling $51 million for the quarter;Property dispositions totaling $94 million for the quarter;Issuance of $450 million of unsecured notes, which are the company's second green bond issuance, bearing interest at 1.75 percent and maturing in February 2031;Renewal of the company's $1.2 billion revolving credit facility with a revised maturity date of March 2025, an interest rate of LIBOR plus .775 percent with a reduction in borrowing costs if certain sustainability-linked metrics are achieved each year; andIssuance of 723,000 shares during the quarter, generating $30 million of net proceeds, under the company's ATM program at an average price of $41.70 per share. Real Estate Investment Activity “We started $412 million of new developments during the quarter, which were 60 percent pre-leased,"" said Mr. Connor. ""Our $1.4 billion of developments under construction are 65 percent leased and the projects remaining to be leased are primarily located in coastal infill markets. As indicated in our revised guidance, we expect development to continue at a strong pace throughout 2021. Two 50 percent-owned unconsolidated joint ventures, which had significant undeveloped land holdings in Indianapolis, were substantially liquidated during the first quarter. Nearly all of the undeveloped land in these joint ventures was distributed to our partner and 88 percent of our current undeveloped land is located in coastal infill markets at the end of the first quarter."" Development The first quarter included the following development activity: Consolidated Properties The company started eleven development projects, with expected costs of $412 million, totaling 3.8 million square feet. These development starts included two, 100 percent leased projects in Chicago totaling 1.8 million square feet; a 100 percent leased, 318,000 square foot project in Atlanta; a 100 percent leased, 112,000 square foot project in Central Florida; a 501,000 square foot, speculative project in South Florida; a 347,000 square foot, speculative project in Northern California; a 300,000 square foot, speculative project in Chicago; a 239,000 square foot speculative project in Atlanta and three speculative projects in Southern California totaling 163,000 square feet.Two projects, totaling 873,000 square feet, were placed in service during the first quarter that included a 100 percent leased project in Atlanta and a speculative project in Northern California. Acquisitions Building acquisitions totaled $51 million in the first quarter and included the following properties: A 102,000 square foot, 100 percent leased property in Northern New Jersey;An 82,000 square foot, 100 percent leased property in Southern California; andA 496,000 square foot, 100 percent leased property in Indianapolis that was received as a distribution from a 50 percent-owned unconsolidated joint venture. Building Dispositions Building dispositions totaled $94 million in the first quarter and included the following: Consolidated Properties Two 100 percent leased projects in Houston totaling 978,000 square feet. Unconsolidated Joint Venture Properties Two 100 percent leased projects in Indianapolis, totaling 298,000 square feet, that were distributed to the company's partner in two 50 percent-owned joint ventures. Distributions Declared The company's board of directors declared a quarterly cash distribution on its common stock of $0.255 per share, or $1.02 per share on an annualized basis. The first quarter dividend will be payable on June 1, 2021 to shareholders of record on May 14, 2021. 2021 Earnings Guidance A reconciliation of the company's guidance for diluted net income per common share to FFO, as defined by Nareit, and to Core FFO is included in the financial tables to this release. The company issued revised guidance for net income of $1.86 to $2.24 per diluted share, compared to the initial range of $1.24 to $1.58 per diluted share. The company issued revised guidance for FFO, as defined by Nareit, of $1.60 to $1.70 per diluted share, compared to the initial range of $1.58 to $1.68 per diluted share. ""As the result of our strong start to 2021, we have revised our guidance in several areas,"" said Mr. Connor. ""Our 2021 guidance for Core FFO has been revised to $1.65 to $1.71 per diluted share, compared to the initial range of $1.62 to $1.68 per diluted share. This represents an impressive 10.5 percent growth rate at the midpoint. Our guidance for growth in Adjusted Funds from Operations (""AFFO""), on a share adjusted basis, has been revised to between 8.0 percent and 12.3 percent, compared to the initial range of 5.8 percent to 10.1 percent. We expect this high single to even double digit percentage growth to continue for the foreseeable future as long as current overall economic conditions continue. Underpinning our expectations of strong operational results, we have revised our guidance for the average percentage leased of our stabilized portfolio to a range of 97.2 percent to 98.6 percent, compared to the initial range of 96.6 percent to 98.6 percent, and revised our guidance for the average percentage leased of our total in-service portfolio to a range of 96.3 percent to 97.7 percent, compared to the initial range of 95.7 percent to 97.7 percent. These factors, along with strong rental rate growth on recently executed leases, resulted in revised guidance for growth in same-property net operating income (cash basis) to between 4.1 percent and 4.9 percent, compared to the previous range of 3.6 percent to 4.4 percent. We also increased our guidance for same-property net operating income (net effective basis) to between 3.1 percent and 3.9 percent, compared to the previous range of between 2.5 percent and 3.3 percent. Our guidance for dispositions of properties has been revised to between $900 million and $1.10 billion, compared to the initial range of $500 million to $700 million. We have begun to market our entire St. Louis portfolio along with some other selected Midwestern assets. Additionally, we have begun marketing a few Midwestern assets leased to Amazon for outright sale, while certain assets leased to Amazon in other non-coastal Tier 1 markets may be either sold outright or contributed to a joint venture. We expect our planned 2021 disposition activity to be weighted toward the middle of the year and have increased our planned dispositions as a means to take advantage of strong pricing and to fund our development pipeline. Our guidance for 2021 development starts has been revised to between $950 million and $1.15 billion, compared to the initial range of $700 million to $900 million, with a continuing target to maintain the pipeline at a healthy level of pre-leasing. We have increased our guidance for development starts based on leasing success to date thus far and our expectation of continuing to lease up speculative space as well as our solid pipeline of build-to-suit prospects."" Other guidance changes are as follows: Acquisitions of properties in a range of $300 million to $500 million, concentrated on coastal in-fill markets, compared to the initial range of between $200 million and $400 million.General and administrative expenses ranging from $57 million to $61 million, compared to the initial range of between $55 million and $59 million. More specific assumptions and components of the company's 2021 guidance will be available by 6 p.m. Eastern Time today through the Investor Relations section of the company's website. FFO and AFFO Reporting Definitions FFO: FFO is a non-GAAP performance measure computed in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit""). It is calculated as net income attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP""), excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses on sales of real estate assets (including real estate assets incidental to our business), gains and losses from change in control, impairment charges related to real estate assets (including real estate assets incidental to our business) and similar adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures and partially owned consolidated entities, all net of related taxes. We believe FFO to be most directly comparable to net income attributable to common shareholders as defined by GAAP. FFO does not represent a measure of liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions to shareholders. Core FFO: Core FFO is computed as FFO adjusted for certain items that can create significant earnings volatility and do not directly relate to our core business operations. The adjustments include gains or losses on debt transactions, gains or losses from involuntary conversion from weather events or natural disasters, promote income, severance and other charges related to major overhead restructuring activities and the expense impact of costs attributable to successful leasing activities. Although our calculation of Core FFO differs from Nareit’s definition of FFO and may not be comparable to that of other REITs and real estate companies, we believe it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance. AFFO: AFFO is defined by the company as the Core FFO (as defined above), less recurring building improvements and total second generation capital expenditures (the leasing of vacant space that had previously been under lease by the company is referred to as second generation lease activity) related to leases commencing during the reporting period, and adjusted for certain non-cash items including straight line rental income and expense, non-cash components of interest expense including interest rate hedge amortization, stock compensation expense and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Same-Property PerformanceThe company includes same-property net operating income growth as a property-level supplemental measure of performance. The company utilizes same-property net operating income growth as a supplemental measure to evaluate property-level performance, and jointly-controlled properties are included at the company's ownership percentage. A reconciliation of income from continuing operations before income taxes to same-property net operating income is included in the financial tables to this release. A description of the properties that are excluded from the company’s same-property net operating income measure is included on page 15 of its March 31, 2021 supplemental information.

The amended and restated credit facility matures March 2025 and allows two six-month extensions and includes an uncommitted incremental facility, which allows the credit facility to be increased by up to $800,000,000. Borrowings under the amended and restated facility will bear interest at the annual rate of LIBOR plus 0.775 percent (subject to a pricing grid for changes in the company’s credit rating) compared to a rate of LIBOR plus 0.875 percent (subject to a pricing grid for changes in the company’s credit rating) under its previous facility. As part of the Company’s commitment to corporate responsibility, the credit facility also includes an incremental reduction in borrowing costs if certain sustainability linked metrics are achieved each year. Thirteen banks, all of whom were existing lenders, participated in the amended and restated facility. “This facility provides ample liquidity to our already strong balance sheet as we continue to grow our logistics real estate portfolio,” said Mark Denien, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “We are pleased to lower our borrowing costs by 10 basis points from our prior facility. As a leader in green industrial project developments and corporate responsibility, we are also proud to incorporate a sustainability component to this credit facility. Lastly, we received strong support from our incumbent banks and would like to thank them for their continued credit commitments to Duke Realty.” JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC were the Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Book Runners, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Administrative Agent, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as Syndication Agent.

company,1611781620,Duke Realty Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Results,66416565,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,DRE,Yahoo,"Development Pipeline in Excess of $1 Billion and 67 Percent Pre-Leased 27.3 Percent Growth in Net Effective Rents on Quarterly Leasing Activity Strong Rent Collections and Record Occupancy Level 2021 Guidance Issued INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 27, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Duke Realty Corporation (NYSE: DRE), the largest domestic-only logistics REIT, today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. ""We closed 2020 with excellent fourth quarter operating results, completing a year in which we experienced a global pandemic and a recession, yet we were still able to outperform our initial, pre-pandemic, 2020 guidance in all key operating and financial metrics,"" said Jim Connor, chairman and chief executive officer. ""We had an excellent quarter from a leasing standpoint, with total leasing volume of 9.7 million square feet, which is our second highest quarter ever and finished 2020 with our total portfolio 96.0 percent leased, which is the highest level ever for our total portfolio. ""We executed 3.8 million square feet of renewal leases and either renewed or immediately re-leased 85 percent of our fourth quarter lease expirations. Rental rate growth on second generation leases signed during the quarter was very strong, at 27.3 percent on a net effective basis and 12.9 percent on a cash basis. We anticipate strong rental rate growth in the markets in which we operate to continue. ""Monthly rent collections have continued at the same strong pace that has been maintained throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected 99.9 percent of fourth quarter rents and collected or executed deferral agreements for 99.9 percent of all 2020 rents. Additionally, we have collected all amounts due under rent deferral agreements through the end of 2020. We recorded a nominal amount of bad debt expense during the fourth quarter and $5.7 million for the full year, which was well below our initial expectations at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic."" ""We concluded 2020 in a solid balance sheet position to finance our continued growth using a variety of capital sources,"" stated Mark Denien, executive vice president and chief financial officer. ""Early this month we issued $450 million of 1.75 percent unsecured notes that mature on February 1, 2031, which is our second green bond issuance. We utilized the proceeds of this issuance to repay the $295 million in outstanding borrowings on our line of credit at December 31, 2020 as well as to fund eligible green projects and ongoing growth."" Quarterly Highlights A complete reconciliation, in dollars and per share amounts, of net income to funds from operations (""FFO""), as defined by NAREIT, as well as to Core FFO, is included in the financial tables included in this release. Net income was $0.45 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $0.23 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2019. Net income per diluted share for the quarter increased compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 due to higher gains on property sales. Net income for the full year 2020 was $0.80 per diluted share compared to $1.18 per diluted share for the full year 2019. Net income per diluted share for the full year 2020 decreased compared to 2019 as the result of higher gains on property sales during 2019 and higher losses on debt extinguishment recognized during 2020.FFO, as defined by NAREIT, was $0.40 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $0.34 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2019. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, was $1.40 per diluted share for the full year 2020 compared to $1.40 per diluted share for the full year 2019. Core FFO was $0.41 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $0.38 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2019. Core FFO was $1.52 per diluted share for the full year 2020 compared to $1.44 per diluted share for the full year 2019. The increased Core FFO per diluted share, for both the fourth quarter and full year 2020, was primarily driven by improved occupancy, rental rate growth and new developments being placed into service and leased up.Key indicators of the company's operating performance were as follows: The company's stabilized in-service portfolio was 98.1 percent leased at December 31, 2020 compared to 97.5 percent leased at September 30, 2020 and 97.8 percent leased at December 31, 2019.The company's total in-service portfolio was 97.5 percent leased at December 31, 2020 compared to 97.1 percent leased at September 30, 2020 and 96.6 percent leased at December 31, 2019.The company's total portfolio, including properties under development, was 96.0 percent leased at December 31, 2020 compared to 95.6 percent leased at September 30, 2020 and 94.3 percent leased at December 31, 2019.Tenant retention was 79.9 percent and 69.5 percent, respectively, for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2020 and 84.8 percent and 82.9 percent, respectively, after considering immediate backfills.Same-property net operating income growth was 3.3 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively, for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. Same-property net operating income growth over the comparable periods in 2019 was primarily due to increased occupancy and rental rate growth.Total leasing activity was 9.7 million square feet for the quarter and 28.7 million square feet for the year.Overall cash and annualized net effective rent growth on new and renewal leases was 12.9 percent and 27.3 percent, respectively, for the quarter and 13.8 percent and 28.8 percent, respectively, for the year.The company collected 99.9 percent of fourth quarter rents and 99.6 percent of January 2021 rents thus far. Capital transactions included: Eight new development projects with expected costs of $420 million that were 69 percent pre-leased, resulting in $796 million of development starts for the full year;Property acquisitions totaling $299 million for the quarter and $411 million for the year;Property dispositions totaling $276 million for the quarter and $322 million for the year;Issuance of 1.7 million shares during the quarter, generating $66 million of net proceeds, under the company's ATM program at an average price of $39.57 per share. Real Estate Investment Activity “We had an excellent quarter of growth through acquisition and development, which included the acquisition of a high quality, 1.6 million square foot, three-building portfolio in Seattle immediately adjacent to one of our existing developments,"" said Mr. Connor. ""We financed a portion of our acquisitions and developments during the fourth quarter through asset dispositions, highlighted by selling a one million square foot project leased to Amazon in Houston and two under-leased assets in Northeast Atlanta and the Western Lehigh Valley, which generated solid investment returns and where we have no remaining development land. ""Our $420 million of development starts during the quarter included three new speculative projects in Southern California. We finished the quarter with a 7.4 million square foot development pipeline totaling $1.1 billion in expected costs, which was 67 percent leased. Our development starts for the year exceeded the mid-point of our original, pre-COVID-19, 2020 guidance. ""Looking forward to 2021, we continue to be poised for significant growth when considering our highly pre-leased development pipeline, strong prospect list for new build-to-suit developments and the expected value creation from our land holdings, 78 percent of which is located in in-fill coastal markets."" Development The fourth quarter included the following development activity: Consolidated Properties The company started seven development projects, with expected costs of $363 million, totaling 2.0 million square feet. These development starts included a 100 percent leased, 146,000 square foot project in Southern California; a 100 percent leased, 141,000 square foot project in Northern California; a 517,000 square foot 100 percent leased project in Columbus; a 432,000 square foot 100 percent leased project in Dallas and three speculative projects in Southern California totaling 795,000 square feet.Two projects, totaling 1.7 million square feet, were placed in service. Both projects were 100 percent leased and included a 921,000 square foot project in Northern New Jersey and a 806,000 square foot project in Houston. Unconsolidated Joint Venture Properties A 100 percent leased, 517,000 square foot, project in Indianapolis was started by a 50 percent owned unconsolidated joint venture.A 358,000 square foot build-to-suit project in Columbus was placed in service by a 50 percent owned unconsolidated joint venture. Acquisitions Building acquisitions totaled $299 million in the fourth quarter and included the following properties: A three-building, 69 percent leased, portfolio in Seattle totaling 1.6 million square feet; andTwo projects in Southern California, totaling 297,000 square feet, which were both 100 percent leased. Building Dispositions Building dispositions totaled $276 million in the fourth quarter and included the following: Consolidated Properties A one million square foot, 100 percent leased, project in Houston;Two 100 percent leased projects in Indianapolis, totaling 1.1 million square feet;An 832,000 square foot, 53 percent leased, project in Eastern Pennsylvania; andA 590,000 square foot speculatively developed project in Atlanta. Distributions Declared The company's board of directors declared a quarterly cash distribution on its common stock of $0.255 per share, or $1.02 per share on an annualized basis. The fourth quarter dividend will be payable on February 26, 2021 to shareholders of record on February 16, 2021. 2021 Earnings Guidance A reconciliation of the company's guidance for diluted net income per common share to FFO, as defined by NAREIT, and to Core FFO is included in the financial tables to this release. The company issued guidance for net income of $1.24 to $1.58 per diluted share. The company issued guidance for FFO, as defined by NAREIT, of $1.58 to $1.68 per diluted share. ""We are introducing 2021 guidance for Core FFO of $1.62 to $1.68 per diluted share, with the midpoint of $1.65 representing an 8.6 percent increase over 2020 results,"" said Mr. Connor. ""Our guidance for growth in AFFO (""Adjusted Funds from Operations""), on a share adjusted basis, is between 5.8 percent and 10.1 percent. ""Our 2021 guidance includes the impact of some tenants, concentrated in event planning and other industries that have been most acutely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, terminating in early 2021. Any impact from these tenants on straight line rental income has already been reserved in 2020, and we are in active discussions to backfill most of these spaces, but the termination of these tenants will have a slight near-term drag on occupancy. Our range of guidance for average percent leased of our stabilized portfolio, including the impact of these tenants, is expected to decrease from current near-record levels to between 96.6 percent and 98.6 percent. ""Our guidance for same-property NOI growth, on a cash basis, is between 3.6 percent and 4.4 percent. Same-property NOI for 2021 is largely driven by an expected continuation of rental rate growth, partially offset by a slight decrease in occupancy. ""Our guidance for dispositions of properties is between $500 million and $700 million. Dispositions are expected to largely be assets identified to manage our concentration in individual tenants as well as some Midwestern assets. ""Our guidance for 2021 development starts is between $700 million and $900 million with a continuing target to maintain the pipeline at a healthy level of preleasing. Our pipeline of build-to-suit prospects continues to remain robust and the $800 million midpoint of our 2021 guidance is consistent with our actual development starts for 2020."" Ranges for the other key assumptions underlying this guidance are as follows: Acquisitions of properties in a range of $200 million to $400 million, concentrated on in-fill coastal marketsGeneral and administrative expenses ranging from $55 million to $59 million More specific assumptions and components of the company's 2021 guidance will be available by 6 p.m. Eastern Time today through the Investor Relations section of the company's website. FFO and AFFO Reporting Definitions FFO: FFO is a non-GAAP performance measure computed in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). It is calculated as net income attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP""), excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses on sales of real estate assets (including real estate assets incidental to our business), gains and losses from change in control, impairment charges related to real estate assets (including real estate assets incidental to our business) and similar adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures and partially owned consolidated entities, all net of related taxes. We believe FFO to be most directly comparable to net income attributable to common shareholders as defined by GAAP. FFO does not represent a measure of liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions to shareholders. Core FFO: Core FFO is computed as FFO adjusted for certain items that are generally non-cash in nature and that can create significant earnings volatility and do not directly relate to our core business operations. The adjustments include gains or losses on debt transactions, gains or losses from involuntary conversion from weather events or natural disasters, promote income, severance and other charges related to major overhead restructuring activities and the expense impact of costs attributable to successful leasing activities. Although our calculation of Core FFO differs from NAREIT’s definition of FFO and may not be comparable to that of other REITs and real estate companies, we believe it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance. AFFO: AFFO is defined by the company as the Core FFO (as defined above), less recurring building improvements and total second generation capital expenditures (the leasing of vacant space that had previously been under lease by the company is referred to as second generation lease activity) related to leases commencing during the reporting period, and adjusted for certain non-cash items including straight line rental income and expense, non-cash components of interest expense including interest rate hedge amortization, stock compensation expense and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Same-Property PerformanceThe company includes same-property net operating income growth as a property-level supplemental measure of performance. The company utilizes same-property net operating income growth as a supplemental measure to evaluate property-level performance, and jointly-controlled properties are included at the company's ownership percentage. A reconciliation of income from continuing operations before income taxes to same-property net operating income is included in the financial tables to this release. A description of the properties that are excluded from the company’s same-property net operating income measure is included on page 18 of its December 31, 2020 supplemental information.
