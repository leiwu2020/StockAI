Assurant is a global provider of lifestyle and housing solutions, including mobile device solutions; extended service contracts; vehicle protection services; pre-funded funeral insurance; renters insurance; lender-placed insurance products; and other specialty products.



The acquisition of Olivar should strengthen Assurant's footprint in the Asia Pacific region as a provider of mobile device life cycle management solutions. In the recent past, the company has completed a series of strategic acquisitions aimed at strengthening the global asset deposition services.



Last year, the company acquired Australia's Alegre, a leading specialist in mobile phones and tablet refurbishment. It also acquired HYLA Mobile, a leading provider of smartphone software and upgrade services.



""With these recent acquisitions, we are well-positioned to support South Korea and the broader Asia Pacific region in our Lifestyle businesses, and they reaffirm our commitment to accelerate growth in the market,"" said Keith Meier, International Assurant’s President. (See Assurant stock chart on TipRanks)



Recently, Morgan Stanley analyst Michael Philips reiterated a Buy rating on the stock but raised his price target to $188 from $172, implying 17.00% upside potential to current levels.



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 4 Buys. The average analyst Assurant price target of $190.75 implies 18.7% upside potential to current levels.



AIZ scores 7 out of 10 on TipRanks' Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

company,1613661144,Ex-Dividend Date Insight: Assurant,66280318,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,AIZ,Yahoo,"On January 12, 2021, Assurant (NYSE:AIZ) declared a dividend payable on March 15, 2021 to its shareholders. Assurant also announced that shareholders on the company's books on or before February 22, 2021 are entitled to the dividend. The stock will then go ex-dividend 1 business day(s) before the record date. Assurant, whose current dividend payout is $0.66, has an ex-dividend date set at February 19, 2021. The payout equates to a dividend yield of 1.92% at current price levels. The Significance Of An Ex-Dividend Date Ex-dividend dates are when company shares stop trading with their current dividend payouts in preparation for those companies to announce new ones. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Most ex-dividend dates operate on a quarterly basis. Assurant's Dividend History Over the past year, Assurant has seen its dividend payouts and yields climb upward overall. Last year (February 21, 2020), the company's payout sat at $0.63, which has since increased by $0.03. Assurant's dividend yield last year was 1.9%, which has since grown by 0.02%. Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market. To read more news on Assurant click here.
