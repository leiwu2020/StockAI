However, the processed and packaged foods manufacturer was able to surpass the Street’s expectations.



Quarterly adjusted earnings came in at $0.54 per share, which surpassed expectations of $0.52 per share. It compares unfavorably with $0.75 per share reported in the last year’s quarter.



Conagra reported revenues of $2.74 billion and surpassed consensus estimates of $2.71 billion. (See Conagra stock chart on TipRanks)



Meanwhile, the company's board of directors have authorised a 14% hike to annualized dividend rate, beginning with the dividend payable on September 2, 2021.



President and CEO of Conagra Sean Connolly said, “The underlying strength of our business and our continued investments to further support our brands give me confidence that we have a long runway of growth and shareholder value creation ahead of us.”



For fiscal 2022, Conagra expects net sales to remain flat. Also, adjusted operating margin is anticipated to be around 16%. Adjusted EPS is expected to be nearly $2.50.



Following the earnings results announcement, Jefferies analyst Robert Dickerson reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $40 (17.7% upside potential).



The analyst said, “With investors expecting a guide-down, valuation low, the dividend raised, and 2H earnings still in line with prior company expectations, there could be some support for the stock on a down day today.”



Overall, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus based on 2 Buys and 3 Holds. The average Conagra price target of $39.40 implies 16% upside potential from current levels.

Despite being founded as a joke and having no central purpose when it was created, Dogecoin continues to gain attention. Source: Shutterstock Recently, Elon Musk and other prominent celebrities have urged followers to take a look at Dogecoin. As a result of all this publicity, DOGE keeps on rising. It traded for under a penny per coin not that long ago. Now, it’s at more than seven cents each. For people that bought close to the 52-week lows, DOGE is up more than 1,000%. While the price action is certainly encouraging, however, it’s still hard to see a fundamental reason to own it. Purely as an investment, Dogecoin is lacking in merit. However, since people generally own it for the memetic value, perhaps fundamentals don’t matter. So, can continued publicity and momentum keep DOGE rising for now?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Dogecoin Fervor Continues To Spread It’d be easy to dismiss the recent buzz around Dogecoin as just being due to Elon Musk’s charisma. Musk has been one of the most prominent DOGE boosters in recent weeks. However, Dogecoin excitement has also reached fairly unlikely places. 10 Stocks to Buy for Your $5K Robinhood Portfolio For example, consider Conagra (NYSE:CAG), which is a packaged foods company. Conagra is known for things such as Hunt’s tomato sauce, Reddi-Wip and Vlasic pickles. A cutting-edge company, Conagra is not. Yet, Conagra recently used Dogecoin for its marketing. In its latest conference call, Conagra highlighted the benefits of using Dogecoin for promotion of its Slim Jim meat sticks: “As an example, the Slim Jim community online was built on memes. Given that fact, Doge and Dogecoin were a natural fit for our brand. Since joining the online conversation about the do-good-everyday sentiment of Dogecoin, we’ve tapped into another channel for Slim Jim to engage with its community. We’ve seen a market uptick in audience interaction, including direct engagement and advocacy from the person that created Dogecoin as you can see on this slide.” The numbers don’t lie. When a company like Conagra can get massive engagement for meat snacks, of all things, using Dogecoin, you know you have a phenomenon on your hands. Dogecoin has certainly captured the cultural zeitgeist. Still Hard To Put Together An Investment Case Our Alex Sirois recently outlined why Dogecoin’s price will never hit $10, even though optimists are throwing out that figure as a price target. For one thing, there’s still not much of an actual use case for Dogecoin. The project was created as a joke. One of Dogecoin’s developers now even feels regret seeing it turn into what he sees as a vehicle for pump and dump trading as opposed to just being something fun. Yes, there are some actual places to spend Doge now, such as for Dallas Mavericks basketball game tickets. However, Mark Cuban, the team’s owner, appears to be accepting Doge as a stunt rather than as any long-term statement about Dogecoin’s potential value. At $10 per coin, Dogecoin would have a market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion. Currently, just four American companies are worth that much. Even Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), the clear #2 in crypto, is worth just $250 billion now. The idea that Dogecoin is going to surpass that figure several times over seems utterly ridiculous. The fact that DOGE is soaring on these sorts of wild price targets speaks to the general speculative mood. It’s hard to value Dogecoin on any sort of economic basis since the project wasn’t designed to do much other than be a fun diversion. Dogecoin has succeeded beyond anyone’s wildest dreams on that front. Dogecoin Verdict I love Dogecoin as a meme. It’s a great deal of fun, and the positive upbeat vibe is nice. It certainly stands out from the much more jaded communities you find around a lot of other altcoins. That said, it’s unclear what value, if any, Dogecoin has in the long-term. It doesn’t really have any functional uses besides celebrities and companies embracing it as a clever marketing gimmick. Perhaps there is some way to create value out of that for DOGE at some point. But it’s not like Dogecoin was ever intended to be some serious disruptive financial technology. Enjoy the memes, and if you want to trade a little, I couldn’t blame you. Don’t mistake DOGE, however, for being a credible long-term investment.

Yeah, that’s not a string of words I ever expected to see together, either, but here we are. Source: Shutterstock So why exactly are these terms being searched together this morning. Why are Dogecoin investors interested in Slim Jim. Let’s dive into it below. The biggest news is that Slim Jim parent company Conagra (NYSE:CAG) is releasing a stick of beef based on the meme icon. This new product is set to come out on Tuesday, which is the unofficial Doge Day holiday. Plans for the Dogecoin Slim Jim were announced back in March after enough Retweets pushed the company to create the product. All of this makes sense as Slim Jim has been one of the first brands to embrace the meme cryptocurrency. Conagra CEO Sean Connolly even gave the crypto a call out during the company’s earnings report last week. He noted that the Slim Jim social media account embracing Dogecoin resulted in increased interaction during the quarter. This marks the first time that a brand has built a business strategy around DOGE or included in it an earnings call. Slim Jim embracing Dogecoin is clear to see on its Twitter account. The description for it reads as such “Home of the #LongBoiGang ? such meat • very long boi • much wow • 2021 Adweek Reigning Champions ? (YOU DID THIS!).” Of course, there’s also loads of appreciation from the #Dogearmy for Slim Jim with today’s news.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What a great day to be a part of the #doge community AND the #slimjim gang.

Adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 came in ahead of consensus estimates of $0.58 per share while revenues increased 8.5% year-on-year to $2.8 billion, beating consensus estimates of $2.72 billion. Conagra Brands’ (CAG) President and CEO, Sean Connolly said, “We have made significant investments in our business over the past five-plus years, modernizing our products to generate consumer demand. Our strong third-quarter results benefited from these investments. We continued to invest in the business during the quarter, with a focus on ensuring our products are available both online and in stores, as we aim to maximize consumer acquisition during this period of heightened demand.” The company’s grocery and snacks segment and refrigerated and frozen business saw year-on-year growth of 10.8% and 11.7% in the third quarter, respectively. Conagra bought back 8.8 million shares for $298 million. The company also provided guidance for the fourth quarter and expects organic net sales to decline by 10% to 12% year-on-year while adjusted operating margin is expected to be between 14% to 15%. Conagra foresees adjusted EPS to land between $0.49 to $0.55. The company also completed the divestiture of its Peter Pan peanut butter business in 3Q which is expected to reduce annual net sales by around $110 million and adjusted EPS by $0.03. (See Conagra Brands stock analysis on TipRanks) The company also reaffirmed guidance for FY22 and expects adjusted EPS of $2.63 to $2.73. Following the results, Jeffries analyst Robert Dickerson reiterated a Buy and a price target of $40 on the stock. Dickerson said in a note to investors, “CAG Q3 EPS of $0.59, slightly ahead of cons. $0.58, driven by below-the-line items. Org. sales growth beat (+9.7% vs. +7.3%), although gross and op. margins missed, albeit at the low end of mgmt’s Q3 guide.” “FY’22 guidance reaffirmed with 8.8mm shares repo’d in Q3, which could add $0.05 to FY’22 EPS. Q4 guide above cons. sales, but below on implied op. profit at margin guide midpoint, driven by cost inflation. Question now on margin progression in FY’22,” Dickerson added. Overall, the rest of the Street is sidelined on the stock with a Hold consensus rating based on 1 Buy, 1 Hold, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $37 implies that CAG shares are currently fully priced.
