(TSX:CXI) (OTCBB:CURN), a full service foreign exchange technology and services provider, today announced that it has joined the Jack Henry Banking® Vendor Integration Program (VIP). Participation in the program will provide CXI with access to Jack Henry Banking’s technical resources to enable CXI’s proprietary foreign exchange and payments software, CXIFX, to integrate with SilverLake, CIF 20/20, and Core Director. The Vendor Integration Program is designed to help ensure that Jack Henry Banking’s customers can easily deploy third-party products. CXIFX integrates with SilverLake, CIF 20/20, and Core Director via jXchange™, a services-based programming interface that enables third-party vendors and banks to access the platform’s core data and business rules. The integrity of data is maintained throughout any data exchange, because access to business rules and data is managed through a service layer which governs these interactions. CXI is developing integrations into the core banking platforms to provide financial institutions enhanced automation through an efficient end-to-end payment process supported by an experienced, foreign exchange specialist. Financial institutions have traditionally provided foreign exchange and international services through multiple bank relationships that also compete for the same business within their markets. CXI enables financial institutions to have all of their international services with one provider that does not compete for their clients and creates client-focused relationships with a suite of offerings including foreign currency banknotes, foreign check clearing, and international payments. ""CXI’s integration with Jack Henry Banking allows financial institutions to meet or surpass the expectations of today’s consumers, businesses, and international payment managers with speed and efficiency supported by a consultative, highly-personalized customer relationship. Simplifying foreign exchange with core banking integrations benefits all parties in the international payments ecosystem - financial institutions, end clients, and CXI. This makes the integration a valuable prospect to financial institutions looking to stand out with their customers, reduce payment burdens, and improve margins,"" said Randolph Pinna, Chief Executive Officer of CXI. Jack Henry Banking’s VIP takes the customer out of the middle, providing vendors with direct access to Jack Henry Banking’s technical resources and test systems. VIP inclusion is not an endorsement of the vendor’s product.

Jack Henry (JKHY) announced that the new dividend will be paid on March 25, to shareholders of record as of March 8. The technology solutions and payment processing services company’s annual dividend of $1.84 per share now reflects a dividend yield of 1.26%. Jack Henry CFO Kevin D. Williams said, “This increase in our dividend authorization evidences our continued confidence that these trends will continue and our commitment to deploy our cash to the benefit of our shareholders.” (See Jack Henry stock analysis on TipRanks) Last week, Jack Henry reported fiscal second-quarter results. The company’s 2Q non-adjusted earnings remained stable year-over-year at $0.94 per share but outpaced Street estimates of $0.87. Adjusted revenues increased 2% to $420.2 million but missed analysts’ expectations of $432.71 million. As for fiscal 2021, the company expects adjusted revenues in the range of $1.73 billion to $1.74 billion. Non-adjusted EPS is anticipated in the range of $3.85 to $3.90. On Feb. 10, Raymond James analyst John Davis trimmed the stock’s price target to $179 (24% upside potential) from $196 and maintained a Buy rating “following” the company’s “F2Q21 results that came in softer than expected on the top line, but was more than offset by a better margin, resulting in EPS upside.” “While the big picture hasn’t really changed given the reiterated revenue outlook and increased EPS guide (+$0.10), unfortunately JKHY has turned into somewhat of a show me story and patience is required as the company will likely need to print the acceleration before investors give them credit,” Davis added. The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 2 analysts suggesting a Buy and 4 analysts recommending a Hold. The average analyst price target of $171.60 implies about 19% upside potential to current levels. Related News: T.
