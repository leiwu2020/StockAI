The Offer will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on June 17, 2021, unless extended or earlier terminated by Sysco with respect to any or all series of Securities (such date and time, as the same may be extended, the “Expiration Time”). Holders must validly tender and not validly withdraw their Securities at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 3, 2021, unless extended by Sysco with respect to any or all series of Securities (such date and time, as the same may be extended with regard to any or all series of Securities, the “Early Tender Time”) in order to be eligible to receive the Full Tender Offer Consideration, which includes an early tender payment of $50 per $1,000 principal amount of Securities (the “Early Tender Payment”). Holders that validly tender their Securities after the Early Tender Time and at or prior to the Expiration Time will not be eligible to receive the Early Tender Payment and will be eligible to receive only the Full Tender Offer Consideration minus the Early Tender Payment. In each case, Holders that validly tender Securities that are accepted for purchase by Sysco will receive accrued and unpaid interest from, and including, the last interest payment date for such Securities to, but not including, the Settlement Date (as defined below) for such Securities, in each case rounded to the nearest cent (“Accrued Interest”). Securities validly tendered may be withdrawn at any time on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 3, 2021, with respect to any or all series of Securities, unless extended by Sysco, but not thereafter. The Depository Trust Company and any broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee that holds the Securities may have earlier deadlines for tendering Securities pursuant to the Offer than the Early Tender Time or the Expiration Time. The terms and conditions of the Offer are described in the offer to purchase, dated May 20, 2021 (the “Offer to Purchase”). Tendered Securities will be accepted in the order of the acceptance priority level for such series (in numerical priority order) as set forth in the table above, with 1 being the highest acceptance priority level, and based on whether the Securities are tendered at or before the Early Tender Time or after the Early Tender Time, as described in the Offer to Purchase. Notwithstanding the acceptance priority level, if any Securities are purchased in the Offer, Securities tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Time will be accepted for purchase in priority to Securities tendered after the Early Tender Time and at or prior to the Expiration Time, subject to the Tender SubCap in the case of the 5.950% Senior Notes. Accordingly, if the Total Tender Cap is reached in respect of tenders made at or prior to the Early Tender Time (excluding tenders of 5.950% Senior Notes in a principal amount in excess of the Tender SubCap), no Securities of any series tendered after the Early Tender Time (regardless of acceptance priority level) will be accepted for purchase, unless we increase the Total Tender Cap. In addition, if the Tender SubCap is reached in respect of tenders of 5.950% Senior Notes made at or prior to the Early Tender Time, no 5.950% Senior Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time will be accepted for purchase, unless we increase the Tender SubCap. Under certain circumstances, Sysco will accept tendered Securities of one or more of the series on a prorated basis as further described in the Offer to Purchase. Sysco reserves the right, but is not obligated, to increase the Total Tender Cap or the Tender SubCap. Accordingly, Holders should not tender any Securities that they do not wish to be accepted for purchase. The Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions as specified in the Offer to Purchase. Under these conditions and as more fully described in the Offer to Purchase, Sysco expressly reserves its right, but is not obligated, with respect to any or all series of Securities, to extend the Offer at any time and may amend or terminate the Offer if, before such time as any Securities have been accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offer, any condition of the Offer is not satisfied or, where applicable, waived. The Offer is not conditioned on a minimum principal amount of Securities of all series or of any one series being tendered. The “Full Tender Offer Consideration” payable for the Securities will be a price per $1,000 principal amount of the Securities equal to an amount that would reflect, as of the date of purchase, a yield to the maturity date or par call date, as applicable, of the applicable series of Securities (which is April 15, 2027 for the 7.160% Debentures, August 1, 2028 for the 6.500% Debentures, March 17, 2039 for the 6.625% Senior Notes, January 1, 2030 for the 5.950% Senior Notes, October 1, 2039 for the 6.600% Senior Notes due 2040 and October 1, 2049 for the 6.600% Senior Notes due 2050) equal to the sum of (i) the Reference Yield for the applicable series of Securities, plus (ii) the applicable Fixed Spread. The Early Tender Payment is included in the amount of Full Tender Offer Consideration.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsStatements made in this press release that look forward in time or that express management’s beliefs, expectations or hopes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward looking statements reflect the views of management at the time such statements are made and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, estimates, and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These statements include, but are not limited to: statements regarding Sysco’s growth strategy and statements regarding Sysco’s comprehensive financial outlook for periods through FY24, including planned cost reductions from FY21 through FY24, expected adjusted earnings per share in FY22, our targeted FY24 adjusted EPS, our establishment of a net leverage target, and our plans to reduce indebtedness in FY21 and FY22. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, such as general economic conditions, the effect, impact, potential duration or other implications of the COVID‑19 pandemic and any expectations we may have with respect thereto, and other risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of additional factors impacting the Company’s business, see Sysco’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2020, as filed with the SEC, Sysco’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 27, 2021, as filed with the SEC, and Sysco’s subsequent filings with the SEC. Sysco does not undertake to update its forward‑looking statements, except as required by applicable law. Sysco Corporation and its Consolidated SubsidiariesNon-GAAP Reconciliation (Unaudited)Impact of Certain ItemsSysco’s results of operations have historically been impacted by restructuring and transformational project costs consisting of: (1) restructuring charges; (2) expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives; and (3) facility closure and severance charges. Sysco’s results have also been impacted by intangible amortization expense related to the fiscal 2017 acquisition of Cucina Lux Investments Limited (the Brakes Acquisition). Additionally, the impacts of loss on the sale of businesses, fixed asset impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges and adjustments to bad debt expense related to the unexpected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted Sysco's results of operations in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020. Many of Sysco’s customers, including those in the restaurant, hospitality and education segments, are operating at a substantially reduced volume due to governmental requirements for closures or other social-distancing measures and a portion of Sysco’s customers have been closed. Some of these customers ceased paying their outstanding receivables, creating uncertainty as to their collectability. We experienced an increase in past due receivables and recognized additional bad debt charges in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020; however, collections have improved in fiscal 2021, partially from restaurant reopenings, volumes improvements and Sysco’s improved credit processes. We have estimated uncollectible amounts based on the current collection experience and by applying write-off percentages based on historical loss experience, including loss experience during times of local and regional disasters, current conditions and collection rates, and expectations regarding future losses. The COVID-19 pandemic is more widespread and longer in duration than historical disasters impacting our business, and it is possible that actual uncollectible amounts will differ and additional charges may be required; however, if collections continue to improve, it is also possible that additional reductions in our bad debt reserve could occur. While Sysco traditionally incurs bad debt expense, the magnitude of such expenses and benefits, that we have experienced is not indicative of our normal operations. Our adjusted results have not been normalized in a manner that would exclude the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. As such, Sysco has not adjusted its results for lost sales, inventory write-offs or other costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic not previously stated. The results of our foreign operations can be impacted due to changes in exchange rates applicable in converting local currencies to U.S. dollars. We measure our operating results on a constant currency basis, which is calculated by translating current-period local currency operating results with the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period. Although Sysco has a history of growth through acquisitions, the Brakes Group was significantly larger than the companies historically acquired by Sysco, with a proportionately greater impact on Sysco’s consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, Sysco is excluding from its non-GAAP financial measures for the relevant period the impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization specific to the Brakes Acquisition. We believe this approach significantly enhances the comparability of Sysco’s results. Sysco refers to the collective items above as Certain Items and although these items were experienced in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, the company may identify additional items and/or remove items from this definition in the future. Sysco has and may continue to present operating results adjusted to exclude Certain Items to provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends. Sales and EPS TargetsWe expect to achieve our sales and earnings per share targets by fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024. We cannot predict with certainty when we will achieve these results or whether the calculation of our sales and/or EPS will be on an adjusted basis in future periods to exclude the effect of Certain Items. Additionally, the results of our foreign operations can be impacted due to changes in exchange rates applicable in converting local currencies to U.S. dollars, and we may adjust our operating results for the impact of constant currency as compared to the comparable prior year period. Due to these uncertainties, we cannot provide a quantitative reconciliation of these potentially non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable effort. However, we expect to calculate these adjusted results, if applicable, in the same manner as the reconciliations provided for the historical periods that are presented herein.

Third Quarter Fiscal 2021 Results Total Sysco Sales for the third quarter were $11.8 billion, a decrease of 13.7% compared to the same period last year.

Forward-Looking Statements Statements made in this press release or in our earnings call for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 that look forward in time or that express management’s beliefs, expectations or hopes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements reflect the views of management at the time such statements are made and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, estimates, and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These statements include statements concerning: the effect, impact, potential duration or other implications of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and any expectations we may have with respect thereto, including the extent and duration of lockdowns in the U.S. and Europe; the pace of the business recovery; our expectations regarding our ability to manage the current downturn and capitalize on our position as the industry leader as the global economy recovers; our expectations regarding future market share gains; the pace of implementation of our business transformation initiatives; our belief that our strategy and our transformational initiatives will drive future value for our associates, shareholders and customers in the fourth quarter and beyond; our expectations regarding our company, and our ability to attract and serve new customers, following the COVID-19 crisis; our expectations regarding our ability to win meaningful business in the national account space; the effects of our continuing investments in digital technology; our expectations regarding the timing of the business recovery following the COVID-19 crisis; our belief that consumers are ready to eat at restaurants as soon as COVID-19 restrictions are reduced; our expectations regarding the business recovery in Europe; the impact on our results of government-imposed restrictions on restaurant operations; our expectations that our work to accelerate growth will return to pre-COVID levels as demand resurges; our expectations regarding the effect of our hiring of drivers on transportation expenses in the short term; our belief that our hiring of drivers will help ensure that Sysco is able to maximize our share gain during the upcoming business recovery; our expectations regarding our ability to become the most customer-centric foodservice distributor in the industry; our expectations regarding our ability to accelerate profitable growth; our expectations regarding future sales; our expectations regarding cost savings over the next several quarters; our expectations that our investments in technology and our business will allow for future growth and exceptional customer service; our belief that the steps undertaken as part of our management of the COVID-19 crisis to date will help us retain and win additional business from our independent restaurant customers beyond the pandemic; our expectations that we will hire over 6,000 associates in the second half of our fiscal year; our expectations of significant returns on our investments in our capability builds in service of our transformation; our expectations regarding the impact of our investments in our transformation initiatives on our results in the second half of fiscal 2021; our expectations regarding improvements in the SYGMA segment; our plans to transition away from a large existing SYGMA customer; our expectations that international will be a growth opportunity for Sysco in fiscal 2022; our plans to reinvest a portion of our cost savings into our growth agenda; our ability to deliver against our strategic priorities; statements regarding economic trends in the United States and abroad; our expected repayment of amounts under the UK Commercial Paper Program; our expectations regarding the deployment of capital proceeds that Sysco currently holds; and our expectations regarding our cash performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The success of our plans and expectations regarding our operating performance are subject to the general risks associated with our business, including the risks of interruption of supplies due to lack of long-term contracts, severe weather, crop conditions, work stoppages, intense competition, technology disruptions, dependence on large, long-term regional and national customers, inflation risks, the impact of fuel prices, adverse publicity, labor issues, political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade, any or all of which could delay our receipt of product or increase our input costs. Risks and uncertainties also include the impact and effects of public health crises, pandemics and epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the adverse impact thereof on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including, but not limited to, our growth, product costs, supply chain, labor availability, logistical capabilities, customer demand for our products and industry demand generally, consumer spending, our liquidity, the price of our securities and trading markets with respect thereto, our credit ratings, our ability to maintain compliance with the covenants in our credit agreement, our ability to access capital markets, and the global economy and financial markets generally. Risks and uncertainties also include risks impacting the economy generally, including the risks that the current general economic conditions will deteriorate, or consumer confidence in the economy or consumer spending, particularly on food-away-from-home, may decline. Market conditions may not improve. Competition and the impact of GPOs may reduce our margins and make it difficult for us to maintain our market share, growth rate and profitability. We may not be able to fully compensate for increases in fuel costs, and fuel hedging arrangements intended to contain fuel costs could result in above market fuel costs. Our ability to meet our long-term strategic objectives depends on our ability to grow gross profit, leverage our supply chain costs and reduce administrative costs. This will depend largely on the success of our various business initiatives, including efforts related to revenue management, expense management, our digital e-commerce strategy and any efforts related to restructuring or the reduction of administrative costs. There are various risks related to these efforts, including the risk that if sales from our locally managed customers do not grow at the same rate as sales from regional and national customers, or if we are unable to continue to accelerate local case growth, our gross margins may decline; the risk that we are unlikely to be able to predict inflation over the long term, and lower inflation is likely to produce lower gross profit; the risk that our efforts to mitigate increases in warehouse costs may be unsuccessful; the risk that we may not be able to accelerate and/or identify additional administrative cost savings in order to compensate for any gross profit or supply chain cost leverage challenges; the risk that these efforts may not provide the expected benefits in our anticipated time frame, if at all, and may prove costlier than expected; the risk that the actual costs of any initiatives may be greater or less than currently expected; and the risk of adverse effects to our business, results of operations and liquidity if past and future undertakings, and the associated changes to our business, do not prove to be cost effective or do not result in the cost savings and other benefits at the levels that we anticipate. Our plans related to and the timing of any initiatives are subject to change at any time based on management’s subjective evaluation of our overall business needs. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our efforts, we could become cost disadvantaged in the marketplace, and our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease. Adverse publicity about us or lack of confidence in our products could negatively impact our reputation and reduce earnings. Capital expenditures may vary based on changes in business plans and other factors, including risks related to the implementation of various initiatives, the timing and successful completion of acquisitions, construction schedules and the possibility that other cash requirements could result in delays or cancellations of capital spending. Periods of significant or prolonged inflation or deflation, either overall or in certain product categories, can have a negative impact on us and our customers, as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the food-away-from-home market, and may negatively impact our sales, gross profit, operating income and earnings, and periods of deflation can be difficult to manage effectively. Fluctuations in inflation and deflation, as well as fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies, are beyond our control and subject to broader market forces. Expanding into international markets presents unique challenges and risks, including compliance with local laws, regulations and customs and the impact of local political and economic conditions, including the impact of Brexit and the “yellow vest” protests in France against a fuel tax increase, pension reform and the French government, and such expansion efforts may not be successful. Any business that we acquire may not perform as expected, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions. Expectations regarding the financial statement impact of any acquisitions may change based on management’s subjective evaluation. A divestiture of one or more of our businesses may not provide the anticipated effects on our operations. Meeting our dividend target objectives depends on our level of earnings, available cash and the success of our various strategic initiatives. Changes in applicable tax laws or regulations and the resolution of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results. We rely on technology in our business and any cybersecurity incident, other technology disruption or delay in implementing new technology could negatively affect our business and our relationships with customers. For a discussion of additional factors impacting Sysco’s business, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 27, 2020, as filed with the SEC, and our subsequent filings with the SEC. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law.

Sysco Corporation and its Consolidated SubsidiariesNon-GAAP Reconciliation (Unaudited)Impact of Certain Items Sysco’s results of operations for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 were impacted by restructuring and transformational project costs consisting of: (1) restructuring charges; (2) expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives; and (3) facility closure and severance charges. Sysco’s results for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 were also impacted by intangible amortization expense related to the fiscal 2017 acquisition of Cucina Lux Investments Limited (the Brakes Acquisition). Additionally, our results for fiscal 2021 were impacted by loss on the sale of businesses. Fiscal 2021 results of operations were also positively impacted by the reduction of bad debt expense previously recognized in fiscal 2020 due to the unexpected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the collectability of our pre-pandemic trade receivable balances. Fiscal 2020 results of operations were also negatively impacted by costs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, the most significant of which were (1) excess bad debt expense, as we experienced an increase in past due receivables and recognized additional bad debt charges, and (2) goodwill impairment charges. Many of Sysco’s customers, including those in the restaurant, hospitality and education segments, are operating at a substantially reduced volume due to governmental requirements for closures or other social-distancing measures and a portion of Sysco’s customers have been closed. Some of these customers ceased paying their outstanding receivables, creating uncertainty as to their collectability. We experienced an increase in past due receivables and recognized additional bad debt charges in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020; however, collections have improved in fiscal 2021, partially from restaurant reopenings, volumes improvements and Sysco’s improved credit processes. We have estimated uncollectible amounts based on the current collection experience and by applying write-off percentages based on historical loss experience, including loss experience during times of local and regional disasters, current conditions and collection rates, and expectations regarding future losses. The COVID-19 pandemic is more widespread and longer in duration than historical disasters impacting our business, and it is possible that actual uncollectible amounts will differ and additional charges may be required; however, if collections continue to improve, it is also possible that additional reductions in our bad debt reserve could occur. While Sysco traditionally incurs bad debt expense, the magnitude of such expenses and benefits, that we have experienced is not indicative of our normal operations. Our adjusted results have not been normalized in a manner that would exclude the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. As such, Sysco has not adjusted its results for lost sales, inventory write-offs or other costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic not previously stated. The results of our foreign operations can be impacted due to changes in exchange rates applicable in converting local currencies to U.S. dollars. We measure our total Sysco and our International Foodservice Operations results on a constant currency basis. Constant currency operating results are calculated by translating current-period local currency operating results with the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period. The constant currency impact on our adjusted total Sysco and our adjusted International Foodservice Operations results are disclosed when the impact exceeds a defined threshold of greater than 1% on the growth metric. If the amount does not exceed this threshold, a disclosure will be made that the impact of the currency change was not significant. Management believes that adjusting its operating expenses, operating income, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these Certain Items and presenting its International Foodservice Operations results on a constant currency basis, provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that (1) is indicative of the performance of the company’s underlying operations and (2) facilitates comparisons on a year-over-year basis. Although Sysco has a history of growth through acquisitions, the Brakes Group was significantly larger than the companies historically acquired by Sysco, with a proportionately greater impact on Sysco’s consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, Sysco is excluding from its non-GAAP financial measures for the relevant period the impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization specific to the Brakes Acquisition. We believe this approach significantly enhances the comparability of Sysco’s results for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020. Set forth below is a reconciliation of sales, operating expenses, operating income, interest expense, other (income) expense, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to adjusted results for these measures for the periods presented. Individual components of diluted earnings per share may not add up to the total presented due to rounding. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings divided by diluted shares outstanding.

Sysco Corporation and its Consolidated SubsidiariesNon-GAAP Reconciliation (Unaudited)Free Cash Flow(In Thousands) Free cash flow represents net cash provided from operating activities less purchases of plant and equipment and includes proceeds from sales of plant and equipment. Sysco considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases and sales of buildings, fleet, equipment and technology, which may potentially be used to pay for, among other things, strategic uses of cash including dividend payments, share repurchases and acquisitions. However, free cash flow may not be available for discretionary expenditures, as it may be necessary that we use it to make mandatory debt service or other payments. Free cash flow should not be used as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP measure in assessing the company’s liquidity for the periods presented. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. In the table that follows, free cash flow for each period presented is reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities. 39-WeekPeriod EndedMar. 27, 2021 39-WeekPeriod EndedMar. 28, 2020 39-WeekPeriod Changein DollarsNet cash provided by operating activities (GAAP)$1,479,784 $1,078,469 $401,315 Additions to plant and equipment(251,167) (603,865) 352,698 Proceeds from sales of plant and equipment19,308 13,245 6,063 Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP)$1,247,925 $487,849 $760,076 Sysco Corporation and its Consolidated SubsidiariesNon-GAAP Reconciliation (Unaudited)Impact of Certain Items on Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA)(Dollars in Thousands) EBITDA represents net earnings (loss) plus (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax expense and benefit, (iii) depreciation and (iv) amortization. The net earnings (loss) component of our EBITDA calculation is impacted by Certain Items that we do not consider representative of our underlying performance. As a result, in the non-GAAP reconciliations below for each period presented, adjusted EBITDA is computed as EBITDA plus the impact of Certain Items, excluding Certain items related to interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Sysco's management considers growth in this metric to be a measure of overall financial performance that provides useful information to management and investors about the profitability of the business, as it facilitates comparison of performance on a consistent basis from period to period by providing a measurement of recurring factors and trends affecting our business. Additionally, it is a commonly used component metric used to inform on capital structure decisions. Adjusted EBITDA should not be used as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP measure in assessing the company’s financial performance for the periods presented. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP.

Budget conscious pricing plans allow hoteliers to differentiate their property with the Google Assistant’s contactless guest experience. The contactless smart base solution is packed with hospitality feature functionality and is available for a modest all-inclusive purchase cost per unit or billed at an affordable monthly rate per guest room. The voice command feature provides a contactless means to access guest services and amenities. The Google Nest Hub has no camera and - when provisioned to the hotel - does not record or store audio interactions. With the simple voice command ‘Hey Google’ guests can set a wakeup alarm, speak with the front desk, get a recommendation, or request an item be brought to their room. The base solution also interfaces with guests’ personal devices playing media through the Bluetooth speaker with rich audio. Weather, area attractions, dining and more are also only a ‘Hey Google’ away. Hoteliers can select additional á la carte upgraded and customizable options as well as full integrations with a wide array of industry recognized hospitality systems and applications. “Our partnership with Volara to bring Google for Hotels to our U.S. customers is an exciting step for Guest Supply,” said Sandy Romoser, President of Guest Worldwide. “Google’s contactless technology is a great enhancement to the guest experience and an efficient tool for hoteliers. Guest Supply is committed to providing a full spectrum of solutions to equip hoteliers with the right tools to build guest confidence and convenience at this critical time in our industry.” “Through Google’s partnership with Volara, the launch of Google for Hotels in 2020 has proven to be a central component of guest service at leading hotels,” noted Sarah Thomson, Global Enterprise Business Development for Devices and Services at Google. “We are excited about this new partnership between Volara and Guest Supply that will bring this innovative product to Guest Supply’s customer base. We see big opportunities for hoteliers to thrive as the industry transforms and transcends the challenges over the past year.” “Volara is thrilled to partner with Guest Supply to distribute our joint solution with Google to hoteliers across the United States,” said David Berger, CEO of Volara. “The power of Google’s leading smart display hardware - unmatched on the market for its guest privacy protections - coupled with Volara’s proven management interface, conversation models, and integrations hub - is having a demonstrable impact on hotels managing guest requirements for contactless stays during this pandemic. As we bring this solution to many more hotels through our partnership with Guest Supply, we expect it will become the standard guest room amenity at properties seeking to lead the industry in recovery.” About Guest SupplyGuest Supply is part of Guest Worldwide, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sysco Corporation. The company is a leading provider of hospitality supply products to the lodging industry for more than 40 years with more than 30,000 products sold in more than 25,000 well-known chains and independent properties around the globe.

Today, I dig into another pork-related issue, California's Proposition 12, which could have a major impact on pork supply chains and prices throughout the United States in the coming year, ultimately impacting packaged food companies. For updates on issues impacting CPG supply chains, please subscribe to The Stockout here. What is Proposition 12? Proposition 12 is an animal welfare ballot initiative that California voters passed in 2018 with 60% of the vote by ""largely urban voters,"" to use the industry's phrase. It sets minimum standards for confining farm animals (egg-laying hens, veal calves and breeding pigs) in California and prohibits the sale of products (eggs, veal meat and pork meat) in California from farm animals that were confined in a way that does not meet certain minimum standards. The portion of Proposition 12 that goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2022, and requires sows (pigs kept for the purpose of commercial breeding) to have a minimum of 24 square feet per animal and requires egg-laying hens to be housed cage-free. How has the meat industry reacted to this regulation? By challenging it in the courts (so far, unsuccessfully). The North American Meat Institute (NAMI) argued that the legislation violates interstate commerce laws because it is a California law that imposes restrictions on farmers across the United States — all farmers that intend to sell products in California are impacted. NAMI's argument was shot down by the U.S. Court of Appeals, and NAMI recently filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court asking for review. The new laws also continue to be challenged in the courts by both the National Pork Producers Council and American Farm Bureau Federation on behalf of hog farmers, who filed a lawsuit arguing that Prop 12 is unconstitutional. My perception is that the argument that the California laws overstep by influencing production practices in other states is not a winning one. We have seen similar situations in other industries, such as automotive, which has had to deal with emissions standards in California that are stricter than national standards, impacting manufacturers in other states and countries. In the past year, California outbound tender rejection rate rose from 10% to 44.8% and is currently below the U.S. reefer tender rejection rate. (Source: SONAR; the percentages of outbound tendered refrigerated loads that are being rejected by carriers in California and the U.S. as a whole are shown in white and green, respectively. For more information on SONAR or to request a demo, click here.) Is the pork industry ready for this change? No. Less than 4% of U.S. sow housing currently meets the new standard, whereas about 20% of U.S. pork would need to be compliant. Producers have been reluctant to make the investments, with Proposition 12 continuing to be challenged in courts. Will this have an immediate impact on the market on Jan. 1? Not likely. The packaged pork that is already in inventory prior to Jan. 1, 2022, does not need to be discarded or sold outside of California if the product originated from animals not raised according to the Proposition 12 confinement standards. At the end of the day on Dec. 31, 2021, the animals covered by the law will no longer be able to be ""confined in a cruel manner,"" in accordance with the new law. In short, California hogs need to have more room by New Year's Day. What impact are the new laws likely to have on the market for hogs and pork products? There could simultaneously be pork shortages and pork surpluses — shortages of compliant pork that can be sold within California and surpluses of noncompliant pork that can be sold outside California. RaboResearch estimates that compliant pork could fall 50% short of the state's needs. California accounts for about 14% of U.S. pork production but produces less than 2% of its own pork, with most of its production sent to other states or exported. Presumably, pork producers will rearrange supply chains so more pork that is produced in California is also consumed in California since pork that is either produced or sold in the state needs to meet the requirements. The tightest outbound reefer markets (highest tender rejection rates) are shown in darker blue and include much of the Upper Midwest. (Source: SONAR; the percentage of outbound tendered refrigerated loads that are being rejected by carriers are shown according to the key above. For more information on SONAR or to request a demo, click here.) Elsewhere in the world of pork, food distributor Sysco filed a price-fixing lawsuit against pork producers. Sysco accused Tyson, Smithfield (the largest pork producer), Hormel, JBS and others, which Sysco claims control 80% of the market, of a price-fixing scheme in which they shared pricing and other sensitive pieces of information in an anti-competitive manner to elevate pork prices. The lawsuit claims that this practice dated back to at least 2009. That is the latest in a number of pieces of litigation involving price-fixing claims, including a settlement between JBS and food-service companies.
