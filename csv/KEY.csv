The KeyCorp Analyst: R. Scott Siefers downgraded KeyCorp's stock from Overweight to Neutral with an unchanged $20.50 price target. The KeyCorp Thesis: Regional banks remain a ""solid"" space for investors as it offers relative value versus the broader market, Siefers wrote in the note. But in KeyCorp's case, the stock is up more than 25% since the start of 2021 and trading at a hefty valuation. KeyCorp's stock is trading at 12.1 times 2022 estimated EPS and implies it no longer trades at a ""meaningful"" discount to its peers, the analyst wrote. In fact, the discounted valuation was one of the pillars to justify buying the stock in the past. Related Link: 6 Catalysts Bank Stock Investors Should Watch In 2021 KeyCorp's stock is also trading at 152% of its tangible book value (TBV), which is ""right on top"" of other large regional peers. Despite a downgrade, KeyCorp remains well-positioned to take advantage of a favorable market and its portfolio of products allows it to differentiate itself from rivals. The bottom line, the stock no longer offers the same degree of upside potential to support a bullish rating. KEY Price Action: Shares of KeyCorp were trading higher by 2.8% Wednesday at $21.23.
