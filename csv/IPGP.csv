Scherbakov to become CEO and Valentin P. Gapontsev to transition to Executive Chairman of the Board OXFORD, Mass., May 04, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IPG Photonics Corporation (NASDAQ: IPGP) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021. In a separate press release, the Company announced CEO transition, which is effective immediately. Three Months Ended March 31, (In millions, except per share data and percentages) 2021 2020 ChangeRevenue $345.6 $249.2 39 %Gross margin 47.5 % 41.3 % Operating income $88.8 $44.8 98 %Operating margin 25.7 % 18.0 % Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation $68.1 $36.4 87 %Earnings per diluted share $1.26 $0.68 85 % Management Comments ""We were pleased to see continued strong demand in China and North America as well as a further improvement in Europe. These drove both year-over-year and sequential increases in sales, despite typical seasonality, helping us achieve our best first quarter results since 2018, which was a record year, and a solid start to 2021,"" said Dr. Valentin Gapontsev, IPG Photonics' Executive Chairman of the Board. ""We saw firm demand in welding applications, growth in electric vehicle battery production and solar cell manufacturing that helped our results. Initial orders for our handheld welder were strong and we are increasing production of this innovative device to meet growing customer demand,"" said Dr. Eugene Scherbakov, IPG Photonics’ Chief Executive Officer. Financial Highlights First quarter revenue of $346 million increased 39% year over year. Materials processing sales increased 45% year over year due to higher sales in welding, cutting, solar cell manufacturing, sintering and ablation applications. Materials processing sales accounted for 92% of total revenue in the quarter. Sales into other applications decreased 9% year over year as strength in advanced applications and telecom was offset by lower revenue in medical. Sales of high power continuous wave (""CW"") lasers, representing 49% of total revenue, increased 43% year over year. These sales benefited from growth of ultra-high power fiber lasers (6 kilowatts of power or greater), which represented 55% of all high power CW laser sales, as well as strong demand for pulsed and adjustable mode beam (AMB) lasers. By region, sales increased 104% in China, 14% in Europe, and 9% in North America on a year-over-year basis. Sales decreased 21% in Japan. Earnings per diluted share (""EPS"") of $1.26 increased 85% year over year. Foreign exchange gains benefited EPS by $0.09. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 23%. During the first quarter, IPG generated $88 million in cash from operations. Capital expenditures were $27 million and stock repurchases totaled $3 million. Business Outlook and Financial Guidance ""The broad-based economic recovery across most of our end markets supported strong bookings in the first quarter and resulted in a book-to-bill that was meaningfully above 1. I am encouraged to see strong bookings for our core high power fiber lasers used in cutting and welding applications as well as for newer emerging products in medical applications, electric vehicle battery production and solar cell manufacturing. We believe that global trends such as increasing energy efficiency and sustainability, displacement of legacy non-laser processes and growth in electric vehicle battery capacity, together with a recovery in global capital spending and improving economic conditions will continue to drive demand for our fiber lasers,"" concluded Dr. Gapontsev. For the second quarter of 2021, IPG expects revenue of $360 to $390 million. The Company expects the second quarter tax rate to be approximately 25%. IPG anticipates delivering earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.20 to $1.50, with 53.5 million basic common shares outstanding and 54.2 million diluted common shares outstanding. Financial guidance provided this quarter is subject to greater risk and uncertainty given the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated impacts to the global business environment, public health requirements and government mandates. As discussed in more detail in the ""Safe Harbor"" passage of this news release, actual results may differ from this guidance due to various factors including, but not limited to, government and Company measures implemented to address the COVID-19 pandemic, product demand, order cancellations and delays, competition, tariffs, trade policy changes and general economic conditions. This guidance is based upon current market conditions and expectations, and is subject to the risks outlined in the Company's reports with the SEC, and assumes exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar of Euro 0.85, Russian Ruble 76, Japanese Yen 111 and Chinese Yuan 6.57, respectively.

We are lucky that he will continue as Executive Chairman.” “It is hard to overstate Dr. Gapontsev’s contribution to fiber lasers and IPG, as an inventor, entrepreneur and visionary,” said John Peeler, Lead Independent Director. “This implements the succession plan discussed by the IPG Board for some time. Dr. Scherbakov is uniquely qualified for his new role.” Dr. Scherbakov has served as Managing Director of IPG Laser GmbH, IPG’s German subsidiary, since August 2000, Senior Vice President-Europe since February 2013 and Chief Operating Officer since February 2017. He has been a member of its Board of Directors since 2000.

Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, (In millions, except per share data and percentages) 2020 2019 Change 2020 2019 ChangeRevenue $336.6 $306.6 10% $1,200.7 $1,314.6 (9)%Gross margin 43.6% 40.5% 44.9% 46.1% Operating income $65.2 $0.2 32,500% $198.7 $233.8 (15)%Operating margin 19.4% 0.1% 16.5% 17.8% Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation $49.3 $(4.5) NM $159.6 $180.2 (11)%Earnings per diluted share $0.92 $(0.08) NM $2.97 $3.35 (11)% NM - Not meaningful Management Comments ""We are very pleased with our fourth quarter results as we delivered revenue that was 10% higher than the fourth quarter 2019 and was above the top end of our guidance range,"" said Dr. Valentin Gapontsev, IPG Photonics' Chief Executive Officer. ""In addition, book-to-bill was above one in the fourth quarter as we saw the traction in order flow continue from the third quarter. We are benefiting from the advantages of our leading-edge products, technology differentiation, low-cost production capabilities and global footprint. Although gross margin was reduced by 410 basis points by an additional inventory charge of $14 million, we still achieved a 310 basis point year-over-year increase in gross margin driven by an increase in revenue, product cost reductions, and product mix. Despite numerous challenges in 2020 from COVID-19, we ended the year with a strong performance and are very well positioned as we enter 2021."" Financial Highlights Fourth quarter revenue of $337 million increased 10% year over year. Materials processing, which is comprised of many different applications, accounted for 90% of total revenue, and increased 10% year over year primarily due to higher sales in cutting applications. Sales into other applications increased 12% year over year, driven by the strength in advanced applications and devices used in medical procedures. Sales of high power continuous wave (""CW"") lasers, representing 55% of total revenue, increased 17% year over year. These sales benefited from growth of ultra-high power fiber lasers (6 kilowatts of power or greater) which represented 56% of all high power CW laser sales. By region, sales increased 52% in China, and decreased 5% in Europe, 29% in Japan and 11% in North America on a year-over-year basis. During the fourth quarter, emerging product and application sales were 28% of total revenue and increased 22% year over year. Earnings per diluted share (""EPS"") of $0.92 increased by more than 100% year over year. The additional inventory charge that negatively impacted EPS was related to optical components that have been replaced by components with better performance. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 24%. During the fourth quarter, IPG generated $85 million in cash from operations and capital expenditures were $26 million. There was no stock repurchased during the quarter. Business Outlook and Financial Guidance ""Bookings growth was strong across all our key geographies, building on the improvements that started in the third quarter. We believe we are starting to benefit more meaningfully from a stronger investment cycle driven by equipment upgrades, automation, the need for flexible processing and even improved efficiency. In total, fourth quarter book-to-bill was above 1. Our total backlog was $674 million, which comprised of $376 million of orders with firm shipment dates, and $298 million of frame agreements. While total backlog decreased by 3%, this was due to a 27% decrease in frame agreements. Importantly, orders with firm shipment dates increased by 32%. In addition, order flow for frame agreements, which are primarily booked in China, has been very strong in the first weeks of the year."" ""While considerable macroeconomic uncertainty related to the pandemic remains, we are incrementally more optimistic in our outlook given the near-term trends we have seen in the last quarter. We continue to see sales improve in our core materials processing market and are excited about our ability to grow in other applications outside of cutting and welding, primarily in advanced applications, electric vehicle battery processing, micro-processing and medical. We have continued to execute admirably in these challenging times, and our strong balance sheet and free cash flow provide us ample flexibility to respond to business disruptions and maintain our leading competitive position,"" concluded Dr. Gapontsev. For the first quarter of 2021, IPG expects revenue of $310 to $340 million. The Company expects the first quarter tax rate to be approximately 25%. IPG anticipates delivering earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.90 to $1.20, with 53.2 million basic common shares outstanding and 53.9 million diluted common shares outstanding. Financial guidance provided this quarter is subject to greater risk and uncertainty given the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated impacts on the global business environment, public health requirements and government mandates. As discussed in more detail in the ""Safe Harbor"" passage of this news release, actual results may differ from this guidance due to various factors including, but not limited to, government and Company measures implemented to address the COVID-19 pandemic, product demand, order cancellations and delays, competition, tariffs, trade policy changes and general economic conditions.

Decipher the announcement with Benzinga's help. Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue IPG Photonics EPS will likely be near $0.98 while revenue will be around $310.96 million, according to analysts. IPG Photonics reported a profit of $0.91 per share when it published results during the same quarter last year. Sales in that period totaled $306.63 million. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates""; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise"", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. View more earnings on IPGP The analyst consensus estimate would represent a 7.69% increase in the company's EPS figure. Sales would be up 1.41% from the same quarter last year. Here is how the company's reported EPS has compared to analyst estimates in the past: Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 EPS Estimate 0.89 0.60 0.19 0.80 EPS Actual 1.29 0.91 0.68 0.91 Revenue Estimate 304.00 M 282.24 M 236.44 M 287.81 M Revenue Actual 318.44 M 296.41 M 249.24 M 306.63 M Stock Performance Shares of IPG Photonics were trading at $249.73 as of February 11. Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 86.21%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders should be satisfied going into this earnings release. Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call. IPG Photonics is scheduled to hold the call at 10:00:00 ET and can be accessed here.
