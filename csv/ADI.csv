Using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, let us compare two semiconductor companies that cater to automotive markets, NXP Semiconductors and Analog Devices, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.







NXP Semiconductors (NXPI)



NXP Semiconductors is a global semiconductor company that provides a wide array of semiconductor products including microcontrollers, application processors, communication processors, connectivity chipsets, analog and interface devices, RF power amplifiers, security controllers and sensors.



The company’s products target automotive, mobile, communication and infrastructure, as well as industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) markets.



In Q1, the company reported revenues of $2.6 billion, up 27% year-over-year with diluted earnings of $1.25 per share versus a loss of $0.08 per share in the same quarter last year.



For Q2, NXP expects to earn revenues of $2.57 billion at the midpoint of its revenue guidance, a jump of 41% year-over-year. The forecast for operating income at the midpoint of its range is $542 million.



Following the Q1 results, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated a Buy and raised the price target from $192 to $225 on the stock.



Rakesh said in a research note to investors, “We believe NXPI is well positioned in key growth markets as the #2 player in  Semiconductor Automotive and a strong position in 5G infrastructure. We believe LVP [light vehicle production] for 2021 looks better after a significantly weaker 2020 and are in the early innings of the 5G rollout, NXPI has a number of opportunities with ADAS [Advanced Driver Assistance Solutions] content, massive MIMO [multiple-input, multiple-output], and Power Amplifiers for 5G.”



The company was plagued by chip supply constraints in the first quarter and expects this situation to continue for the remainder of this year. Rakesh noted regarding the supply constraints, saying, “NXPI is running at the high-end of its utilization with most fabs full out and sees higher capex at 7% of revenue for the year as it adds back end capacity to cope with additional demand.”



When it comes to the Automotive segment, NXP expects to ship 20% more automotive semiconductor products in the first half of the year versus the first half of 2019. NXP noted the rising level of electric vehicle (EV) production is leading to increasing penetration of its electric drivetrains.



Importantly, the automotive market made up around 47.8% of the company’s total revenues of $2.6 billion in Q1.



The mobile market made up only 13.5% of NXP’s total revenues in Q1 with revenues of $346 million. However, it expects revenues for this segment to grow in the mid-30% range year-over-year in Q2, driven by 5G ultra-wide-band (UWB) networks.



NXP has a portfolio of UWB IoT solutions including NXP Trimension SR150 and SR040. The development tools that are based on those solutions will enable new applications for iPhone and Apple Watch. (See NXP Semiconductors stock analysis on TipRanks)



Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 14 Buys and 4 Holds. The average analyst NXPI price target of $227.33 implies approximately 11.7% upside potential to current levels.







Analog Devices (ADI)



Analog Devices designs, manufactures and tests a broad portfolio of solutions including integrated circuits (ICs) software and subsystems. The company specializes in data conversion, signal processing, and power management technology.



The company posted revenues of $1.66 billion in Q2, which surpassed the Street’s estimates of $1.61 billion and rose 26% from the year-ago period. The increase was attributed to strength in the industrial and automotive markets.



ADI reported earnings of $1.54 per share, beating the consensus estimates of $1.45 per share and soaring 43% year-over-year.



In the fiscal third quarter, ADI expects revenues of $1.7 billion that could vary by $70 million. The company forecasts earnings per share of $1.23 that could increase or decrease by $0.11 per share.



Around five days back, Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer reiterated a Buy on the stock.



Similar to NXP, ADI continues to expect supply constraints to affect the company for the rest of the year. Last week, in a virtual interaction between Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer and ADI’s Director of Investor Relations, Mike Lucarelli, Lucarelli said that supply constraints are likely to extend into early next year.



However, ADI said at its earnings call, “Despite this backdrop, we are positioned for a strong second half as our continued capital investments are aligned with robust demand.”



The company caters to industrial, communications, automotive, and consumer markets with its products. In Q3, the company expects revenues across its business-to-business (B2B) markets to rise slightly quarter-on-quarter while revenue from the consumer market is anticipated to increase in “low double digits."" (See Analog Devices stock analysis on TipRanks)



Analyst Rick Schafer expects the revenues from the Industrial market to rise over the long-term, with automation at factories and healthcare “leading a multiyear growth cycle, with these sub-segments growing >10% LT.”



The analyst also said that while the management expects revenues from the communications market in China to be flat in the second half of this year, Schafer expects that this market could show an uptick.



The analyst added, “The company remains on track to close MXIM [acquisition of Maxim] this summer. Management expects ~$3.5B in cash and net leverage <1x upon deal close. With ~$2B of excess cash post MXIM close, we believe ADI will return >100% of FCF to shareholders through buybacks and, to a lesser degree, dividends. Looking ahead, we see growth accelerating led by 5G/auto/industrial.”



Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 8 Buys and 1 Holds. The average analyst ADI price target of $179.63 implies approximately 6.6% upside potential to current levels.







Bottom Line



Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, NXP seems to be a better Buy.

Analog Devices specializes in data conversion, signal processing, and power management technology. Revenues of $1.66 billion surpassed the Street’s estimates of $1.61 billion and jumped 26% from the year-ago period. The increase was attributed to strength in the industrial and automotive markets. Earnings came in at $1.54 per share, beating the consensus estimates of $1.45 per share and soared 43% year-over-year. Analog Devices CEO Vincent Roche said, “The economic recovery has materialized faster and stronger than initially anticipated, increasing pressure across supply chains globally. Our decision to strategically invest in additional capacity ahead of this demand inflection has enabled us to move with speed and agility to better serve our customers. These investments combined with continued momentum in bookings give us confidence that our second half will be stronger than the first half.” (See Analog Devices stock analysis on TipRanks) He further added, “I am more optimistic than ever about ADI’s position in this reordered world as we create long-term value for all stakeholders.” For Q3, the company expects revenue in the range of $1.63 billion to $1.77 billion versus the consensus estimate of $1.65 million. Earnings per share are expected to land in the range of $1.50 – $1.72, versus consensus forecasts of $1.53. Following the fiscal Q2 earnings release, Robert W. Baird analyst Tristan Gerra maintained a Buy rating and increased the price target to $165 (7.8% upside potential). Gerra commented, “Analog Devices would have guided significantly higher than seasonal without the ongoing significant supply constraints, echoing constraints reflected in peers guidances including TI. Management expects lead times to remain stretched for a while, in line with our bullish thesis on the semiconductor industry, while bookings/backlog remain very strong, suggesting a C1H22 above-seasonal outlook.” Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 5 unanimous Buys. The average analyst price target stands at $183.25 and implies upside potential of 19.7% to current levels. Shares have gained 33.7% over the past year. TipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 100% Bullish on ADI, compared to a sector average of 69%.

The increase was attributed to strength in the industrial and automotive markets.Earnings came in at $1.54 per share, beating the consensus estimates of $1.45 per share and soared 43% year-over-year.Analog Devices CEO Vincent Roche said, ""The economic recovery has materialized faster and stronger than initially anticipated, increasing pressure across supply chains globally. Our decision to strategically invest in additional capacity ahead of this demand inflection has enabled us to move with speed and agility to better serve our customers. These investments combined with continued momentum in bookings give us confidence that our second half will be stronger than the first half."" (See Analog Devices stock analysis on TipRanks)He further added, “I am more optimistic than ever about ADI’s position in this reordered world as we create long-term value for all stakeholders.""For Q3, the company expects revenue in the range of $1.63 billion to $1.77 billion versus the consensus estimate of $1.65 million. Earnings per share are expected to land in the range of $1.50 - $1.72, versus consensus forecasts of $1.53.Following the fiscal Q2 earnings release, Robert W. Baird analyst Tristan Gerra maintained a Buy rating and increased the price target to $165 (7.8% upside potential).Gerra commented, “Analog Devices would have guided significantly higher than seasonal without the ongoing significant supply constraints, echoing constraints reflected in peers guidances including TI. Management expects lead times to remain stretched for a while, in line with our bullish thesis on the semiconductor industry, while bookings/backlog remain very strong, suggesting a C1H22 above-seasonal outlook.”Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 5 unanimous Buys. The average analyst price target stands at $183.25 and implies upside potential of 19.7% to current levels. Shares have gained 33.7% over the past year.TipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 100% Bullish on ADI, compared to a sector average of 69%.Related News :Take-Two Tops Expectations in Q4; Shares Pop 4%Transcat’s Q4 Results Beat Expectations; Shares DipSplunk Agrees to acquire TruSTAR, Enhance Security Solutions",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0010856ea2c89b8b0ed66401c04d979471b4a8467940f6dd65569f6e0c45b878

The BFIC will be used in MDA’s phased array antenna for the Telesat Lightspeed low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation. This constellation, which is made up of 298 satellites, has a planned launch in 2H23. It is expected to boost connectivity globally in the commercial, government, and defense markets. Analog Devices (ADI) Vice President of Aerospace and Defense, Bryan Goldstein, said, “Electronically steered array technology is a necessity for the builders and operators of the next generation of LEO constellations. This technology provides MDA and Telesat with the ability to simultaneously steer multiple beams and allows beams to be rapidly repositioned at speeds that are not possible with mechanical systems.” (See Analog Devices stock analysis on TipRanks) Amer Khouri, Vice President of Satellite Systems, MDA, commented, “We look forward to continuing this journey together and producing the large quantity of antennas required for this groundbreaking system.” LEO satellites do not have a fixed position and move across the sky. In order to maintain continuous and high-speed connectivity with terminals on the ground, these satellites need to dynamically steer communication beams. The BFIC technology is reliable and can perform under extreme temperatures and cosmic radiation over the full 10 to 12-year lifespan of each satellite. Recently, Robert W. Baird analyst Tristan Gerra reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $160 price target. Reacting to supply constraints for Analog Devices, Gerra commented, “Historically ADI has run at lower utilization rates versus peers for the very purpose of being able to respond to surges in demand while maintaining stable lead times.” The rest of the Street is also bullish on the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 14 Buys and 2 Holds. The average analyst price target of $180.13 implies an upside potential of 13% from current levels. Shares have gained about 65.7% over the past year.
