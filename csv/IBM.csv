Quarterly revenue surged 3% year-over-year to $18.7 billion, surpassing analysts' expectations of $18.29 billion. (See International Business Machines stock chart on TipRanks)



Cloud & Cognitive Software revenues rose 6.1% to $6.1 billion; revenues of Global Business Services segment totaled $4.3 billion, up 11.6%; and Global Technology Services revenues remained almost flat at $6.3 billion. Meanwhile, Systems revenues declined 7.3% to $1.7 billion, and revenues of Global Financing segment fell 8.6% to $242 million.



The Chairman and CEO of IBM, Arvind Krishna, said, “In the second quarter, client adoption of our hybrid cloud platform contributed to strong performance in Global Business Services and software and drove improved overall revenue growth. We remain on track to deliver full-year revenue growth and meet our cash flow objective.”



Last week, BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman maintained a Hold rating on the stock but raised the price target from $150 to $155 (12.4% upside potential). In anticipation of the Q2 results, the analyst said, “There is modest upside tension to consensus revenue estimates of $18.3 billion.”



Overall, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus based on 4 Buys, 3 Holds and 1 Sell. The average International Business Machines price target of $153 implies 11% upside potential. The company’s shares have gained 11.3% year-to-date.



According to TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, IBM scores a 9 out of 10, suggesting that the stock is likely to outperform market averages.

One of those companies is tech giant International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). The company is expected to release its earnings report after-market close on Monday, July 19. (See IBM stock charts on TipRanks)  



Covering the stock in his report, Amit Daryanani of Evercore ISI opined that the Q2 results should be a “solid quarter” for IBM. The five-star analyst wrote that IBM should benefit from “improved IT spending backdrop, easy year-over-year compare, and favorable setup (vs. Historical seasonality).”  



Daryanani reiterated a Hold rating on the stock, and declared a price target of $150. This suggests a potential 12-month upside of 7.99%.  



He was also highly encouraged by the switch in executive management, namely the new CEO and Chairman Arvind Krishna, who replaced Jim Whitehurst. The change is said to have brought “a new sense of optimism” to the age-old company.  



“Initiatives like open door policy and office hours where employees can discuss anything/everything with Mr. Krishna coupled with his focus on software assets has created a sense of excitement and empowerment within the organization,” wrote Daryanani.   



IBM has also spun-off a new company called Kyndryl from its IT infrastructure services branch. The future firm will be responsible for managing digital transformations for infrastructure services. Daryanani expects this new company to be highlighted throughout the earnings call.  



On TipRanks, IBM has an analyst rating consensus of Moderate Buy, based on 4 Buy and 3 Hold ratings, and 1 Sell rating. The average IBM price target is $153, reflecting a possible 12-month upside of 10.15%. IBM closed trading Friday at a price of $138.90 per share.

The financial terms of the deal, which is likely to close in the third quarter of 2021, have been kept under wraps.



Following the news, shares of the company gained marginally in Thursday’s trading session. However, it pared its gains slightly to close at $140.40 in the extended trading session.



With data analytics gaining significance daily, this buyout is expected to strengthen IBM’s foothold in the data management space and further enhance its offerings.



The Senior Vice-President of IBM Services and Global Business Services, Mark Foster, said, ""Our acquisition of Bluetab will fuel migration to the cloud and help our clients to realize even more value from their mission-critical data."" (See IBM stock chart on TipRanks)



Recently, Morgan Stanley analyst Kathryn Huberty reiterated a Hold rating on the stock with a price target of $152. The analyst’s price target implies upside potential of 8.2% from current levels.



According to the analyst, the company’s recent email outage can be a cause of concern. She noted, “This could lead to some revenue recognition being pushed out, as IBM reportedly requires contract e-signatures before midnight on the last day of the quarter to book a deal as revenue in the quarter. In addition to any impact in the June quarter, the outage raises some reputational risk for IBM Services which manages thousands of customer migrations similar to this one each year.”



The Wall Street community is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus based on 4 Buys, 3 Holds and 1 Sell. The average IBM price target of $151.75 implies the stock has upside potential of 8.1% from current levels. 



IBM scores a 9 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations. Shares have gained about 13.3% over the past year.

Over the past year, shares of the tech giant have jumped 18.2%, trading at over $140. Solid Q2 results might propel the stock price upward, so let’s take a closer look at what analysts on the Street are expecting.



Q2 Expectations



For Q2, the Street expects IBM to report adjusted EPS of $2.25 and revenues of $18.29 billion.



Meanwhile, the Earnings Whisper number, or the Street’s unofficial view on earnings, stands at $2.34 per share. (See IBM stock charts on TipRanks)



IBM did not provide any formal guidance for the upcoming quarter.



Prior Quarter Snapshot



In the last-reported first quarter, revenues came in at $17.7 billion, which increased 1% year-over-year and outpaced the Street’s estimates of $17.34 billion, boosted by its bets in the high-margin cloud computing business.



Meanwhile, adjusted earnings decreased 4% year-over-year to $1.77 per share, which surpassed the Street’s estimates of $1.63.



Factors to Note



IBM primarily generates revenues from its various segments: Cloud & Cognitive Software Segment, Global Business Services (GBS) Segment, Global Technology Services Segment, and Systems segment.



IBM’s Cloud & Cognitive Software Segment revenues grew 4% in the first quarter, led mainly by the company’s hybrid platform growth. The trend is expected to have continued in the upcoming quarter, driven by increasing digitalization.



The digital transformation by enterprises across the globe is expected to have resulted in healthy uptake of IBM’s hybrid cloud offerings, expanding Cloud & Cognitive Software Segment revenues in the about-to-be-reported quarter. In addition, contributions from the Red Hat acquisition are likely to have contributed to the Cloud & Cognitive Software segment’s revenues.



Notably, IBM has doubled down on hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence.



In the first quarter, IBM’s CEO Arvind Krishna focused on the progress made on hybrid cloud platform and AI strategy. He said that “with about 3,000 hybrid cloud platform clients, we’ve now tripled the revenue base of OpenShift since we acquired Red Hat.” That is tremendous, and the trend, if continued in the upcoming quarter, should lead to explosive cloud revenues.



Turning to the GBS segment, revenues grew 2.4% year-over-year in the prior quarter. Healthy pipelines across hybrid cloud and data platforms, and strength in Cloud Paks and Security are expected to have continued to accelerate revenue growth in the GBS segment. IBM Cloud Paks are AI-powered tools that help businesses build, upgrade, and manage apps across any cloud securely.



In Q1, systems sales increased 4.3% year over year, owing to solid performance in IBM Z, while product cycle dynamics in Power and Storage continued to play out. The trend is expected to have continued in the upcoming quarter, owing to enterprise-grade security and regulatory requirements.



In the last earnings call, the CEO sounded positive about achieving IBM's revenue targets for 2021. Krishna stated, “As we look forward, we’re focused on revenue growth and cash generation.”



He added, ""While we have more work to do, we are confident we can achieve full-year revenue growth and meet our adjusted free cash flow target in 2021.” At the same time, he didn’t specifically mention what those targets are.



The interesting part to note is that the company is making progress to strengthen its balance sheet by paying down all the debt taken to acquire Red Hat, and still maintain a healthy cash balance.



IBM CFO James Kavanaugh’s said in Q1, ""With strong cash generation and disciplined financial management, we increased investments in our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities, while significantly deleveraging in the quarter and supporting our commitment to a secure and growing dividend.” Those are vital points the investors should be looking at this quarter.



Recent Key Developments



Ahead of the second-quarter earnings report, IBM announced the completion of its acquisition of Turbonomic. Turbonomic specializes in providing tools to manage application performance (mainly resource management), along with Kubernetes and network performance. The deal will enable IBM to provide its customers with AI-powered automation capabilities ranging from AIOps (the use of AI to automate IT Operations) to application and infrastructure observability, all built on Red Hat OpenShift to run across any hybrid cloud environment.



Late last month, IBM announced that it will offer its cloud services to the telecom operator Verizon (VZ) to run its 5G networks. IBM and Red Hat will enable Verizon to deploy an open hybrid cloud platform with automated operations and service orchestration.



In addition, IBM collaborated with Spain's Telefonica (TEF) to create a virtual assistant and a blockchain platform based on open hybrid cloud technologies.



During the quarter, the company also made efforts to expand its presence in the edge computing market through partnerships. In this regard, last month, IBM expanded its ecosystem with over 30 new partners including Intel (INTC), Lumen Technologies (LUMN), NetApp (NTAP), and Wipro (WIT), among others.



These new partnerships and agreements are expected to have expanded the company’s client base and added to its top-line numbers in the upcoming quarter.



Analyst Recommendations



On July 2, IBM’s President Jim Whitehurst announced his resignation. Whitehurst was a key figure in the Red Hat integration. He will, however, continue to serve as a senior advisor to IBM CEO Arvind Krishna.



Post-announcement of Whitehurst's resignation, Morgan Stanley analyst Kathryn Huberty reiterated a Hold rating on the stock with a $152 price target (8% upside potential).



Huberty commented, “Whitehurst’s departure is more of a natural progression than a red flag.”



She added, “While investors are concerned that this has negative read-throughs for the health of IBM’s hybrid cloud business and/or future outlook, we see this as a natural progression for Jim, as most of the Red Hat integration is complete.”



The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 4 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average IBM price target of $151.75 implies 7.7% upside potential from the current levels.



IBM scores a 9 of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock is likely to outperform market averages.







Bottom Line



Based on the aforementioned variables, the firm could post solid results in the upcoming quarter, fueled by hybrid cloud expansion, acquisitions, and increased enterprise adoption of AI-based IBM solutions.



However, uncertainty during the pandemic could have led to lower demand for transaction processing software used by banks, airlines, and retail, impacting the upcoming quarter’s performance.



To convince investors that the Q1 rise is sustainable, the company still has a long way to go.

IBM did not divulge the financial terms of the deal. The acquisition, subject to customary closing conditions, is slated to conclude in the second quarter of 2021.



BoxBoat enables organizations to establish containers and Kubernetes to support cloud solutions. BoxBoat helps Fortune 100 and government clients to modernize their existing DevOps solutions.



The buyout will expand IBM's mulicloud transformation and hybrid cloud services to its customers. The deal will increase IBM’s presence in the growing cloud professional services market and also boost Red Hat OpenShift adoption around the world.



IBM’s Senior Vice President of Hybrid Cloud Services, John Granger, said, “Our clients require a cloud architecture that allows them to operate across a traditional IT environment, private cloud and public clouds. That's at the heart of our hybrid cloud approach.""



Granger added, ""No cloud modernization project can succeed without a containerization strategy, and BoxBoat is at the forefront of container services innovation."" (See IBM stock charts on TipRanks)



On July 2, IBM’s President Jim Whitehurst announced his resignation. Whitehurst was a key figure in the Red Hat integration. He will, however, continue to serve as a senior advisor to IBM CEO Arvind Krishna.



On July 6, Morgan Stanley analyst Kathryn Huberty reiterated a Hold rating on the stock with a $152 price target (8% upside potential).



Huberty believes Whitehurst’s departure to be “more of a natural progression than a red flag.”



She further added, “While investors are concerned that this has negative read-throughs for the health of IBM’s hybrid cloud business and/or future outlook, we see this as a natural progression for Jim, as most of the Red Hat integration is complete.”



The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 4 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average IBM price target of $151.75 implies 7.8% upside potential from current levels. Shares have increased 9.5% over the past six months.



IBM scores a 6 of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock is likely to perform in line with market averages.

Its products include cloud services, operating systems, enterprise software, software development tools, computer hardware, and gaming programs and hardware.



The main value for MSFT comes from its vast, highly technical, and economically valuable intellectual property portfolio as well as the significant switching costs that its business clients face once they are using its systems. The company enjoys particularly strong positions in its operating system, office business units, and cloud computing business segments and is also seeing strong growth across most of its business units. Its Azure cloud platform is seeing the most robust growth, as its revenue was up 50% year-over-year in their most recent quarterly results.



In its most recent quarter, MSFT announced astonishingly strong 39.3% year-over-year earnings-per-share growth, reflecting the strong demand for its competitively positioned products. 



Given its strong brain trust from the top-tier talent it attracts, MSFT should continue to enjoy a strong competitive position for years to come. At the same time, it is unlikely that the company will grow earnings at the same clip as it has in its most recent quarter. MSFT is also enhancing its earnings-per-share growth by repurchasing shares at a steady rate, and has been growing its dividend-per-share at a fast pace every year for the past 19 years. (See Microsoft stock charts on TipRanks)



Valuation Metrics



Despite the company’s remarkable momentum and long-term potential, its valuation appears rather rich. Its forward price to earnings ratio is 34.7x compared to its 5-year average of 26.1x. Furthermore, their enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is 23.1x compared to its 5-year average of 16x.



As a result, while earnings-per-share will likely continue to grow steadily, likely multiple compression back towards historical averages will eat into total returns. Additionally, the dividend yield is currently a paltry 0.8%, so the dividend will not contribute much towards total returns.



Wall Street’s Take



From Wall Street analysts, MSFT earns a Strong Buy analyst consensus based on 27 Buy ratings in the past 3 months. Additionally, the average Microsoft price target of $297.96 puts the upside potential at 6.44%. 







Summary and Conclusions



MSFT is riding significant momentum from its rapidly growing Azure cloud business, while its other business segments continue to generate strong growth as well. Additionally, share buybacks and dividend growth are bolstering shareholder returns and combine with MSFT’s strong competitive advantages, growth, and unanimous Wall Street analyst bullishness to make it appear to be an attractive investment.



That said, based on historical valuation multiples, the stock looks expensive right now and the dividend yield is too low to make a significant contribution to total returns. Furthermore, growth on a per-share basis is highly unlikely to keep up with its most recent quarterly pace. Last but not least, MSFT’s cloud business faces strong competition from fellow tech giants such as Amazon (AMZN), Oracle (ORCL), Google (GOOG), and IBM (IBM).



MSFT certainly has a lot going for it and may be worth an investment right now, but investors should not expect future returns to repeat the stock’s past performance, given its rich valuation.
