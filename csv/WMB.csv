The company’s operations are located in the United States.



The company’s business segments include Transmission & Gulf of Mexico, Northeast Gathering and Processing, and West. Transmission & Gulf of Mexico consists of the company’s interstate natural gas pipelines, Transco and Northwest Pipeline. This business segment also comprises the gathering and processing of natural gas.



WMB has a 51% interest in Gulfstar One (a proprietary floating production system), an equity method interest of 50% in Gulfstream, and a 60% equity method investment in Discovery. These assets handle the production of crude oil and transportation in the Gulf Coast region.



The Northeast Gathering and Processing segment consists of midstream gathering, processing, and fractionation businesses in the Utica Shale region of eastern Ohio, and the Marcellus Shale region, which is primarily in Pennsylvania and New York.



The West business segment comprises gas gathering, processing, and treating operations in the Rocky Mountain region of Colorado and Wyoming, the Eagle Ford Shale region of south Texas, the Barnett Shale region of north-central Texas, the Haynesville Shale region of northwest Louisiana, and the Mid-Continent region which includes the Anadarko, Arkoma, and Permian basins. (See Williams stock chart on TipRanks)



Many analysts are bullish on Williams stock. Here are a few reasons why. 



Q1 Results and FY21 Outlook



In Q1, Williams reported strong results with total revenues of $2,612 million, up 36.5% year-over-year. Diluted earnings came in at $0.35 per share versus a loss of $0.43 per share in the same quarter last year. The company reported adjusted EBITDA of $1.42 billion, up 12% year-over-year.



WMB expects adjusted EBITDA between $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion in FY21 while the leverage ratio is expected to be approximately 4.2x. Williams anticipates capex to range from $1 billion to $1.2 billion.



Last month, Wells Fargo analyst Praneeth Satish hosted WMB’s President & CEO Alan Armstrong and EVP & COO Michael Dunn in a virtual meeting with investors. The analyst came away bullish on the stock, with a Buy rating and a price target of $28.



Satish said in a note to investors, “Management believes investors could be under-appreciating the following growth drivers for the company: (1) WMB's plan to convert upstream acreage into midstream cashflow in 2022, (2) Gulf of Mexico growth in 2024-25, and (3) a long runway of ratable growth projects on Transco (that can backstop any slowdown in growth). Taken together, we believe our 5-year EBITDA CAGR forecast of 2% could prove conservative.”



WMB’s Joint Venture in the Wamsutter Field



On July 6, WMB announced an upstream joint venture (JV) with Crowheart Energy (Crowheart) in the Wamsutter Field of the Greater Green River Basin of Wyoming that would involve “the consolidation of three legacy operating assets consisting of over 1.2 million net acres, over 3,500 operating wells, and more than 3,000 potential development locations.”



Initially, WMB will have 75% interest in the JV while Crowheart will own the remaining 25% interest. 



The company said in its press release that the strategic effort involved in combining the “Wamsutter Field reserves will enhance the value of its midstream and downstream natural gas and NGL infrastructure.”



Analyst Satish appreciated this growth initiative and said that “this will be an NPV positive transaction for WMB and drive incremental EBITDA growth in 2022. In contrast, we are modeling effectively flat EBITDA in 2022 (versus 2021).”



Collaboration with Microsoft and Acquisition of Sequent Energy Management



Last month, WMB signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Microsoft (MSFT) to explore lower carbon opportunities and focus on the development of renewable natural gas products, hydrogen economy, and energy storage solutions. Through the MoU, WMB will also look at ways to use Microsoft Azure services and solutions to monitor and report its emissions and improve them.



Earlier this month, Williams also completed the acquisition of Sequent Energy Management, L.P., and Sequent Energy Canada, Corp. from Southern Company Gas, which was announced in May. WMB acquired Sequent for $50 million in addition to acquiring the working capital of the company.



WMB’s President and CEO, Alan Armstrong said, “The addition of Sequent Energy Management, including its talented workforce and industry leading platform, complements the current geographic footprint of our core pipeline transportation and storage business… “



“Sequent’s operational footprint in the U.S. and Canada provides Williams with an enhanced North American perspective of natural gas markets, in turn bolstering the company’s natural gas focused strategy, and I’m excited to welcome the Sequent employees to the Williams family,” Armstrong added.



WMB’s management told analyst Satish in the virtual meeting that through its partnership with Microsoft, “emissions can be tracked along the value chain and the data can be used to certify emissions free/low emission gas is being delivered to customers. Combined with WMB's recent Sequent (marketing) acquisition, the company could soon be competitively positioned to deliver low emission / zero emission gas to customers across the country.”



WMB’s Natural Gas Pipeline, Transco



Williams’ management said in the virtual investor conference that its Transco pipeline had a robust backlog of “rate base opportunities” but the management is currently not pursuing these opportunities as the company is looking at other projects with higher returns.



Furthermore, WMB noted that the rate base projects on Transco could earn a return on equity (ROE) between 12.5% and 12.75%. Analyst Satish noted, “These projects have a utility-like risk/return, but should still be accretive in the low rate environment. For now, WMB is pursuing emissions reduction projects, which carry a higher double-digit return. However, the company noted it always has the option to fall back on rate base projects.”



Gulf of Mexico



The company has projected the completion of the expansion of infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico between 2024 and 2025, WMB’s management told investors. According to WMB, this could result in doubling the EBITDA for the Gulf of Mexico.



Analyst Satish stated, “In contrast, we are projecting only a 50% increase. If EBITDA doubled, this would represent an incremental ~$150MM to our outer year EBITDA projections.”



As a part of this initiative, last month, WMB entered into an export agreement with Beacon Offshore Energy Development LLC and its co-owner ShenHai, LLC, a subsidiary of Navitas Petroleum. Through this agreement, Beacon Offshore Energy Development will provide offshore natural gas gathering and transportation services and onshore natural gas processing services to the Shenandoah development through the Discovery infrastructure in the central Gulf of Mexico.



WMB’s COO Michael Dunn said, “Our investment in Shenandoah is a strategic expansion of our Gulf of Mexico infrastructure which further strengthens our portfolio of services. We are pleased to provide the entire spectrum of midstream capabilities to Beacon that will capture the full value of these important deepwater resources.”



Analysts' Consensus



Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 9 Buys and 1 Hold. The average Williams Companies price target of $28.60 implies approximately 9.3% upside potential to current levels.

These include increases in commodity prices, specifically, oil prices, which have rallied recently. In addition, the January jobs numbers, released earlier this month, were disappointing at best – and grim, at worst. They, do, however, increase the chance that President Biden and the Democratic Congress will push a large-scale COVID relief package through to fruition.These factors are likely to pull in varying directions. The rise in oil prices suggests an upcoming squeeze in supply, while the possibility of further stimulus cash bodes well for fans of market liquidity. These developments, however, point toward a possible price reflationary climate.Against this backdrop, some investors are looking for ways to rebuild and defend their portfolios. And that will bring us to dividends. By providing a steady income stream, no matter what the market conditions, a reliable dividend stock provides a pad for your investment portfolio when the share stop appreciating.And so, we’ve opened up the TipRanks database and pulled the details on two stocks with high yields – at least 7%. Even better, these stocks are seen as Strong Buys by Wall Street’s analysts. Let’s find out why.Williams Companies (WMB)The first stock we'll look at is Williams Companies, a natural gas processing firm based in Oklahoma. Williams controls pipelines for natural gas, natural gas liquids, and oil gathering, in a network stretching from the Pacific Northwest, through the Rockies to the Gulf Coast, and across the South to the Mid-Atlantic. Williams’ core business is the processing and transport of natural gas, with crude oil and energy generation as secondary operations. The company’s footprint is huge – it handles almost one-third of all natural gas use in the US, both residential and commercial.Williams will report its 4Q20 results late this month – but a look at the Q3 results is informative. The company reported $1.93 billion at the top line, down 3.5% year-over-year but up 8.4% quarter-over-quarter, and the highest quarterly revenue so far released for 2020. Net earnings came in at 25 cents per share, flat from Q2 but up 38% year-over-year. The report was widely held as meeting or exceeding expectations, and the stock gained 7% in the two weeks after it was released.In a move that may indicate a solid Q4 earnings on the way, the company declared its next dividend, to be paid out on March 29. The 41-cent per common share payment is up 2.5% from the previous quarter, and annualizes to $1.64. At that rate, the dividend yields 7.1%. Williams has a 4-year history of dividend growth and maintenance, and typically raises the payment in the first quarter of the year.Covering the stock for RBC, 5-star analyst TJ Schultz wrote: “We believe Williams can hit the low-end of its 2020 EBITDA guidance. While we expect near-term growth in the NE to moderate, we think WMB should benefit from less than previously expected associated gas from the Permian. Given our long-term view, we estimate Williams can remain comfortably within investment grade credit metrics through our forecast period and keep the dividend intact.”To this end, Schultz rates WMB an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his $26 price target suggests an upside of 13% in the next 12 months. (To watch Schultz’s track record, click here)With 8 recent reviews on record, including 7 Buys and just 1 Hold, WMB has earned its Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. While the stock has gained in recent months, reaching $23, the average price target of $25.71 implies it still has room for ~12% growth this year. (See WMB stock analysis on TipRanks)AGNC Investment (AGNC)Next up is AGNC Investment, a real estate investment trust. It’s no surprise to find a REIT as a dividend champ – these companies are required by tax codes to return a high percentage of profits directly to shareholders, and frequently use dividends as the vehicle for compliance. AGNC, based in Maryland, focuses on MBSs (mortgage-backed securities) with backing and guarantees from the US government. These securities make up some two-thirds of the company’s total portfolio, or $65.1 billion out of the $97.9 billion total.AGNC’s most recent quarterly returns, for 4Q20, showed $459 million in net revenue, and a net income per share of $1.37. While down yoy, the EPS was the strongest recorded for 2020. For the full year, AGNC reported $1.68 billion in total revenues, and $1.56 per share paid out in dividends.The current dividend, 12 cents per common share paid out monthly, will annualize to $1.44; the difference from last year’s higher annualization rate is due to a dividend cut implemented in April in response to the coronavirus crisis. At the current rate, the dividend gives investors a robust yield of 8.8%, and is easily affordable for the company given current income.Among AGNC's bulls is Maxim analyst Michael Diana who wrote: “AGNC has retained a competitive yield on book value relative to other mortgage REITs (mREITS), even as it has out-earned its dividend and repurchased shares. While turmoil in the mortgage markets at the end of March resulted in losses and lower book values for all mortgage REITs, AGNC was able to meet all of its margin calls and, importantly, take relatively fewer realized losses and therefore retain more earnings power post-turmoil.”Based on all of the above, Diana rates AGNC a Buy, along with an $18 price target. This figure implies a ~10% upside potential from current levels. (To watch Diana’s track record, click here)Wall Street is on the same page. Over the last couple of months, AGNC has received 7 Buys and a single Hold -- all add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. However, the $16.69 average price target suggests shares will remain range bound for the foreseeable future.
