The deal will close by early Q3. Vigene is expected to generate between $30 million and $35 million in 2021, and Charles River anticipates year-over-year growth of 25% by 2026. With the addition of Vigene, the Charles River cell and gene therapy portfolio will expand each major CDMO platform: cell therapy, viral vector, and plasmid DNA production, said CEO James Foster. Vigene has particular expertise in AAV production, as well as lentivirus. That range will complement Charles River’s current end-to-end, gene-modified cell therapy solution. Viral vectors are key components used in many gene therapies and reinforce Charles River’s growing presence in the field after a spate of recent acquisitions. In February, the company had acquired Cognate with capabilities in cellular immunotherapy, immuno-oncology, regenerative medicine, and advanced cell therapy therapeutics. In January, Charles River bought antibody discovery company Distributed Bio for up to $104 million.

Foster said, “The addition of Vigene Biosciences’ extensive gene therapy expertise will enable us to expand our comprehensive cell and gene therapy portfolio to span each of the major CDMO platforms- cell therapy, viral vector, and plasmid DNA production.” (See Charles River stock analysis on TipRanks)Foster added, “In these emerging, high-growth, value-added segments, we intend to continue to differentiate ourselves by bringing our high-science, customizable approach to support the complex needs of cell and gene therapy developers and innovators worldwide.”The acquisition enhances the gene therapy expertise of Charles River, complements its present non-clinical development and manufacturing portfolio, and increases its exposure to the high growth market sector of cell and gene therapy CDMO services.Furthermore, the acquisition is expected to be accretive to Charles River’s long-term topline as well as bottom-line growth. For 2021, Vigene is estimated to generate revenue of $30 to $35 million. It is expected to record annual growth of at least 25% over the next five years.On May 14, KeyBanc analyst Donald Hooker reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $360 (9.4% upside potential) from $340.Charles River’s Investor Day is scheduled for May 27. Hooker expects management to revise its long-term growth target upwards at the event, which might act as “a potential catalyst” for the stock.Based on 10 Buys and 1 Hold consensus among analysts is that Charles River is a Strong Buy. The average analyst price target of $325.27 implies the stock is almost fairly priced at current levels.

Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Charles River has. Charles River's Debt Based on Charles River's financial statement as of February 17, 2021, long-term debt is at $1.93 billion and current debt is at $50.21 million, amounting to $1.98 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $228.42 million in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $1.75 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Charles River's $5.49 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.36. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Importance Of Debt Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital. However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.
