Wexner and some other stockholders.



The company does not seek to receive any proceeds from the sale of shares in the offering.



Upon closing of the offering, L Brands will be repurchasing up to 10 million shares of its common stock from one of the selling stockholders. The repurchase price will be equal to the public offering price, less the underwriting discount. (See L Brands stock chart on TipRanks)



Also, the company seeks to fund stock buyback with cash in hand. J.P. Morgan is acting as the sole book-running manager for the offering.



After completion of the offering and buyback, the selling stockholders are expected to have disposed all of their shares of L Brands’ common stock, other than five million shares.



Last month, Evercore ISI analyst Omar Saad reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $75 (upside potential of 1.2%). The analyst expects L Brands to report earnings per share of $0.99 for the second quarter of 2021.



The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 8 Buys, 6 Holds and 1 Sell. The average L Brands price target of $78.43 implies 7.2% upside potential from current levels.

(LB) reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, backed by continued momentum at both Bath & Body Works and Victoria’s Secret. L Brands is an international fashion retailer offering fragrance and body care products, soaps, women’s apparel, and beauty care products.



The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.25 per share compared to a loss of $0.99 per share recorded in the same period last year, and surpassed the Street’s expectations of $1.21 per share.



The company’s net sales came in at $3.02 billion, up 83% year-over-year, and beat the Street’s estimates of $3.01 billion. Shares of the company fell 3.1% to close at $67.31 on May 19. (See L Brands stock analysis on TipRanks)



Looking at the company's individual properties, net sales at Bath & Body Works were up 93% at $1.47 billion year-over-year. Victoria’s Secret reported net sales of $1.55 billion. 



Commenting on the results, Andrew Meslow, CEO of L Brands, said, “We are pleased that the momentum in both businesses has continued, driven by positive customer responses to our assortments, which allowed us to reduce promotional activity and deliver substantial increases in our merchandise margin rates.”



The company is not giving any guidance for full year 2021 owing to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 situation and also the pending separation of Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works into two distinct companies.



However, the company does forecast Q2 earnings to fall between $0.80 and $1.00 per share. The Street predicts earnings at $0.76 per share.



Following the Q1 results, Guggenheim analyst Robert Drbul maintained a Hold rating on the stock and stated, “We believe both the tailwinds (Bath & Body Works strength) and headwinds (Victoria's Secret turnaround, challenging mall trends overall) facing the company today are appropriately reflected in the shares, with continued strength at Bath & Body Works and signs of improvement at Victoria's Secret in 1Q.”



The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 10 Buys versus 7 Holds. The average analyst price target of $78.65 implies 23.9% upside potential to current levels. Shares have gained around 70% year-to-date.



L Brands scores an 8 out of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

The split will result in Victoria's Secret, a lingerie and beauty retailer, and Bath & Body Works, a specialty fragrance retailer, becoming independent publicly traded companies. L Brands plans to process the Victoria's Secret spin-off in a manner that will avoid tax consequences for its shareholders. The company believes the separation will allow the units to thrive in a retail environment that is evolving. L Brands’ board chair Sarah Nash said the company has spent the last 10 months improving merchandise and marketing, as well as controlling costs, in order to increase profitability. Consequently, Victoria's Secret has become well-grounded enough to run as a standalone company. “The Board believes that this path forward will return the highest value to shareholders and that the separation will allow each business to achieve its best opportunities for growth,” said Nash. L Brands had considered selling before it chose to spin off the lingerie brand. It expects to complete the transaction in August 2021. Alongside the split announcement, L Brands said it expects to report strong first-quarter earnings. (See L Brands stock analysis on TipRanks) Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow reiterated a Buy rating and raised the price target to $84 from $78. Boruchow’s new price target implies 24.32% upside potential to the current price. The analyst likes L Brands’ optimistic earnings forecast and the planned tax-free Victoria's Secret spin-off. “For the third time this quarter, L Brands raised its earnings outlook,” commented Boruchow. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is that LB is a Moderate Buy, based on 10 Buy and 7 Hold ratings. The average analyst price target of $71.88 implies 6.38% upside potential to current levels.

(NYSE: LB) today announced its Board of Directors has unanimously approved a plan to separate the company into two independent, public companies: Bath & Body Works, one of the world’s leading bath, body and home fragrance retailers, and Victoria’s Secret, including Victoria’s Secret Lingerie, PINK and Victoria’s Secret Beauty, a leading retailer of intimates and beauty products. The company expects to create these companies through a tax-free spin-off of Victoria’s Secret to L Brands’ shareholders. The spin-off will enable each company to maximize management focus and financial flexibility to thrive in an evolving retail environment and deliver profitable growth. “In the last ten months, we have made significant progress in the turnaround of the Victoria’s Secret business, implementing merchandise and marketing initiatives to drive top line growth, as well as executing on a series of cost reduction actions, which together have dramatically increased profitability,” said Sarah Nash, Chair of the Board. “As a result of these efforts, Victoria’s Secret is now well-positioned to operate as a standalone, public company. Further, both Bath & Body Works and Victoria’s Secret are leaders in their respective markets, and, as separate businesses, each will be ideally positioned to benefit from a sharpened focus on pursuing growth strategies best suited to each company’s customer base and strategic objectives. With this in mind, the Board believes that this path forward will return the highest value to shareholders and that the separation will allow each business to achieve its best opportunities for growth.” As previously announced, the L Brands Board has been evaluating the possibility of either a spin-off or sale of Victoria’s Secret with input from its financial advisors, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. Throughout the review process, the company received interest from and held discussions with multiple potential buyers. Ultimately, the Board concluded that the spin-off of Victoria’s Secret into a separate, public company would provide shareholders with more value than a sale. The benefits of separating these two businesses include distinct strategic and management focus on specific operational and growth priorities and tailored capital deployment strategies based on each company’s operating and financial model, and the ability for the investment community to value each business independently and create significant value and certainty for our customers, employees and shareholders. The proposed transaction will create two highly focused companies: Bath & Body Works (L Brands): Leading Bath, Body and Home Fragrance Retailer Bath & Body Works is one of the world’s leading specialty retailers. Home to America’s Favorite Fragrances®, Bath & Body Works offers a breadth of exclusive fragrances for the body and home, including top-selling collections for body lotion and body cream, body wash, hand soap, hand sanitizers, fragrance diffusers, fine fragrance mist and candles. The business has a demonstrated record of consistent sales and operating income growth, as well as a proven ability to respond quickly to evolving customer tastes with a high-speed sourcing and logistics model. With high brand awareness and a loyal customer base, the business is well positioned for continued growth in North America, as well as globally. Victoria’s Secret: Iconic Lingerie and Beauty Retailer Victoria’s Secret is an iconic global brand of women’s intimate and other apparel, personal care and beauty products. It sells products through two brands, Victoria’s Secret and PINK. Victoria’s Secret is a category-defining global lingerie brand with a leading market position and a rich, 40-year history of serving women across the globe. PINK is a lifestyle brand for the college-oriented customer, built around a strong intimates core. It also sells beauty products under both the Victoria’s Secret and PINK brands. Together, Victoria’s Secret, PINK and Victoria’s Secret Beauty support, inspire and celebrate women through every phase of their life. The business recently implemented a profit improvement plan, and took actions to improve its product assortment, inventory mix and marketing to meet customers’ needs and evolve to more diverse and inclusive brand positioning. As a result of these efforts, Victoria’s Secret delivered a 2020 fall season (third and fourth quarters) adjusted operating income increase of more than 300 percent and is well positioned to continue to drive global growth. Management Structure Both businesses have strong, well-tenured leadership teams with significant industry experience, well suited to lead the two companies going forward in their distinct markets. Andrew Meslow, Chief Executive Officer of L Brands, will continue to hold this position and lead Bath & Body Works following the spin-off. Martin Waters, Chief Executive Officer of Victoria’s Secret, will continue to lead the new standalone Victoria’s Secret business following the separation. Additions to the management teams and the composition of the boards of directors for both companies will be named in due course. Transaction Details The spin-off is expected to be effected through a pro-rata distribution to L Brands shareholders of common stock of a newly-formed entity holding certain assets and liabilities comprising the Victoria’s Secret business. The spin-off is generally expected to qualify as tax free to L Brands and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The transaction is currently expected to be completed in August 2021, subject to certain customary conditions, including final approval of the L Brands Board and effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Preliminary First Quarter 2021 Results L Brands expects to report first quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.97, which includes a charge related to the early extinguishment of debt of $0.28 per share. Excluding this charge, the company expects to report adjusted earnings per share of approximately $1.25 versus its previous guidance of $0.85 to $1.00. The increase reflects continuing strong sales and margin results at both Bath & Body Works and Victoria’s Secret, which benefitted from stimulus payments and the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions, as previously reported. For the first quarter, the company expects to report total operating income of approximately $570 million, including approximately $380 million at Bath & Body Works and approximately $245 million at Victoria’s Secret. The company will report its first quarter earnings results after the close of the market on May 19. Meslow commented “We anticipate L Brands will deliver a record first quarter earnings result, driven by continued strength and exceptional performance at Bath & Body Works and a significant improvement at Victoria’s Secret. We are confident in the growth opportunities for each business and are excited to share our vision for each business as we continue to work toward the August separation.” The company reported net sales of $3.024 billion for the first quarter ended May 1, 2021, compared to net sales of $1.654 billion for the first quarter ended May 2, 2020. First quarter 2020 sales were negatively impacted by the closure of stores for approximately half the quarter due to the COVID-19 pandemic. First quarter 2021 sales increased 15 percent compared to sales of $2.629 billion in the first quarter of 2019. At Bath & Body Works, net sales were $1.469 billion for the first quarter ended May 1, 2021, compared to net sales of $760.6 million for the first quarter ended May 2, 2020. First quarter 2021 sales increased 60 percent compared to the first quarter of 2019. First quarter 2021 U.S. and Canada store sales increased 47 percent to $1.050 billion compared to $714.3 million in 2019. First quarter 2021 sales in the direct channel were $349.2 million, an increase of 21 percent compared to 2020 and a 123 percent increase compared to 2019. At Victoria’s Secret, net sales were $1.554 billion for the first quarter ended May 1, 2021, compared to net sales of $893.6 million for the first quarter ended May 2, 2020. First quarter 2021 sales decreased 7 percent compared to the first quarter of 2019 and reflect the net closure of 233 company-operated stores since the first quarter of 2019. Comparable U.S. and Canada store sales for the first quarter of 2021 decreased 3% compared to the first quarter of 2019. First quarter 2021 sales in the direct channel were $520.9 million, an increase of 69 percent compared to 2020 and a 44 percent increase compared to 2019.
