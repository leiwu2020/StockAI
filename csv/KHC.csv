The plant at Kitt Green is Europe's largest food processing facility and makes tinned foods such as baked beans, soups and pasta. The investment will upgrade the plant and machinery, make the facility more environmentally friendly and bring manufacturing of Heinz ketchup, Salad Cream and mayonnaise back to Britain and create up to 50 full-time jobs. Heinz sauces used to be made at a factory in Telford before production was moved to Europe in 1999. It will also mark Kraft Heinz's biggest investment in more than 20 years in a manufacturing site outside its US heartland. Luis Spinardi, the site director, said: “As a result of this proposed investment, we are now in the fortunate position where Kitt Green can become a much more modern facility and our teams will have the ability to adopt more contemporary ways of working while exemplifying the highest global standards for food manufacturing."" Kitt Green produces 1.3bn cans of food a year, of which 94pc is consumed in the UK. This new investment will allow it to increase output. The move is a boost for the Government's ""levelling up"" agenda aimed at reviving the economy in the north of England and making the country less London-centric. Gerry Grimstone, the investment minister, said: ""The US is a key trading partner and we are committed to striking an ambitious trade deal that opens up new opportunities for our businesses, brings in more investment and creates better jobs for people across the whole of the country."" No other Kraft Heinz factories elsewhere in the world were getting an upgrade of this magnitude, a spokeswoman said. She said the technology that will replace older machines had not been used in any company facility and would mean better quality products and more efficient production. The packaging will be fully recyclable also. In addition to employing 50 additional staff, Kitt Green is also training existing staff to operate the new machinery. Joe Clarke, of the Unite Union, said the investment was a ""just reward"" for the hard work its members had put in during the pandemic to keep food on supermarket shelves. Kraft Heinz will give the investment final approval later this year.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=df43b94af55aa24859f0599296eebaa21e8ff1559c73e0f2a5bae94a1a6d58c8

The digital token later retreated by about 20% Tuesday, reducing its market value by around $10 billion from the high.The surge had made it bigger than the market cap of Ford Motor Co. and Kraft Heinz Co. -- and nearly equal to Twitter Inc., the platform where Elon Musk and Mark Cuban have promoted the Shiba Inu-themed meme coin.No one thinks these blue-chip stocks are all that comparable to Dogecoin, a fringe asset with no real purpose beyond being a joke on social media. But the similarity of their market values underscores the boom in cryptocurrencies that’s taken Wall Street by storm.Plumber Buying Doge Shows Retail Investors’ Power in CryptoIt’s all part of the dizzying trajectory for Dogecoin, which has delighted followers of so-called alt coins, but dismayed some crypto enthusiasts who worry that it’s only adding to volatility and detracting from its more useful endeavors, like decentralized finance.Dogecoin prices have rallied recently, with fans rallying behind the #DogeDay hashtag to celebrate April 20, or 4/20, known in cannabis culture as a day for smoking marijuana. Prices pulled back to around 31 cents on Tuesday, according to CoinGecko.com.Meanwhile, other cryptocurrencies have been mired in a slump as euphoria from Coinbase Global Inc.’s listing wears off. Bitcoin, the world’s largest token, edged up about 1% after falling for four straight days, to about $56,800.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7ec5b72eedf07e36e23c9e24189f35c65eafa2dd3dc160b5018320bba9fb89f2
