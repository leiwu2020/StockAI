March 19 was the initial deadline for approval in China, the final remaining jurisdiction where sign-off is needed.As the world’s largest market for semiconductors, Chinese regulatory approval is essential for this deal. Semiconductors are a key area of contention between the U.S. and China. Other deals in the industry awaiting regulatory sign-off from China include the Analog Devices Inc. acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products Inc. and the Marvell Technology Group Ltd. purchase of Inphi Corp.Applied Materials initially agreed to buy Kokusai, a Japanese maker of semiconductor equipment in 2019. In January, Applied Materials raised its offer 59%, citing higher valuations in a growing chip industry. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index is up about 10% this year, following a 51% surge in 2020. Shares of Applied Materials are up 39% this year.Applied Materials also said its board has approved a new $7.5 billion stock-buyback authorization, supplementing its current program, which has roughly $1.3 billion remaining.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b8f93d094d2c7915dc265b6ea3b868f435ad6c5ce19fcfa4a45433bd0d2e3d8f
