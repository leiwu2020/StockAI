When Canada banned cruising through 2022, it was seen as a major impediment to the popular summer cruises to Alaska. Alaska cruises traditionally stop in Canada, because U.S. maritime law bars foreign-flagged ships from transporting passengers directly between two U.S. ports. But Congress last week approved a waiver on the rule, paving the way for Norwegian’s announcement.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cruise ships can only return if they follow one of two paths. They can either confirm 95% of passengers and 98% of crew are vaccinated, or they can go through a rigorous approval process with no-revenue trial sailings for each ship. Norwegian is pursuing the former path, and said it expects to obtain a so-called conditional sailing certificate from the CDC “in the coming days.”But it’s also noteworthy that the initial restart will be far from Florida, home of Norwegian’s corporate headquarters and the world’s largest cruise port, PortMiami. Norwegian is making vaccinations mandatory on all its initial voyages, and Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, said so-called vaccine passports are illegal under state rules he pushed for.Carnival’s Princess Cruises, Holland America Line and Carnival Cruise Line brands are also restarting with Alaska sailings from Seattle, as are Royal Caribbean ships Serenade and Ovation of the Seas.Norwegian shares were up 2.7% to $29.47 at 9:58 a.m. in New York, while Royal Caribbean added 1.9% to $84.42. Carnival rose 1.3% to $27.52.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=06ec1348f2299ad613637a515327c1b816fe8d38b93df0cab319e34e6e44dd71

(the “Company”) (NYSE: NCLH), a leading global cruise company which operates the Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands, today announced its much anticipated expected return to cruising in the U.S. this summer with Alaska cruises on Norwegian Bliss sailing from Seattle beginning August 7, 2021. The restart of cruising in the U.S. is contingent on obtaining a Conditional Sailing Certificate from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), which the Company expects to be granted in the coming days. Voyages will operate with all guests and crew required to be fully vaccinated, along with the implementation of the Company’s robust, multi-layered SailSAFETM health and safety program. “We are thrilled to reach the next milestone in our Great Cruise Comeback with the expected resumption of cruising in the U.S. starting in Alaska, one of our guests’ most popular destinations. This is a moment we have all been waiting for and it would not have been possible without the strong support of the Alaska congressional delegation who worked tirelessly to pass legislation that temporarily waives certain requirements of the Passenger Vessel Services Act,” said Frank Del Rio, president and chief executive officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. “Cruise travel is vital to Alaska’s extensive tourism economy and we collaboratively worked alongside local, state and national authorities to find a path forward to resume cruise operations and provide much needed relief to the families, communities and small businesses who rely on cruise tourism for their livelihoods. We look forward to re-starting the broad cruise ecosystem which supports thousands of American jobs and welcoming our guests back onboard to create memories of a lifetime.” The Company previously announced its two-pronged plan for its long-awaited return to cruising within and outside of the U.S. this summer. In April, the Company announced its phased cruise resumption for voyages embarking outside of the U.S. with seven ships across its three award-winning brands. The Company continues to expect a phased-in approach to reintroducing additional vessels across its three brands while taking into account the public health environment, global travel restrictions and port availability, among other considerations. All voyages will operate with the Company’s comprehensive SailSAFETM health and safety protocols which were developed with leading public health and scientific experts including the Healthy Sail Panel and the SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council. The Company’s SailSAFE protocols will be continuously evaluated and modified with the latest science and technology. About Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.

Chief Executive Officer Frank Del Rio said July sailings from the U.S. are no longer possible, given the time it takes to get a ship ready to sail.“The July U.S. launch, at least for our company, is just not possible,” Del Rio said, speaking on a quarterly call with analysts.He didn’t give a specific timeline, but the industry generally has said that it needs 90 days to prepare a ship.Norwegian shares fell as much as 6.8% to $27.81 in New York trading after the comments. Industry leader Carnival Corp. was down as much as 3.8%, and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. shed as much as 4.8%.Del Rio’s comments come a day after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention outlined new rules for returning to the seas.Speculation had been mounting about a July return after President Joe Biden projected the country could resume a semblance of normalcy by Independence Day. On the back of Biden’s announcement in March, the industry started actively lobbying the U.S. government to roll back restrictions on cruising, which the companies say are the most burdensome on any U.S. tourism business.Norwegian and its peers have found halting progress in their efforts.New rules outlined Wednesday create two parallel paths for cruise companies to return to U.S. waters. They can start paying cruises up again with certain limitations, provided 95% of passengers and 98% of crew are vaccinated. If they don’t meet the vaccination requirement, they can run simulated cruises with nonpaying volunteers for each ship in their fleet, essentially proving the safety of their vessels.100% VaccinationDel Rio said Norwegian would be opting for the first option, adding that the cruise company would demand 100% vaccination -- even more than the CDC requirement.But Del Rio said he was disappointed in the rules “at first read” and found them onerous. As an example, Del Rio complained about a guideline that states that while temporary mask removal is acceptable while eating or drinking, facial coverings cannot stay off for “extended meal service or beverage consumption.”“Nobody should order soup, because your mask might get sloppy,” Del Rio said. “So that to me is just preposterous; it’s not in the spirit of where the country is heading.”Cruise companies continued to set sail in the first two weeks of March 2020, even after Covid-19 had begun to strain global hospital systems and batter stock markets, and after the U.S. State Department had warned citizens against traveling on the vessels. The companies suspended U.S. sailings in the middle of that month as the pandemic took hold in earnest.(Updates with CEO’s comments in 10th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4a6f68cf188983d7d146ddf65e1ab46c987118189a06d829aa45f0c86f345bc1

(NYSE: NCLH) (together with NCL Corporation Ltd., “Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings”, “Norwegian” or the “Company”) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021 and provided a business update. “Over a year after the initial global suspension of cruise voyages, we are pleased to have announced our Great Cruise Comeback program beginning with voyages originating from international ports. Our teams have worked tirelessly and enlisted the guidance of top public health officials and scientific experts to develop our robust, science-backed SailSAFETM health and safety program, which combines mandatory vaccination of all guests and crew with rigorous preventative measures including universal COVID-19 testing. With our SailSAFE program we believe we can provide a uniquely safe and healthy experience which exceeds all other vacation options available on land or at sea,” said Frank Del Rio, president and chief executive officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. “As for the resumption of cruises from the U.S., we continue to engage in dialogue with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Our team is working through the recently issued and modified technical guidance for which additional clarification is needed on how the incorporation of vaccine requirements impacts the Conditional Sail Order and our path forward.” Health and Safety The Company is committed to protecting the health and safety of its guests, crew and communities visited and has developed SailSAFE, a robust, science-backed health and safety program which creates multiple layers of protection against COVID-19. The SailSAFE health and safety program is informed by expert guidance from the Healthy Sail Panel (“HSP”) and the Company's SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council (“Council”). All initial voyages will operate with fully vaccinated guests and crew in addition to comprehensive SailSAFE protocols, which include universal COVID-19 testing prior to embarkation. These measures will be continuously refined as science, technology and the knowledge of COVID-19 evolves. The Company also further extended its depth and breadth of experts with the formation of its SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council, comprised of six experts at the forefront of their fields and led by Chairman Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former Commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Co-Chair of the HSP. The Council’s work will complement the HSP initiative and will focus on the implementation, compliance with and continuous improvement of health and safety protocols across the Company’s operations.

For more information on the Company’s SailSAFE health and safety program please visit: http://www.nclhltd.com/Health-and-Safety. Resumption of Cruise Operations On April 6, 2021, the Company unveiled its two-pronged plan for its long-awaited return to cruising within and outside the U.S. this summer. The Company has announced its phased cruise resumption for voyages embarking outside of the U.S. across its three brands, which include: Norwegian Cruise Line- Norwegian Cruise Line will initially offer seven-day cruises to the Greek Isles on Norwegian Jade from Athens (Piraeus), Greece beginning July 25, 2021, and seven-day Caribbean itineraries originating in Montego Bay, Jamaica beginning on August 7, 2021 on Norwegian Joy and from La Romana, Dominican Republic on Norwegian Gem beginning August 15, 2021. Beginning in September, Norwegian Cruise Line will offer voyages in the Mediterranean departing from Barcelona and Rome (Civitavecchia) on Norwegian Epic and Norwegian Getaway.Oceania Cruises- Oceania Cruises will restart cruise operations with Marina in August, resuming her originally published voyage schedule commencing on August 29, 2021 in Copenhagen.Regent Seven Seas Cruises- Regent Seven Seas Cruises will return to sailing with Seven Seas Splendor cruising from the U.K. beginning September 11, 2021. The voyage will also mark the resumption of Seven Seas Splendor’s inaugural season, with the ship having only completed two cruises with guests after being christened in February 2020. In parallel, the Company submitted a proposal to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) on April 5, 2021, outlining its plan to restart cruising from U.S. ports beginning July 4th and requesting the CDC lift the Conditional Sail Order (“CSO”). The Company’s comprehensive plan is consistent with the CDC’s updated travel guidance for a fully vaccinated onboard population and includes the Company’s multi-layered SailSAFE health and safety program which extends well beyond the protocols of the travel, leisure and hospitality sectors, all of which have already reopened. The Company strongly believes that by requiring mandatory vaccinations for all guests and crew on initial voyages, in addition to comprehensive preventative protocols, the plan exceeds the intent of the CDC’s CSO and would accelerate the path to resume cruising while allowing for the CDC to reallocate resources to competing public health priorities. The Company remains actively engaged in discussions with the CDC regarding recently issued and modified technical guidelines and the incorporation of vaccines into the CSO. As valuable time goes by, given the lead time needed to stand up a ship and the need for an acceptable and definitive agreement with the CDC, a potential mid-summer restart from U.S. ports could be in jeopardy. Booking Environment and Outlook Bookings have been strong for future periods resulting in an elongated booking window as guests book further into the future, despite reduced sales and marketing investments and a travel agency industry that has not been at full strength for months. During the first quarter 2021, overall bookings, net of cancellations, were more than double the volumes during the prior quarter. 2022 booking and pricing trends are very positive driven by strong pent up demand. The Company is experiencing robust future demand across all brands with the overall cumulative booked position for the first half of 2022 meaningfully ahead of 2019’s record levels with pricing higher when excluding the dilutive impact of future cruise credits (“FCCs”). As of March 31, 2021, the Company had $1.3 billion of advance ticket sales, including the long-term portion of advance ticket sales, which includes approximately $0.85 billion of FCCs. Liquidity and Financial Action Plan The Company continues to take proactive measures on its financial action plan to conserve cash, control operating and capital expenditures, improve its debt maturity profile and secure additional capital. As of March 31, 2021, the Company’s total debt position was $12.2 billion and the Company’s cash and cash equivalents was $3.5 billion. The Company has taken the following additional actions to enhance its liquidity since December 31, 2020: Raised approximately $1.6 billion, net of underwriting fees, with an equity offering of approximately 53 million ordinary shares in March 2021. Approximately $1 billion of proceeds were used to repurchase the L Catterton exchangeable notes due 2026. This repurchase allowed the Company to reduce debt and future interest expense while generating incremental liquidity of approximately $530 million with limited additional dilution, as the vast majority of shares issued were already reserved for the L Catterton notes.Issued $1.1 billion of senior unsecured notes consisting of $575 million of 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (tack-on to $850 million offering in December 2020) and $525 million of 6.125% senior unsecured notes due 2028. Proceeds were used in part to fully repay the Norwegian Jewel and Pride of America credit facilities which were to mature in 2022 and generated approximately $650 million of incremental liquidity. Amended all export credit agency backed credit agreements to defer approximately $680 million of amortization payments through March 31, 2022 and secured covenant waivers and suspensions through December 31, 2022. Deferred certain newbuild-related payments of approximately €270 million through June 30, 2022.Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility to defer approximately $70 million of certain amortization payments due prior to June 30, 2022 and suspend the testing of certain financial covenants through December 31, 2022. The Company's monthly average cash burn for the first quarter 2021 was in line with prior guidance at approximately $190 million, or approximately $170 million per month excluding previously disclosed non-recurring debt modification costs. The Company paid approximately $50 million of one-time debt deferral and modification costs and fees in the first quarter of 2021 as a result of successful debt deferrals and covenant waivers and suspensions, which combined with newbuild payment extensions, have resulted in approximately $1 billion of additional liquidity through the first quarter 2022. For the second quarter of 2021, the Company expects the average cash burn rate to be approximately $190 million per month, as it prepares for a return to service this summer. Cash burn rates include ongoing ship operating expenses, administrative operating expenses, interest expense, taxes, debt deferral fees and expected non-newbuild capital expenditures and exclude cash refunds of customer deposits as well as cash inflows from new and existing bookings, newbuild related capital expenditures and other working capital changes. Future cash burn rate estimates also exclude unforeseen expenses. The first quarter 2021 cash burn rate and second quarter 2021 estimate also reflect the deferral of debt amortization and newbuild related payments. “We completed several strategic capital markets transactions in the quarter, raising over $1 billion of incremental liquidity and further extending our debt maturity profile. This included the opportunistic repurchase of the L Catterton senior exchangeable notes which allowed us to proactively manage our balance sheet, reduce debt and unlock additional value for our shareholders,” said Mark A. Kempa, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. “As we prepare for our imminent resumption of cruising this summer, we will continue to balance our cash needs to maximize financial flexibility and position us well for an extended recovery period.” First Quarter 2021 Results GAAP net loss was $(1.4) billion or EPS of $(4.16) compared to net loss of $(1.9) billion or EPS of $(8.80) in the prior year. The Company reported Adjusted Net Loss of $(668.6) million or Adjusted EPS of $(2.03) in 2021 which included $701.6 million of adjustments primarily consisting of expenses related to losses on extinguishment and modifications of debt largely related to the repurchase of the L Catterton exchangeable notes. This compares to Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS of $(211.3) million and $(0.99), respectively, in 2020. Revenue decreased to $3.1 million compared to $1.2 billion in 2020 due to the complete suspension of voyages in the quarter. Total cruise operating expense decreased 79.8% in 2021 compared to 2020. In 2021, cruise operating expenses were primarily related to crew costs, including salaries, food and other travel costs, fuel, and other ongoing costs such as insurance and ship maintenance. Fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges decreased to $590 from $614 in 2020. The Company reported fuel expense of $42.6 million in the period. Interest expense, net was $824.4 million in 2021 compared to $68.9 million in 2020. The increase in interest expense reflects losses on extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs of $674.0 million primarily related to the repurchase of the L Catterton senior exchangeable notes, as well as additional debt outstanding at higher interest rates, partially offset by lower LIBOR. Other income (expense), net was income of $27.2 million in 2021 compared to income of $5.8 million in 2020. In 2021, the income primarily related to gains on fuel swaps not designated as hedges of $22.0 million and foreign currency exchange. 2021 Outlook As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, while the Company cannot estimate the impact on its business, financial condition or near- or longer-term financial or operational results with certainty, it will report a net loss for the second quarter ending June 30, 2021 and expects to report a net loss until the Company is able to resume regular voyages. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had hedged approximately 61%, 37% and 15% of its total projected metric tons of fuel consumption for the remainder of 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The following table provides amounts hedged and price per barrel of heavy fuel oil (“HFO”) which is hedged utilizing U.S. Gulf Coast 3% (“USGC”) and marine gas oil (“MGO”) which is hedged utilizing Gasoil. Remainder of 202120222023% of HFO Consumption Hedged130%15%0%Average USGC Price / Barrel$46.27$48.36N/A% of MGO Consumption Hedged86%155%25%Average Gasoil Price / Barrel$81.45$70.00$67.45 (1)These derivatives were de-designated for accounting purposes in the fourth quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 2021 but still represent economic hedges and may be re-designated in the future. Anticipated total capital expenditures for second quarter 2021 are approximately $90 million which includes health and safety investments. The Company is not providing total capital expenditure guidance for full year 2021 or future years at this time given the uncertain and evolving current environment. However, after newbuild-related payment deferrals the Company’s anticipated expenditures related to ship construction contracts were $0.3 billion, $1.6 billion and $2.4 billion for the years ending December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The Company has export credit financing in place for the anticipated expenditures related to ship construction contracts of $0.2 billion, $0.8 billion and $1.8 billion for the years ending December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The impacts of COVID-19 on the shipyards where the Company’s ships are under construction, or will be constructed, have resulted in some minor delays in ship deliveries, and the impact of COVID-19 could result in additional delays in ship deliveries in the future, which may be prolonged. Interest Expense, net is expected to be approximately $150 million for the second quarter 2021 and approximately $600 million for full year 2021, excluding losses on extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs. Depreciation and Amortization is expected to be approximately $170 million for the second quarter 2021 and approximately $700 million for full year 2021. Conference Call The Company has scheduled a conference call for Thursday, May 6, 2021 at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss first quarter 2021 results and provide a business update. A link to the live webcast along with a slide presentation can be found on the Company’s Investor Relations website at www.nclhltdinvestor.com.

Term Loan A Facility. The senior secured term loan A facility having an outstanding principal amount of approximately $1.5 billion as of March 31, 2021. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Net Cruise Cost, Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS, to enable us to analyze our performance. See “Terminology” for the definitions of these and other non-GAAP financial measures. We utilize Net Cruise Cost and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel to manage our business on a day-to-day basis. In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income, we believe changes in Net Cruise Cost and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance. As a result of our voluntary suspension of sailings during the first three months of 2021, we did not have any Capacity Days in those periods. Accordingly, we have not presented herein per Capacity Day data for the three months ended March 31, 2021. As our business includes the sourcing of passengers and deployment of vessels outside of the U.S., a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, particularly British pound, Canadian dollar, euro and Australian dollar, which are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. In order to monitor results excluding these fluctuations, we calculate certain non-GAAP measures on a Constant Currency basis, whereby current period revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars using currency exchange rates of the comparable period. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP measures on both a reported and Constant Currency basis is useful in providing a more comprehensive view of trends in our business. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as a supplemental financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure in determining our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business, such as sales growth, operating costs, marketing, general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not a defined term under GAAP nor is it intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income, as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments. In addition, Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain amounts and are used to supplement GAAP net income and EPS. We use Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS as key performance measures of our earnings performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparison to our historical performance. In addition, management uses Adjusted EPS as a performance measure for our incentive compensation. The amounts excluded in the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures may vary from period to period; accordingly, our presentation of Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS, may not be indicative of future adjustments or results. For example, for the three months ended March 31, 2020, we incurred $1.6 billion related to impairment losses. We included this as an adjustment in the reconciliation of Adjusted Net Loss since the expenses are not representative of our day-to-day operations however, this adjustment did not occur and is not included in the comparative period presented within this release. You are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating our non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons we consider our non-GAAP financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation. Our non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other companies. Please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below.

Additionally, many of these risks and uncertainties are currently amplified by and will continue to be amplified by, or in the future may be amplified by, the COVID-19 pandemic. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks. There may be additional risks that we consider immaterial or which are unknown.
