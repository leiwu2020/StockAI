The insurance broker has agreed to sell its U.S. retirement and retiree health exchange units for $1.4 billion in the latest move.

Aon’s U.S. retirement business includes retirement consulting and pension administration operations. It will sell the unit to private equity firm Aquiline, which has $6.4 billion in assets under management and invests in businesses across financial services, technology, business services, and healthcare.

Aon’s retiree health exchange unit serves employers and their retirees and was the first retiree exchange to meet the National Council on Aging (NCOA) standard. Aon will sell the unit to Alight, a technology firm whose clients include 70% of the Fortune 100 companies. 

Aon decided to sell these businesses to address antitrust concerns that U.S. regulators raised over its proposed merger with Willis. 

“Aon and Willis Towers Watson continue to work toward obtaining regulatory approval in all relevant jurisdictions,” Aon said in a statement.

Previously, Aon announced the divestiture of its retirement and investment business in Germany, and Willis agreed to sell its Willis Re unit. (See Willis Towers Watson stock analysis on TipRanks)

Aon and Willis are counting on their merger to drive revenue growth and boost profitability. They are expecting $800 million in cost synergies, including the divestiture of earmarked assets. (See AON PLC stock analysis on TipRanks)

Wells Fargo analyst Elyse Greenspan recently reiterated a Buy rating on Aon stock and raised the price target to $287 from $275. The analyst’s new price target suggests 14.11% upside potential. 

In reaffirming the bullish rating, Greenspan noted Aon’s strong first-quarter results, optimistic organic outlook, and the confirmation of $800 million in cost savings in the Willis deal.

Consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 2 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $261.80 implies 4.09% upside potential to current levels.

AON scores a 9 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

In addition to 80% of respondents reporting data as their top concern in the transition to a Net Zero economy, difficulty in making quantitative assessments (75%) and insufficient expertise in the actions required (62%) were also revealed as major challenges. Conducted as part of Willis Towers Watson’s Climate Risk and Financial Stewardship Summit, the survey polled 122 organisations including global banks, insurers, wealth and asset managers to gain fresh insights on progress made to assess and manage the impact of climate risk on their business. Looking across the same five-year timeframe, few organisations who took part in the survey expect the level of risk associated with climate change to diminish, with more respondents (40%) predicting today’s level of risk facing their business will escalate over time. With the pace of change far behind what is needed to keep global temperatures from exceeding 1.5°C of pre-industrial levels, survey respondents said that implementing a strategy to achieve Net Zero is the most common challenge to making this commitment (43%), followed by a lack of tools or data (32%). In addition to future climate-related challenges facing the financial sector over the next five years, the survey looked at issues senior decision makers are having to deal with right now. Respondents cited transition (75%), reputational (63%) and social responsibility (57%) risks their organisations are prioritising today in order to bridge the gap and achieve Net Zero emissions. Rowan Douglas, Head of Willis Towers Watson’s Climate and Resilience Hub, said: “Future climate risks are unprecedented and systemic, and the magnitude of the challenge is so huge and the moment so late that every lever is being explored to turn economies to meet the Paris targets. While the financial sector is well placed to take a lead, climate-related risk not only needs to be integrated into day-to-day risk management but also to steer the whole economic transition to a low-carbon and resilient future.” Research from Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) reveals the extent to which further action across company value chains is required, with nearly half (49%) of the world’s 500 biggest companies yet to conduct any analysis of how their portfolio impacts the climate. This is despite portfolio emissions of global financial institutions being on average over 700 times larger than direct emissions, according to CDP data. Douglas said: “We are seeing an evolution in what Net Zero finance means for the financial sector and its stewardship role in a whole economy transition towards a climate resilient future. Meanwhile pressure from ambitious new climate targets and scrutiny from central banks, regulators, investors and the wider public continues to increase. To continue to thrive, financial institutions will need to adapt and align their portfolios with a Net Zero carbon world.” The Climate Risk and Financial Stewardship Summit also follows the recent launch of Climate Transition Pathways, Willis Towers Watson’s accreditation framework that is designed to provide insurers with a consistent approach to identifying organisations that have robust transition plans aligned to the Paris Agreement and science-based targets for reducing global emissions.

The global professional services firm will sell the unit to U.K.-based consultancy firm Lane Clark & Peacock LLP (LCP). The sell-off will resolve concerns raised by the European Commission about the markets in which Aon and Willis Towers Watson, a global advisory company, operate. The two companies are seeking regulatory approval in all relevant jurisdictions, including the U.S. According to Aon’s CEO Greg Case, the divestment affirms Aon's commitment to closing the proposed merger with Willis Towers Watson.

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Hold based on 2 Buy, 3 Hold, and 1 Sell ratings. The average analyst price target of $259 implies 1.49% upside potential to current levels.

The Emerging Trends in Health Care Survey found that employer interest in offering voluntary benefits has been burgeoning, with 94% of employers finding voluntary benefits to be important to their employee value proposition and Total Rewards strategy three years from now, compared with just 36% of employers deeming them to be important in 2018. “Employers view voluntary benefits as a cost-effective way to offer employees a wide range of benefit options that best meet their needs,” said Lydia Jilek, senior director, Voluntary Benefits Solutions, Willis Towers Watson. “The pandemic has given rise to an increase in benefits that protect employees against big hospital bills and loss of income, and provide personal protection.” Survey identifies top five fastest growing benefits As employers face a different landscape, they are proactively expanding their voluntary benefits to address new trends and better meet the needs of a diverse workforce, especially those affected by the pandemic. The top five fastest growing benefits are: Voluntary benefitCurrently offered Will offer by 2022 or beyondPercentage point changeIdentify theft53%78%+25%Hospital indemnity42%65%+23%Pet insurance47%69%+22%Critical illness57%76%+19%Group legal58%75%+17% The survey also found that the following voluntary offerings are among the most widespread benefits, services and perks that employers currently offer or are planning to offer over the next two years: Financial planning/counseling through an existing vendor (93%)Tuition reimbursement programs (88%)Telephonic financial planning/counseling (77%)Onsite fitness center (54%)Backup childcare (48%)Elder care (44%) “Our research shows that employees are craving more voluntary and flexible benefits,” said Jilek. “Employers are supplementing existing core benefits with more personalized benefits to provide additional ways to support their employees’ overall wellbeing and enhance the perceived value of their benefit offerings — including adding voluntary benefits to the core benefits administration flow.”About the surveyA total of 446 employers participated in the 2021 Emerging Trends in Health Care Survey, which was conducted between February 23 and March 12, 2021. Among those, 238 employers, who employ 3.7 million workers, responded to the voluntary benefits section of the survey.

It is claimed that the staff who quit to join Howden Group printed off thousands of pages of commercially sensitive information before they left former employer Guy Carpenter, owned by American insurance juggernaut Marsh & McLennan. Bradley Maltese, a former executive at JLT Re, led the walkout of 31 staff. JLT was bought by Marsh McLennan in 2019 in a deal worth $5.6bn (£4bn), with some of its divisions folded into Guy Carpenter. Guy Carpenter and Marsh Services launched legal action against Mr Maltese alongside Vijay Mavani, Molly Wyatt, William Abbott and Gayle Scott as well as Howden Insurance Brokers and Howden Group Services Limited, according to High Court filings. It is alleged that four of the defecting group accessed commercially sensitive information in the weeks before they resigned. An interim hearing took place on Apr 30. Mr Howden oversees one of London’s largest privately-owned insurance empires. Although the family name is steeped in insurance – his ancestors formed a brokerage to insure the transportation of precious materials from India – he started what is now the Howden Broking with “three staff and a dog” in a small office in the City in 1994. Howden Group Holdings now employs 8,500 people globally and manages insurance premiums of more than £10bn annually. Guy Carpenter’s history can be traced back to the early 20th century and the southern states of America. Mr Carpenter’s eponymous business initially focused on insuring harvested cotton before he met fellow brokers Henry Marsh and Donald McLennan during a transatlantic crossing in 1923 and merged his business with theirs. The legal row follows a series of similar wrangles in the US amid a wave of insurance deal making. Guy Carpenter is on the receiving end of a staff poaching case in the US. The reinsurance division of Willis Towers Watson launched legal action in April after more than 20 employees from its Latin American team resigned to join Guy Carpenter. Willis Towers Watson agreed to merge with Aon in March 2020. The tie-up, worth £21.5bn, remains subject to regulatory clearances. Guy Carpenter and Howden declined to comment.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ea2fc752ff1a1a695d74e831956378db2c87496fd00a4014dc6a47841f19e301

The working group, which was established in March 2021, will actively evaluate opportunities in the public/private equity space. In its recent paper, titled “Institutional allocation to private equity,” Willis Towers Watson has shown that while there are strong structural tailwinds to support the continuing rise of private equity in institutional portfolios, the private equity industry itself needs to evolve more actively the way in which it structures its investments in order to fully capture the growth potential. One of the focus areas for Willis Towers Watson’s working group is the potential for a new type of passive, or beta, offering within private equity that allows asset owners to access and hold these investments in a cost-effective way. Since many private businesses are already well established with strong management in place and strong cash flows, the working group believes those businesses are well positioned to compound earnings over a longer time horizon than current structures allow. Furthermore, Willis Towers Watson is challenging private equity managers to take additional steps to improve their environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards. As part of this effort, it has developed a set of guiding principles to help them formulate their own frameworks, including assisting them to report on the carbon emissions being generated by their investments as a first step on a route toward net zero. “What we currently have within the private equity space is a model that hasn’t changed in the past few decades,” said Andrew Brown, head of Private Equity Research at Willis Towers Watson. “While that structure has performed well over this period, we are increasingly seeing capital moving away from defined benefit pension schemes into defined contribution, so there is a need to innovate in order to identify a structure that enables a wider investor base to access opportunities. “This could mean relooking entirely at the way that some private equity funds are structured. For example, specific fund terms can mean that private equity managers may be under pressure to sell out of investments prematurely in order to facilitate further fundraising, whereas long-dated funds and evergreen structures could be a way of mitigating the need to do so. This could facilitate the creation of a form of ‘buy and maintain’ private equity that may better suit an investor with a longer-term investment horizon.” About Willis Towers Watson Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ: WLTW) is a leading global advisory, broking and solutions company that helps clients around the world turn risk into a path for growth.

Working with independent third-party groups including Volans, a consultancy responsible for the Bankers for Net Zero initiative, and the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI), a global investment organization committed to climate resilience, the CTP governance committee is being created. In their role as committee members, they will be responsible for creating industry-specific solutions to be rolled-out over the coming months. They will utilize the Assessment for Low Carbon Transition (ACT) methodology and map the output to a robust accreditation model to review business commitments to principles aligned to the Paris Agreement and science-based targets consistent with reducing global emissions to help companies move to a net-zero carbon environment. Organisations meeting these principals and achieving accreditation will have the opportunity to access insurance capacity and capital to support their orderly transition and help them meet their low-carbon commitments. Mark Carney, UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance and the Prime Minister’s Finance Adviser for COP26, said, “To achieve net zero we need a whole economy transition - every company, bank, insurer and investor will have to adjust their business models, develop credible plans for the transition and implement them. As insurers take steps to align their underwriting activities with the transition, companies will increasingly need to display that they have the right plans or risk losing access to insurance. Willis Towers Watson’s work to develop tools to assess companies’ transition plans is a valuable contribution to this process to ensure that every professional financial decision takes climate change into account.” Rowan Douglas, Head of the Climate and Resilience Hub at Willis Towers Watson said, “To ensure that organisations in high-carbon industries transition effectively, in line with what the science​ indicates is needed, they require robust transition plans and the ability to execute successfully against these. By incubating Climate Transition Pathways (CTP), we are helping lead the industry in ensuring these organisations are supported through an orderly transition and can continue to access insurance and benefit from a greater level of certainty around the future availability of risk capacity, helping them deliver a more sustainable future.” Sean Kidney, CEO, CBI said, “Our climate and environmental challenges are extraordinary. Responding to those, and to consumer and regulatory pressure, all businesses are reviewing their sustainable credentials. They need tools to help them do so. We are delighted to be collaborating with Willis Towers Watson and be part of the Governance Committee which will pioneer Climate Transition Pathways and provide a standard which will help businesses move to a more sustainable future.” More information on Climate Transition Pathways can be found at www.climatetransitionpathways.com.

We delivered revenue growth, meaningful margin expansion and strong earnings-per-share growth. Our results reflect both increased demand for our solutions, as well as our sustained focus on profitable growth. We continue to build upon our solid foundation and believe we are well-positioned to continue driving value for all our stakeholders. As always, I would like to thank all of our colleagues for their tremendous efforts this past quarter in support of our clients and each other.” ____________1 The revenue amounts included in this release are presented on a U.S. GAAP basis except where stated otherwise. The segment discussion is on an organic basis. First Quarter Company Highlights Revenue was $2.59 billion for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 5% (1% increase constant currency and 4% increase organic) as compared to $2.47 billion for the same period in the prior year. Income from operations for the first quarter was $452 million, or 17.5% of revenue, an increase of 290 basis points compared to the first quarter of the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $579 million, or 22.4% of revenue, an increase of 110 basis points compared to the first quarter of the prior year. Net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the first quarter of 2021 was $733 million, an increase of 140% from $305 million for the prior-year first quarter. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $5.63 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.64. Net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2021 included pre-tax $24 million of transaction and integration expenses related to the pending business combination with Aon plc. The U.S. GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 11.5%, and the adjusted income tax rate for the quarter used in calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share was 20.5%. Net income for the first quarter of 2021 was $736 million, or 28.4% of revenue, an increase from net income of $313 million, or 12.7% of revenue for the prior-year first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2021 was $730 million, or 28.2% of revenue, an increase from Adjusted EBITDA of $680 million, or 27.6% of revenue. The first quarter is seasonally strong due to the renewal periods for some lines of business. Cash flows used in operating activities were $128 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to cash flows from operating activities of $23 million for the prior-year first quarter. Free cash outflow for the quarters ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 was $165 million and $43 million, respectively. The decrease in year-over-year free cash flow was due to net legal settlement payments of approximately $185 million for the previously-announced Stanford and Willis/Towers Watson merger settlements and higher incentive compensation and benefit-related items of approximately $180 million. During the quarter ended March 31, 2021, the Company had no share repurchase activity. Risks and Uncertainties Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic The extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact our business and financial position will depend on future developments, which are difficult to predict, including the severity and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the types of measures imposed by governmental authorities to contain the virus or address its impact and the duration of those actions and measures. We continue to expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively impact our revenue and operating results for 2021. During 2020 and through the first quarter of 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on revenue growth, particularly in our businesses that are discretionary in nature, but otherwise it generally did not have a material impact on our overall results. Some of our discretionary, project-based businesses saw a reduction in demand, and additional negative impacts on our revenue and operating results may lag behind the developments thus far related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In light of the effects on our own business operations and those of our clients, suppliers and other third parties with whom we interact, the Company has considered, and will continue to consider, the impact of COVID-19 on our business, as appropriate, taking into account our business resilience and continuity plans, financial modeling and stress testing of liquidity and financial resources. For additional information on the risks posed by COVID-19, see additional disclosures in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. Segment Highlights Human Capital & Benefits The Human Capital & Benefits (HCB) segment had revenue of $875 million, an increase of 3% (flat constant currency and flat organic) from $850 million in the prior-year first quarter. On an organic basis, Retirement revenue was flat with growth in Great Britain driven by funding and Guaranteed Minimum Pension (“GMP”) equalization work, offset by a decline in North America related to lower de-risking activity. Health and Benefits revenue was flat as continued expansion of our local portfolios and global benefits management appointments outside of North America was offset by a decline in North America due to prior-year book sales. Talent and Rewards revenue declined nominally with growth in our rewards offerings offset by lower project activity in our traditional survey and communications and change management offerings. Technology and Administrative Solutions revenue increased due to new project and client activity in Great Britain. The HCB segment had an operating margin of 25.2%, as compared to 25.0% for the prior-year first quarter. Corporate Risk & Broking The Corporate Risk & Broking (CRB) segment had revenue of $810 million, an increase of 10% (5% increase constant currency and 5% increase organic) from $739 million in the prior-year first quarter. On an organic basis, International and Great Britain led the segment with new business generation primarily in natural resources and Finex insurance lines. North America revenue also grew with strong renewals across all regions, again led by Finex. Revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in Western Europe, which primarily stemmed from challenges related to senior staff departures. The CRB segment had an operating margin of 20.0%, as compared to 17.2% for the prior-year first quarter. Investment, Risk & Reinsurance The Investment, Risk & Reinsurance (IRR) segment had revenue of $605 million, a decrease of 2% (5% decrease constant currency and 4% increase organic) from $615 million in the prior-year first quarter. On an organic basis, most lines of business contributed to the growth. Reinsurance growth was driven by new business wins and favorable renewal factors. An uptick in demand for advisory work led the revenue growth in both our Investment business and Insurance Consulting and Technology business, which was further aided by increased software sales. The growth was partially offset by a decline in Wholesale’s revenue as a result of headwinds across coverage lines coupled with a strategic shift in its operating model. The IRR segment had an operating margin of 47.9%, as compared to 45.1% for the prior-year first quarter. In September 2020, the Company sold its Max Matthiessen business, and the sale of Miller, its wholesale insurance broking subsidiary, was completed on March 1, 2021 (see additional disclosures in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021). Benefits Delivery & Administration The Benefits Delivery & Administration (BDA) segment had revenue of $287 million, an increase of 24% (24% increase constant currency and 23% increase organic) from $231 million in the prior-year first quarter. BDA’s organic revenue increase was led by Individual Marketplace, primarily by TRANZACT, which generated revenue of $148 million in the first quarter with strong growth in Medicare Advantage sales. Benefits Outsourcing revenue also increased, driven by its expanded client base. The BDA segment had an operating margin of 2.5%, as compared to negative 4.7% for the prior-year first quarter.

It will be held on Thursday, April 29, 2021, beginning at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time, and can be accessed via the Internet at www.willistowerswatson.com.

Willis Towers Watson Non-GAAP Measures In order to assist readers of our consolidated financial statements in understanding the core operating results that Willis Towers Watson’s management uses to evaluate the business and for financial planning, we present the following non-GAAP measures: (1) Constant Currency Change, (2) Organic Change, (3) Adjusted Operating Income/Margin, (4) Adjusted EBITDA/Margin, (5) Adjusted Net Income, (6) Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, (7) Adjusted Income Before Taxes, (8) Adjusted Income Taxes/Tax Rate and (9) Free Cash Flow. We believe that these measures are relevant and provide useful information widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in our industry to provide a baseline for evaluating and comparing our operating performance, and in the case of free cash flow, our liquidity results. Within these measures referred to as ‘adjusted’, we adjust for significant items which will not be settled in cash, or which we believe to be items that are not core to our current or future operations. Some of these items may not be applicable for the current quarter, however they are expected to be part of our full-year results. These items include the following: Restructuring costs and transaction and integration expenses - Management believes it is appropriate to adjust for restructuring costs and transaction and integration expenses when they relate to a specific significant program with a defined set of activities and costs that are not expected to continue beyond a defined period of time, or significant acquisition-related transaction expenses. We believe the adjustment is necessary to present how the Company is performing, both now and in the future when the incurrence of these costs will have concluded.Gains and losses on disposals of operations - Adjustment to remove the gain or loss resulting from disposed operations.Pension settlement and curtailment gains and losses - Adjustment to remove significant pension settlement and curtailment gains and losses to better present how the Company is performing.Abandonment of long-lived asset - Adjustment to remove the depreciation expense resulting from internally-developed software that was abandoned prior to being placed into service.Provisions for significant litigation - We will include provisions for litigation matters which we believe are not representative of our core business operations. These amounts are presented net of insurance recovery receivables.Tax effect of the CARES Act - Relates to the incremental tax expense impact, primarily from the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (“BEAT”), generated from electing certain income tax provisions of the CARES Act. Tax effects of internal reorganization - Relates to the U.S. income tax expense resulting from the completion of internal reorganizations of the ownership of certain businesses that reduced the investments held by our U.S.-controlled subsidiaries. We evaluate our revenue on an as reported (U.S. GAAP), constant currency and organic basis. We believe presenting constant currency and organic information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our comparable results, consistent with how we evaluate our performance internally. We consider Constant Currency Change, Organic Change, Adjusted Operating Income/Margin, Adjusted EBITDA/Margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted Income Before Taxes, Adjusted Income Taxes/Tax Rate and Free Cash Flow to be important financial measures, which are used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating and liquidity results against our competitors. These non-GAAP measures are important in illustrating what our comparable operating and liquidity results would have been had we not incurred transaction-related and non-recurring items. Our non-GAAP measures and their accompanying definitions are presented as follows: Constant Currency Change – Represents the year-over-year change in revenue excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. To calculate this impact, the prior year local currency results are first translated using the current year monthly average exchange rates. The change is calculated by comparing the prior year revenue, translated at the current year monthly average exchange rates, to the current year as reported revenue, for the same period. We believe constant currency measures provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to performance by excluding the effects that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on period-over-period comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets. Organic Change – Excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as described above and the period-over-period impact of acquisitions and divestitures on current-year revenue. We believe that excluding transaction-related items from our U.S. GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to our investors, and it is important in illustrating what our core operating results would have been had we not included these transaction-related items, since the nature, size and number of these translation-related items can vary from period to period. Adjusted Operating Income/Margin – Income from operations adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results. Adjusted operating income margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income by revenue. We consider adjusted operating income/margin to be important financial measures, which are used internally to evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors. Adjusted EBITDA/Margin – Net Income adjusted for provision for income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, gains and losses on disposals of operations and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by revenue. We consider adjusted EBITDA/margin to be important financial measures, which are used internally to evaluate and assess our core operations, to benchmark our operating results against our competitors and to evaluate and measure our performance-based compensation plans. Adjusted Net Income – Net Income Attributable to Willis Towers Watson adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, gains and losses on disposals of operations and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and the related tax effect of those adjustments and the tax effects of internal reorganizations. This measure is used solely for the purpose of calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share – Adjusted Net Income divided by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock, diluted. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors. Adjusted Income Before Taxes – Income from operations before income taxes adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, gains and losses on disposals of operations and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results. Adjusted income before taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate. Adjusted Income Taxes/Tax Rate – Provision for income taxes adjusted for taxes on certain items of amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, gains and losses on disposals of operations, the tax effects of internal reorganizations, and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results, divided by adjusted income before taxes. Adjusted income taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate. Management believes that the adjusted income tax rate presents a rate that is more closely aligned to the rate that we would incur if not for the reduction of pre-tax income for the adjusted items and the tax effects of internal reorganizations, which are not core to our current and future operations. Free Cash Flow – Cash flows from operating activities less cash used to purchase fixed assets and software for internal use. Free Cash Flow is a liquidity measure and is not meant to represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow presents the core operating performance and cash-generating capabilities of our business operations. These non-GAAP measures are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the information contained within our condensed consolidated financial statements. Reconciliations of these measures are included in the accompanying tables with the following exception. The Company does not reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, due to variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections and/or certain information not being ascertainable or accessible; and because not all of the information, such as foreign currency impacts necessary for a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, is available to the Company without unreasonable efforts. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. The Company provides non-GAAP financial measures that it believes will be achieved, however it cannot accurately predict all of the components of the adjusted calculations and the U.S. GAAP measures may be materially different than the non-GAAP measures.

The Emerging Trends in Health Care Survey found that four-fifths of employers will take steps to promote DEI in their workplace culture and policies over the next three years compared with just 55% that took measures over the past three years. Additionally, seven in 10 employers indicated they would promote DEI-related aspects of their benefit programs (72%) and wellbeing programs (69%) over the next three years, more than double those that did so the past three years. “Employers recognize the need for greater diversity and inclusion in the workplace and are taking steps to address equity and access in their benefit programs,” said Rachael McCann, senior director, Health and Benefits, Willis Towers Watson. “By shifting benefit program discussions from inclusivity to equitable health and wealth outcomes, employers will be able to identify specific areas for improvement — and that often leads to a focus on access, affordability and quality.” Organizations are taking actions around the following benefit plans, programs and policies to align with their DEI objectives: Half of respondents (50%) have acted on their maternity benefits, family planning and fertility programs; another 33% plan to do so this year or are considering doing so in the next two years.Just under half of respondents (46%) have acted on transgender benefits; another 30% plan to do so this year or are considering doing so in the next two years. Over half of respondents have addressed employee resource groups (55%) and leave of absence programs (53%); about one in four plan to do so this year or are considering doing so in the next two years. Social determinants of health initiatives gain momentum More employers think social determinants of health (SDoH) — the non-medical factors that influence health outcomes — are integral to evaluating benefits and wellbeing program effectiveness and will factor significantly in the future. More than eight in 10 employers (83%) believe SDoH will be essential to their organizations’ health and wellbeing strategies over the next three years. Currently, only two-thirds of employers (67%) consider SDoH important. The survey found more employers are implementing programs that support LGBT+ individuals, gaps in care, and broad physical and emotional wellbeing. The survey found many employers are examining key health care indicators through the SDoH lens with many more expected to do so: Nearly four in 10 respondents (37%) have conducted an assessment to examine access to virtual care among various employee groups; another 31% are either planning or considering doing so by 2023.Over one-third (34%) have evaluated the quality of the SDoH factors within their preventive care and screening visits; another 32% are planning or considering doing so in the next few years. Nearly one-third (32%) have examined health care utilization by key conditions; another 37% are planning or considering doing so in the next few years.More than a quarter (27%) have evaluated the affordability of benefits (relative to salary); another 29% are planning or considering doing so in the next few years. “The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated already existing health disparities. Yet, it has also helped employers to understand the need to address social determinants of health in their benefit program strategies. By doing all they can to understand the needs of each workforce sector, employers can make it possible for all employees to thrive,” said Julie Stone, managing director, Health and Benefits, Willis Towers Watson. About the surveyA total of 446 employers participated in the 2021 Emerging Trends in Health Care Survey, which was conducted between February 23 and March 12, 2021. Respondents employ 6.3 million workers.

However, the global advisory, broking and solutions company says buyers will continue to face upward pressure on pricing across most lines of business for the remainder of 2021, primarily due to increasing severity of losses that have been the main driver of the hard market. The company offered some positive news for buyers in the report. Property increases are not as steep as predicted last fall. In fact, according to the report, increases are expected to be lower than predicted last fall for 10 lines of insurance and about the same as predicted for almost half the lines. Only a handful of lines are expected to see higher increases — and some of those just slightly higher. The report conveys that the market has become more orderly and predictable, with rates approaching technical adequacy in some lines and sectors, as new capital has entered the marketplace. “With higher rates attracting new entrants and coaxing some capacity to come off the sidelines, rate increases are beginning to decelerate, or at least stop climbing,” said Joe Peiser, global head of Broking, Willis Towers Watson. “It’s still a hard market, but to a large degree, the hard/soft market cycle is — or will soon be — proven again.” The company narrates that a two-tiered market has emerged — one for better risks, one for poorer ones — and anticipates each tier will pay more for insurance in 2021, but those in the better tier will suffer considerably less. While there are wide variations by product line, good risks are finding ease of conditions, including more modest rate increases; others, not so much. Strict underwriting and cautious deployment of capacity on certain risks persist as the underwriting community grapples with systemic changes in the risk landscape. “Because this hard market has been characterized by uncanny underwriting discipline, it’s important for insurance buyers to differentiate themselves into the good tier,” said Peiser. “Buyers and brokers should fight analytics with analytics to differentiate good risks from others in an insurer’s portfolio.” As for specific lines, property rate increases, while still high, offer what passes as a bright spot in the current marketplace: For non-challenged occupancies, predicted increases fell from +15% to +20% in the fall to +5% to +15% now; for challenged occupancies, the range improved from +30% or more to +20% or more. General liability predictions remain at +7.5% to +15%. Casualty excess predictions are slightly less eye-popping than in the fall: from +150% or more for high-hazard buyers and +75% or more for low/moderate hazard buyers, to +100% or more for high-hazard and +50% or more for low/moderate. Workers compensation continues to offer a respite from big increases, with some buyers even coming away with flat renewals. Auto rate increases remain plateaued at +8% to +15%. Directors’ and officers’ liability increases are decelerating, from +20% to +50% for public companies and +10% to +50% for private/nonprofit organizations in the fall to +10% to +40% for public and +5% to +45% for private/nonprofit now. “Risk differentiation always begins with a strong commitment to risk management. We strongly believe that providing exposure data that is both current and developed with rigor paves the way for better renewal outcomes. High-quality data are also a necessary input for updated analytics and modeling,” added Peiser. Key findings: Property: A recent rise in the availability of capacity has created a two-tiered market: one for challenged occupancies and one for non-challenged occupancies. Casualty: The commercial liability marketplace remains challenged; however, recent lead umbrella and excess liability renewal rates have been less volatile, a trend we expect to continue through 2021. Auto liability: Auto liability premium rates and claim payments remain on the rise, with some insureds being forced to amend program structure to manage total cost of risk. Directors’ and officers’: Rates, retentions and terms continue to see upward pressure, but capacity inflow in the public company space is yielding a deceleration of rate increases. Cyber: As insurers continue their strategies to mitigate the financial losses from the significant increase in frequency and severity of ransomware incidents over the past year, they must now also assess how organizations may have been affected by the SolarWinds, Accellion and Microsoft Exchange Server breaches. In an already hardened insurance market, these recent developments are likely to tighten the terms and availability of certain cyber coverage for some organizations, especially for those that cannot demonstrate strong cyber risk controls, culture and overall cyber hygiene.

Research shows that although Chinese capital markets provide diversification benefits and attractive alpha opportunities for global investors, substantial challenges on the sustainable investment (SI) front have made investors cautious at the same time. The Willis Towers Watson (WTW) study shows that by using a total portfolio approach and active management of Chinese assets, investors can gain the long-term diversification and expected return benefits from adding the Chinese assets without a negative impact on their overall sustainability profile. “Sustainable investing is not just about properly integrating ESG-related information for risk management purposes. It is also about recognizing that long-term ESG-related themes, such as climate change, can create return opportunities. China has in recent years emerged as a world leader in funding and developing technologies to combat climate change, and its net-zero pledge will greatly influence economic and climate policies in the decades to come,” said Liang Yin, director in WTW’s Investments research team and China project lead. “Moving forward, we expect China to be a major source of climate change-driven investment opportunities.” Evidence shows that over the past few years China’s SI development has gathered significant positive ESG momentum, which can be a financially significant indicator of strong future returns. The total portfolio approach considers each risk factor in aggregate across the whole portfolio rather than just within each asset class. This framework allows investors to reduce exposure to assets that have negative sustainability characteristics elsewhere in the portfolio and increase allocation to Chinese assets that have better ESG momentum and better overall risk and return potential. Alternatively, increasing exposure to assets that have positive sustainability characteristics, such as investments in climate solutions, can be used to balance the overall sustainability profile. In addition, skilled active management can significantly reduce risk exposures related to poor ESG practices that sometimes can be encountered in China. When selecting investment managers, there needs to be a strong emphasis on their ESG integration and stewardship practices. “We strongly believe that skilled active management should be front and center of any institutional implementation solutions to access China. Given the current state of China’s SI development, we do not recommend a blanket allocation across Chinese assets,” said Paul Colwell, head of Advisory Portfolio Group, Investments Asia, WTW. “Accessing China’s large and rich opportunity while navigating its complex SI landscape can pose a significant governance challenge for many asset owners; however, the benefit of doing so outweighs the risk and incremental costs. Asset owners do not necessarily have to have a presence in China or internal staff who can speak Chinese, but they do need to have well-resourced local partners on whom they can lean when making allocation decisions and selecting managers,” added Liang. Scenario analysis by WTW suggests that Chinese assets may build up to 20% of global investor growth portfolios over the next 10 years. Despite recent progress made by policymakers in opening up China’s domestic capital markets, the average institutional allocation to China remains at a low level of around 5% (of the growth portfolios). China presents a strong investment case, but building exposure to China should be a journey that balances the pace of market improvements with the imperative to achieve diversity in a global portfolio. The research, “China through a sustainable investment lens,” is published in two papers: “Part 1: The case for including China in a sustainability focused portfolio” and “Part 2: Incorporating ESG in portfolio design and implementation considerations.” They can be downloaded here.

We believe that working to achieve net zero by 2050 in our discretionary portfolios is completely consistent with the financial goals we have been given by our clients, as climate change has the potential to impact returns across multiple asset classes. We have already embedded this in our investment process and ultimately in the portfolios we are managing and stewarding. “Being strategically ahead of a net zero transition will, in our opinion, significantly improve risk-adjusted returns for our clients. This will come from two sources: ‘better beta’ due to more effective stewardship and ‘alpha’ as the mispricing of climate issues is resolved. We think that understanding this transition will be one of the biggest sources of alpha across all asset classes and that this alpha opportunity is likely to be greatest in the next few years. We will therefore target pathways to net zero that seek out pricing opportunities while delivering a reduction in emissions of more than 50% between 2015 and 2030, consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. “Measurement of our progress and that of the whole investment industry in stewarding the transition to a net zero and climate-resilient economy is an important issue. There is no single definitive metric that can be used to adequately measure progress, and the data and analytics in the climate space are rapidly evolving. We are therefore investing heavily in leading analytics in this space, including our proprietary Carbon Journey Plan methodology, the ‘impact measurement framework’ that we have developed together with other industry participants via the Thinking Ahead Institute, our acquisition of Acclimatise in December 2020 and the arrival of the energy finance team from the Climate Policy Initiative in January 2021. ”We will also continue to work with our advisory clients to set out and deliver on their own climate-related goals via Carbon Journey Plans, including analytics on how climate change might impact liabilities as well as assets.” In addition to integrating climate risk into its multi-asset investment process, Willis Towers Watson also offers a range of multi-manager funds where sustainable investment is a key part of the investment proposition, which clients can use to help them achieve their sustainable investment goals.

Notes to editors: *This represents a halving of emissions compared to a 2015 baseline, consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. If we started managing the portfolio on a fully discretionary basis after that date or there was a significant change in the nature of the mandate subsequent to 2015, then an appropriate allowance for the shortened timeframe would be made. **As of December 31, 2020 About Willis Towers Watson Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ: WLTW) is a leading global advisory, broking and solutions company that helps clients around the world turn risk into a path for growth.
