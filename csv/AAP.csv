However, shares dropped 1.7% to close at $191.33 on June 2.



In Q1, net sales came in at $3.3 billion, which was slightly above the Street’s estimates of $3.28 billion and jumped 23.4% from the year-ago period.



Adjusted earnings came in at $3.34 per share, beating the consensus estimates of $3.08 per share, and soared 234% year-over-year.



Comparable store sales increased 24.7%. (See Advance Auto Parts stock analysis on TipRanks)



Advance Auto Parts' CFO Jeff Shepherd said, ""We continue to see top-line sales strength in the early weeks of the second quarter of 2021.""



Shepherd further added, ""Through the first four weeks of Q2, our comp sales continue to trend in the mid-teens and on a two-year stack are comparable with our Q1 2021 increase of 15.4%. While we're still anticipating significant volatility throughout the balance of this year due to macro-economic factors, we're again updating our full year guidance to reflect this continued top-line momentum.""



Advance Auto Parts raised full-year 2021 guidance. It now expects net sales to be in the range of $10.4 - $10.6 billion, up from the previous forecast of $10.2-$10.4 billion. Comparable store sales growth is now envisioned in the band of 4% - 6% versus previous expectations of 2%-4%.



Following the Q1 earnings release, Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel assigned a Hold rating on the stock.



Nagel commented, “We look quite favorably upon recent, upbeat trends at AAP and applaud senior management of the chain for continuing to pursue successfully key strategic repositioning efforts, all the while navigating well a challenging and fluid sector and macro backdrop.""



The analyst further added, “We continue to update our financial model for AAP and review recent trends and ongoing initiatives at the chain.”



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 12 Buys versus 3 Holds. The average analyst price target stands at $221.38 and implies upside potential of 15.7% to current levels. Shares have gained 34.4% over the past year.



TipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 100% Bullish on Advance Auto Parts, compared to a sector average of 71%.

Monro (MNRO) announced that Broderick will join the board and will take up the new role, effective from April 5. Robert Mellor has been serving as the company’s interim CEO since Aug. 2020, when Brett Ponton resigned from the CEO position to pursue other opportunities. Mellor will then continue as Monro’s chairman of the board. The company said that Broderick has over 25 years of experience in the aftermarket parts and tire service industry, and has recently served as the executive vice president of merchandising and store operations support at Advance Auto Parts (AAP). Following the new CEO appointment, Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel maintained a Hold rating on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said, “We are encouraged by the ability of MNRO and the company’s board of directors to recruit a seasoned executive with more than two decades of experience in auto parts and other areas of retail to lead the organization.” On Jan. 27, Monro reported lower-than-expected 3Q results, wherein earnings of $0.22 per share fell short of analysts’ estimates of $0.38 per share. Revenues of $284.6 million also missed the consensus estimate of $299.4 million. (See Monro stock analysis on TipRanks) Overall, consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 2 unanimous Holds. The average analyst price target of $62 implies downside potential of about 11.3% to current levels. Shares have gained 41.7% over the past year.
