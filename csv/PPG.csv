The Pennsylvania-based company supplies specialty materials, coatings and paints worldwide.



The company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.94, up from $1.09 in the second quarter last year. However, it missed the Street’s estimates of $2.20.



Quarterly net sales increased 45% year-over-year to $4.4 billion, marginally beating analysts’ expectations of $4.33 billion. Performance Coatings segment’s net sales rose 33% to $2.8 billion, and net sales of Industrial Coatings segment climbed 70% to $1.6 billion.



For the third quarter, the company expects net sales to rise by 21% to 23% year-over-year. It expects to report adjusted EPS between $7.40 and $7.60. (See PPG stock chart on TipRanks)



The Chairman and CEO of PPG, Michael H. McGarry, said, “Overall economic demand growth remains very broad and robust and, as supply conditions normalize, we expect strong sales growth later this year and into next year aided by our technology advantaged products, our diverse geographic and end-use market participation, and continuing recovery from our aerospace business.”



On July 1, Societe Generale analyst Peter Clark maintained a Buy rating on the stock and raised the price target from $168 to $192 (15.8% upside potential). In a research note to investors, the analyst said, “Despite rising input costs, cost discipline and pricing power should ensure operating leverage and continue to drive margins.”



Overall, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus based on 5 Buys and 1 Hold. The average PPG Industries price target of $191.83 implies 15.7% upside potential. The company’s shares have gained 51.5% over the past year.



According to TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, PPG scores an 8 out of 10, suggesting that the stock is likely to outperform market averages.

(PPG) recently announced a quarterly dividend of 59 cents per share, a hike of 9.3% from its previous dividend of 54 cents. The dividend will be paid on September 10, 2021 to shareholders of record as of August 10, 2021.



Following the news, shares of the company appreciated marginally to close at $171.48 in Thursday’s trading session. Based on Thursday’s closing price, the annual dividend yield now stands at 1.4%.



CEO of PPG Michael H. McGarry said, ""The 50-year milestone of annual dividend increases has been achieved by a very limited group of companies, and is a true testament to our company’s legacy of consistently rewarding our shareholders. The increase is also a reflection of the strong confidence that PPG’s Board and management team have in our ability to continue to generate and grow our operating cash flow, which is now enhanced by the five recent acquisitions that we completed."" (See PPG stock chart on TipRanks)



On July 1, Societe Generale analyst Peter Clark reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. The analyst, however, raised the price target from $168 to $192, which implies upside potential of 12% from current levels.



According to Clark, the company’s cost control measures and pricing power is likely to aid its operating leverage and margins.



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 10 Buys and 2 Holds. The average PPG price target of $190 implies upside potential of 10.8% from current levels. 



PPG scores a 9 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations. Shares have gained about 48.8% over the past year.
