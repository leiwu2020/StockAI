It will do the same for a follow-up appointment at Walgreens locations that administer vaccines requiring two shots.The initiative extends an existing arrangement between the nation’s largest app for rides and the second-largest pharmacy chain. Uber and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. began offering free and discounted rides to Walgreens vaccine clinics, aiming to vaccinate essential workers and accelerate distribution. Uber introduced a similar program for some drivers in Puerto Rico last month.The pandemic decimated ride demand over the last year. In recent weeks, those numbers have begun to bounce back as vaccination rates have increased and normal activities are returning. More than a billion vaccine doses have been given globally, over 230 million of them administered in the U.S., according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker.America’s second-largest ride-hailing provider, Lyft Inc., said last year it would provide 60 million rides to and from vaccine sites in low income, uninsured and at-risk communities through an arrangement with Anthem Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and United Way. Lyft later partnered with CVS Health Corp. and the YMCA to reach more people.Uber declined to say when it would facilitate vaccinations outside of the U.S. Sundeep Jain, the chief product officer, acknowledged that India, Brazil and other countries where Uber operates are facing severe outbreaks. “We are aggressively and actively working on partnerships outside of the United States,” Jain said.(Updates with product chief’s comments in the last paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e3d6943eec7b5e724c3b2eb02a9f746fa1340ff8efc54dac8e2d73d85cd4c7f3

The health insurer said the incentive will be in the form of a one-time credit toward medical premiums or a donation to the Anthem Cares Fund that helps support fellow employees in need, at the employees choice. ""Anthem is committed to empowering our associates to live a healthy lifestyle, therefore it was important that we provided an incentive to those who receive the COVID-19 vaccination. I am impressed and grateful for everything our associates have done and continue to do for the customers and communities we serve,"" said Chief Human Resources Officer Leah Stark. There are currently three COVID-19 vaccines that have been granted emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration, two-dose vaccines from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc. , and Johnson & Johnson's one-dose vaccine. Anthem's stock, which was indicated down 0.4% in premarket trading, has rallied 9.7% year to date while the S&P 500 has gained 8.5%.
