The deal could be announced as early as Monday, it said.Platinum Equity, controlled by billionaire Tom Gores, is seeking the deal in anticipation of a rebound in golf as a recreational sport following the pandemic, Reuters said.The Davidson, North Carolina-based company’s Club Car golf, utility and consumer low-speed vehicles unit reported 2020 revenue of $246 million, up 9% from the previous period, according to its Feb. 22 earnings statement. The increase was “driven by continued strength in consumer vehicles, as well as growth in golf and after market product offerings,” according to the statement.An after-hours telephone call to Ingersoll Rand wasn’t answered, and Platinum Equity didn’t immediately respond to an email request for comment.Golf still remains a popular sport even as the outbreak kept people away from courses. Earlier on Sunday, Hideki Matsuyama won the Masters Tournament by one shot, becoming the first Japanese to claim one of the four majors in men’s golf on the lush fairways and manicured greens at Augusta National in Georgia.Platinum Equity last month kicked off a $4 billion debt sale to help fund its acquisition of supply chain company Ingram Micro Inc. amid an up tick in leveraged buyout activity.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=51f1fed8dd06176b15f3818e04817420fca0c832dbe861b1e4836448fb4988ca

The climate control product manufacturer for homes, buildings, and transportation said strong execution and productivity savings fueled quarterly earnings.Trane Technologies’ (TT) adjusted earnings of $1.03 per share jumped 12% year-over-year and came in ahead of the consensus estimate of $0.93 per share. The year-over-year growth reflects a 14% increase in operating income.The company’s adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating margin expanded by 140 basis points and 150 basis points, respectively, due to higher average realized prices and productivity savings.Trane Technologies’ top-line remained flat at $3.18 billion but surpassed analysts’ estimates of $3.08 billion. Bookings improved by 4% year-over-year. The company’s revenue increased 1% year-over-year in the Americas, its largest business segment by sales. However, revenue remained weak in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and in the Asia Pacific regions.Looking ahead, Trane Technologies remains upbeat and expects to report adjusted EPS in the range of $5.30 to $5.50 in 2021, reflecting year-over-year growth of 19% to 23%.The company’s CEO, Mike Lamach, said “Despite ongoing pandemic-related challenges in 2021, we remain confident that we have the fundamental ingredients for another year of resilient financial performance, strong free cash flow and balanced capital deployment that will deliver continued, differentiated returns for shareholders.” (See Trane Technologies stock analysis on TipRanks)Following the earnings results, Cowen & Co. analyst Gautam Khanna maintained a Hold rating on the stock with a price target of $130 (about 13% downside potential). Khanna said, “Q4 results were strong, & initial Q1 guidance (implies near $0.66 vs. Street's $0.54) & C21 guidance ($5.40 midpoint vs. Street's $5.17) are well above Street. These factors should sustain TT's premium valuation.” Overall, the Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 4 Buys, 6 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $153.09 implies upside potential of 2.5% to current levels.
