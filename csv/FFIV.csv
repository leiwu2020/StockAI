Meanwhile, the company reported better-than-expected 1Q results. F5 Networks’ (FFIV) 1Q earnings of $2.59 per share grew 1.6% year-over-year and topped the Street estimates of $2.46 per share. The company's revenues of $626 million rose 10% year-over-year and exceeded analysts' expectations of about $624 million. F5’s CEO François Locoh-Donou said, “Our investments over the last several years have fueled innovation, enhancing our strategic position with customers at a time when they are experiencing explosive application growth, and contributing to our 10% revenue growth in the first quarter.” First-quarter revenue was driven by 70% growth in software sales, 5% growth in systems revenue and 1% growth in global services revenue. As for 2Q, F5 Networks expects earnings in the range of $2.32-$2.44 per share compared to analysts’ expectations of $2.41 per share. However, F5 Networks’ 2Q revenue guidance of $625-645 million came in below the analysts’ forecast of about $621.66 million. (See FFIV stock analysis on TipRanks). On Jan. 25, Cowen & Co. analyst Paul Silverstein raised the stock’s price target to $255 (22.3% upside potential) from $223 and maintained a Buy rating. The analyst believes that F5 Networks’ positive operating leverage should drive double-digit earnings growth over the next several years. Overall, the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on the stock with a Moderate Buy analyst consensus based on 7 Buys and 6 Holds. The average analyst price target of $206.09 implies downside potential of about 1.2% to current levels. That's after shares gained 53.6% over the past year.

Earlier this month, the application services company agreed to buy Volterra for $440 million in cash and another $60 million in deferred consideration.The company's F5+Volterra Edge 2.0 is an enterprise application security platform that aims to address security challenges found in current edge solutions built on content delivery networks.François Locoh-Donou, CEO of F5 (FFIV) said, “I am incredibly excited to welcome Volterra to the F5 family and get to work bringing Edge 2.0—a key part of our Adaptive Applications vision—to customers. Joining forces, we will deliver the enterprise-grade features, including world-class security and scale, that have been missing from the edge until now.”Shares of F5 Networks were up by 1.4% and closed at $207.25 on Jan. 25. The completion of the deal comes as the application services company is scheduled to announce its 1Q FY21 results on Jan. 26.F5 Networks earlier this month raised its sales outlook and announced that it expects its FY21 and FY22 (Horizon 2) revenues to grow at a CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate) of 7% to 8%, up from an earlier CAGR forecast of 6% to 7%. (See FFIV stock analysis on TipRanks)Over the long-term, the company sees revenue growing at double-digit rates compared to a previous forecast of 8% to 9%. F5 Networks expects to generate double-digit non-GAAP growth in EPS (earnings per share) in Horizon 2 and is committed to share repurchases of $1 billion over the next two years. This includes a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program in FY21.Earlier this month, Needham analyst Alex Henderson assigned a Buy rating and set a price target of $235 on the stock. “We think the shift to software and subscription has been understating growth and the shift to application-driven growth from DC [data center] spending- driven sluggishness is a major positive,"" Henderson wrote in a note to investors. ""We think FFIV will re-rate higher by multiple turns as growth accelerates and margins expand.”Overall, analysts are cautiously optimistic about the stock and the consensus is a Moderate Buy with 7 analysts recommending a Buy and 6 analysts suggesting a Hold. The average price target of $206.09 implies 0.6% downside potential to current levels.

company,1610347895,F5 Networks Snaps Up Volterra for $500M to Create an Edge Platform,63473224,https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?650921176,FFIV,Nasdaq,"Application security and delivery company F5 Networks has inked a deal to acquire Volterra, a California-based provider of a distributed cloud services platform for network and secure applications deployment across multi-cloud and the edge. Shares rose 6.8% on Jan. 8 in reaction to the news.F5 (FFIV) is acquiring edge-as-a-service platform Volterra for about $440 million in cash and about $60 million in deferred payment and assumed unvested incentive compensation to founders and employees. Through the addition of Volterra, the company intends to create an edge platform for enterprises and service providers that will be “security-first and app-driven with unlimited scale.”The transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021.With the addition of Volterra, F5 now expects total revenue growth (CAGR) of 7%-8% in what the company calls “Horizon 2” (fiscal 2021-fiscal 2022), up from its previous forecast of an increase of 6%-7%. Also, it anticipates long-term revenue growth of double digits compared to the previous target of 8%-9%. It continues to see double-digit adjusted EPS growth in Horizon 2. (See FFIV stock analysis on TipRanks)The company also stated that it anticipates revenue (preliminary numbers) for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 of $623-$626 million, implying about 10% year-over-year growth driven by a 68% (70% on adjusted basis) jump in software revenue. It expects 1Q adjusted EPS to be at the top-end of its previous guidance of $2.26-$2.38.Needham analyst Alex Henderson boosted his 2020 and 2021 revenue and earnings estimates for F5 following the news of the Volterra acquisition. The 5-star analyst reiterated a Buy rating on F5 and bumped up the price target to $235 from $210. Henderson is optimistic about the Volterra acquisition as he feels that “F5 lacked a true cloud SNaaS (Secure Network as a Service), which limited its market reach.”“This acquisition further drives the DevOps/Coders teams ability to achieve increased agility in application deployment and reduced friction. It should support the strong adoption of NGINX in Kubernetes and micro-services based deployments. It also should help tie these deployments into the more hybrid environments and drive and strengthen demand for F5's BIG-IP platforms,” added Henderson.  Overall, 8 Buys and 5 Holds add up to a Moderate Buy analyst consensus for F5. Shares have risen over 40% over the past 52 weeks and the average price target of $204.10 indicates upside potential of 6.7% from current levels.   Related News:Vodafone and Telefonica Join Forces in Vantage Joint VentureTelos, ST Engineering Partner to Offer Cybersecurity Solutions in Asia PacificRoku Pops 5% On Quibi Catalog Content Deal",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=8a0615b59d6ff5c555c454ad5c31fbbe15eaceb6ef1078980b83740af9d6d658
