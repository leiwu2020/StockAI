The facility is co-located with a BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE) plant. With the successful operation of the plant, and the easing of restrictions in the region, Corning is commemorating this important step in building its presence in China and strengthening its relationship with an industry leader. This high-volume manufacturing facility allows Corning to deliver Gen 10.5 glass substrates, measuring approximately 3 meters wide by 3 meters high, directly to BOE for its production of large-size display panels. Gen 10.5 glass provides the most economical cuts for 65- and 75-inch TVs, which are expected to drive display-glass market growth over the next several years. The market for large-size TVs, defined as 65-inch and larger, is projected to grow at a double-digit compounded annual growth rate though 2024. “Our decade of experience in G10+ glass manufacturing enabled us to apply the learnings and the technical know-how necessary to ramp this facility rapidly, even during the most challenging of times. Today’s celebration is a testament to our deep commitment to support customer demand while ensuring the safety and health of our employees,” said Chris Hudson, international division vice president and general manager, Corning Display Technologies China. Corning began shipping production samples from the Wuhan plant in January of 2020 and achieved finishing line mass production by mid-2020, despite pandemic-related challenges. The Wuhan manufacturing facility is Corning’s sixth LCD glass plant on the Chinese mainland and its second Gen 10.5 facility along with the company’s Hefei plant in the Anhui Province, which opened in 2018. John Zhang, senior vice president and general manager, Corning Display, said, “Our Wuhan plant is the most recent demonstration of Corning’s commitment to China’s display industry. We appreciate the support we have received from the Dongxihu District, Wuhan municipal, and Hubei provincial governments. With our advanced glass technology and skilled local talent base, we are poised to make even greater contributions to growth in the region.” Caution Concerning Forward-Looking StatementsThe statements contained in this release that are not historical facts or information and contain words such as “will,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “seek,” “see,” “would,” and “target” and similar expressions are forward-looking statements.

The funding will also help accelerate research and development efforts in innovative technologies that support long-lasting product life. Corning is already Apple’s supplier for the precision glass used in iPhones, Apple Watches, and iPads. Over the past four years, the company has received close to $450 million from Apple’s $5 billion Advanced Manufacturing Fund. Apple and Corning boast a long-lasting relationship dating from the first iPhone glass to the Ceramic Shield currently used in iPhone 12. The Ceramic Shield is an extra tough glass-ceramic that the two companies' engineers and experts co-developed. “Ceramic Shield is a prime example of the technologies that are possible when deep innovation meets the power of American manufacturing. We’re so proud to work alongside Corning, whose 170-year-old legacy is a testament to the ingenuity of the US workforce,” said Apple’s Chief Operating Officer (CEO) Jeff Williams. According to Corning CEO Wendell P. Weeks, a long-lasting product development partnership is fueling life-changing innovation while also sustaining the communities where Corning works. Apple supports more than 2.7 million jobs across the US. In the recent past, it has announced plans to add 20,000 new jobs while investing more than $430 billion into the economy over the next five years. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks). Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has reiterated a Buy rating on the stock even as Apple faces off with Epic Games in defense of its App Store ecosystem. The lawsuit was served in the aftermath of Apple's removal of the popular Fortnite game from its platform. The analyst expects the iPhone maker to win the lawsuit. “From an investor perspective, the key services business and its $65 billion+ annual revenue stream for FY21 remain what we estimate is a $1.3 trillion valuation alone for this business and key to future monetization efforts with more bundling efforts on the horizon,” Ives stated. Ives has a $185 price target on Apple, implying 45.84% upside potential to current levels. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 18 Buy, 5 Hold, and 1 Sell ratings. The average analyst price target of $159.96 implies 26.10% upside potential to current levels. AAPL scores an 8 out of 10 in TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, implying it is likely to outperform the overall market.

Corning reported a strong first quarter: GAAP and core sales were $3.3 billion, year-over-year increases of 38% and 29%, respectivelyGAAP EPS was $0.67, reflecting strong performance and a non-cash, mark-to-market gain associated with the company’s currency-hedging contractsCore EPS grew 125% year over year to $0.45All segments grew sales and net income by double-digit percentages year over year Environmental Technologies grew sales 38% and net income 111%Specialty Materials grew sales 28% and net income 78%Optical Communications grew sales 18% and net income 283%Life Sciences grew sales 16% and net income 26%Display Technologies grew sales 15% and net income 40% Free cash flow of $372 million grew $691 million year over year and equates to 39% of 2020 totalProfitability was impacted by approximately $50 million due to elevated freight and logistic costs and global supply chain disruptions Wendell P. Weeks, chairman and chief executive officer, said, “We are off to an outstanding start in 2021. Our success in the first quarter is yet another proof point that we have built a stronger, more resilient company. And we’re confident that we can build on these results to maintain momentum throughout the year.” Weeks continued, “Corning is uniquely qualified to address some of the world’s toughest challenges. Our innovative capabilities put us at the heart of multiple trends that are reshaping the world. This provides a powerful source of long-term growth as we drive more Corning content into the industries we serve.” Weeks concluded, “We remain steadfast in our commitment to support our people, customers, and communities by applying the strength of our products and resources.” Market-Access Platform Highlights Corning continues to advance important growth initiatives across its Market-Access Platforms. Highlights include: Automotive – Environmental Technologies furthered the adoption of its gasoline particulate filter (GPF) innovations, highlighted by its launch of a new generation of GPFs that help vehicles, including hybrids, achieve even lower levels of fine-particulate tailpipe emissions as regulatory limits tighten. Automotive Glass Solutions is meeting growing demand through its large-scale facility in Hefei, China, while collaborating with leading OEMs. Corning is addressing a combined $100-per-car content opportunity across emissions, technical glass products, and auto-glass solutions, including patented 3D Corning® ColdForm™ Technology. The world premiere event for the new all-electric EQS from Mercedes-EQ highlighted its MBUX Hyperscreen – featuring an almost 5-foot-wide Corning Gorilla Glass for Automotive Interiors cover.Mobile Consumer Electronics – Fast Company named Corning the most innovative company in the consumer electronics category for 2021, touting Ceramic Shield as “virtually indestructible” and recognizing Corning® Gorilla® Glass Victus™, the most durable Gorilla Glass to date. Demand for these innovations is strong. During Q1, more than 25 smartphones and 12 laptops launched featuring Gorilla Glasses. Additionally, Advanced Optics is capturing strong demand for its industry-leading extreme ultraviolet (EUV) products as semiconductor manufacturing rapidly adopts EUV technology. In 2020, EUV systems accounted for more than 30% of all semiconductor lithography equipment expenditures. EUV systems are expected to grow significantly over the next five years in both absolute dollars and as a share of equipment expenditures.Optical Communications – Verizon and AT&T – winners in the recent $81 billion 5G spectrum auction that demonstrated the value of using spectrum efficiently – are collaborating with Corning and investing in their fiber networks to meet growing customer demand. Corning is continuing to innovate to reduce the cost and speed the deployment of 5G, hyperscale data centers, and fiber-to-the-home. Verizon recently named Corning a leading network partner for 5G radio nodes in retail and other venue deployments of millimeter-wavelength systems. And Corning’s fiber optic cable manufacturing facility in Hickory, North Carolina, is leveraging Verizon 5G Edge with Amazon Web Services to explore how 5G can reshape manufacturing.Life Sciences – New long-term supply agreements executed in the first quarter support increased production to meet growing demand in diagnostics, bioproduction, and lab research. In addition, Corning doubled its vial production in the first quarter over fourth quarter 2020. Through March 31, the company has shipped enough Corning Valor® Glass vials for hundreds of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses. Corning expanded its contract with the U.S. government to $261 million, a $57 million increase from the $204 million awarded to Corning in June 2020. The funding is enabling Corning to substantially expand domestic manufacturing capacity and help accelerate delivery of COVID-19 vaccines. Display – Corning experienced the most favorable first-quarter pricing environment in more than a decade and announced a moderate increase to its display glass substrate prices for the second quarter. Demand for IT products is expected to grow meaningfully for the second consecutive year, and overall retail demand for TVs remains high. Demand for large-size TVs continues to grow – 75-inch sets were up more than 60% in 2020. These TVs are most efficiently made on the largest fabs, and Corning is well positioned to drive more content into the market in 2021 with the company’s three Gen 10.5 plants. Financial Outlook Tony Tripeny, executive vice president and chief financial officer, said, “Corning had an excellent quarter. We delivered sales, EPS, and cash flow above our expectations. We are off to a great start, and we expect this momentum to continue throughout the year.” Tripeny added, “Multiple events disrupted global supply chains in the first quarter, and we experienced elevated freight and logistic costs that impacted profitability. We expect that these costs will normalize longer term and will begin to decline in the second quarter as we take mitigating actions. We will continue to do what it takes to deliver for our customers.” The company reiterated its commitment to financial stewardship and prudent capital allocation. Corning’s priorities are to generate strong cash flow and use cash to grow, extend market leadership, and reward shareholders. In February, Corning announced a quarterly dividend increase of 9% to $0.24 per share. In April, Corning resumed share repurchases, buying back 4% of its outstanding shares from Samsung Display Co., Ltd. For the second quarter, the company expects core sales to be in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion and core EPS in the range of $0.49 to $0.53. Corning anticipates strong demand and positive momentum across its businesses to continue throughout 2021.

Samsung Display has been an investor in Corning since 2014, when it received preferred shares – convertible after seven years and equivalent to an approximately 7.5% ownership stake – as part of a series of strategic and financial agreements that resulted in Corning acquiring full ownership of Samsung Corning Precision Materials, Co., Ltd. The agreements benefitted both companies’ shareholders. Financial and strategic benefits to Corning included full control of its global fusion-glass manufacturing platform, greater flexibility in asset use, greater operational efficiencies, and increased options to pursue precision-glass opportunities. Following the seven-year anniversary of the agreements, and with the Corning common dividend exceeding the preferred dividend, Samsung Display will convert all of its preferred shares to common, which represents approximately 13% of Corning’s common shares on an as-converted basis. “Corning is a great partner and we are pleased to have an opportunity to strengthen and extend our nearly 50-year relationship,” Joo-Sun Choi, president and chief executive officer of Samsung Display, said. “Our latest seven-year commitment reaffirms Samsung’s confidence in the value of Corning’s capabilities, our ongoing technology collaborations, and our combined innovation leadership.” Based on Samsung Display’s continued confidence in Corning, and the strong performance of its original investment, the two companies will enter into a new agreement for another seven years. Samsung Display will convert all of its preferred shares to 115 million common shares.Corning will repurchase 35 million of those common shares, resulting in Samsung Display having an ownership stake of approximately 9%.The initial repurchase of common shares is expected to close in April 2021 and will immediately reduce Corning’s fully diluted share count by 35 million shares, or about 4%.Samsung Display will maintain its ownership stake in Corning until at least 2028. “From the early days of CRT, to LCD, to more recent collaborations on OLED, QD Display, and flexible displays, we’re proud to be the key material innovation partner to Samsung,” said Wendell P. Weeks, Corning’s chairman and CEO. “We are honored by Samsung Display’s vote of confidence to remain a significant shareholder for another seven years.” Corning Resumes Share Repurchases Corning has consistently demonstrated its long-term commitment to rewarding shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Since the original transactions in 2014 with Samsung Display, Corning has reduced diluted shares by more than 40%, and its Board of Directors has increased the quarterly dividend per share by 140%. This transaction marks the resumption of share repurchases by the company. Tony Tripeny, Corning’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, said, “Outstanding execution and the effectiveness of our ‘more Corning’ strategy put us in a strong position. We’re confident in our future performance and cash generation potential and pleased to resume share buy backs. Repurchasing 4% of our shares through this transaction is a great start. Additionally, the agreement allows payment for the repurchase over two years, providing us with flexibility. “The transaction eliminates the entire class of preferred shares, improves our capital structure, is accretive to EPS, and reduces our aggregate dividend commitment. We’ve seized a great opportunity for the company and for our shareholders,” Tripeny continued.

Under the agreement, Corning will further increase domestic manufacturing capacity of pharmaceutical glass tubing and vials to support the accelerated mass vaccination effort critical to ending the pandemic. Corning has accelerated its advanced glass vial production capacity to support pharmaceutical manufacturers that are delivering hundreds of millions of doses of potentially life-saving vaccines to Americans. This expansion effort, to support President Joe Biden’s goal of vaccinating the majority of Americans against COVID-19 in the next few months, will increase production of Corning’s pharmaceutical glass tubing and vials, including Corning Valor® Glass vials. Ron Verkleeren, Corning’s senior vice president and general manager, Life Sciences, said, “We’re at an inflection point in the COVID-19 response. At this critical moment, every vaccination counts, which means every vial we deliver counts. We’re proud to do our part working with the U.S. government to help ensure that enough glass is available in the supply chain. With this additional infusion of resources, we can significantly scale our tubing and vial capacity to help meet rapidly expanding demand.” This award is in addition to the $204 million contract announced in June 2020, for a total of $261 million invested in Corning’s pharmaceutical vial and tubing manufacturing capacity. Corning has met every milestone to date under the original contract. Corning’s innovative vials continue to set a new standard for glass quality and performance in the pharmaceutical industry. The company is committed to helping protect patients by improving pharmaceutical quality as well as helping accelerate manufacturing through advantages specific to Corning’s coated vial technology.
