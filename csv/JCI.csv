The contract won by Johnson Controls (JCI) will result in improving facilities at landmark buildings including the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center (RRBITC), the New Executive Office Building (NEOB), the Eisenhower Executive Office Building (EEOB), Jackson Place, the Winder Building and the Civil Service Building. Johnson Controls’ chairman and CEO, George Oliver said, “Sustainability, energy efficiency and working toward the goal of net zero are top of mind for government leaders across the United States. This is reflected in the Biden-Harris Administration’s recent infrastructure bill as well as our nation’s re-joining of the Paris Agreement.” “Partnering with the GSA to make these historic buildings more environmentally friendly and energy efficient is an honor, and we look forward to upgrading more buildings around the U.S. in the coming years to create healthier places and do our part to support a healthier planet,” Oliver added. The improvement in facilities will result in reduction of 20,000 tons of greenhouse gases per year and energy savings. As per the contract, JCI will upgrade water conservation, energy management systems, lighting and heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems (HVAC) at these landmark buildings and will use the company’s OpenBlue approach of using digital tools, services and connected solutions. On April 13, Deutsche Bank analyst Nicole DeBlase raised the price target on JCI from $54 to $62 and reiterated a Hold rating on the stock. DeBlase said that while she expects JCI earnings to beat estimates this quarter, the beat could “look less extreme”. Deblase also opined that the company could leave its guidance unchanged for the rest of the year due to the possibility of supply-chain constraints and “price/cost margin pinch as the recovery marches on.” The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic on the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 5 analysts suggesting a Buy and 4 analysts recommending a Hold. The average analyst price target of $63.33 implies around 2.1% upside potential to current levels. According to the TipRanks Smart Score system, JCI scores a 7 out of 10 indicating that the stock is likely to perform in line with market averages.

This includes an upfront payment of $630 million and additional payments subject to achievement of certain milestones post the closing of the acquisition. Johnson Controls (JCI) expects to close the acquisition in the fiscal third quarter of this year and expects the acquisition to be immediately accretive by increasing the company’s adjusted EPS from continuing operations in FY22 in the range of $0.07 to $0.09. Johnson Controls chairman and CEO, George Oliver said, “With Silent-Aire, Johnson Controls has a significant opportunity to increase our focus on the data center vertical and accelerate growth in this attractive end market by combining the strengths of our global scale in manufacturing and service, with leading-edge innovation and a broad portfolio of technologies dedicated to serving hyperscale providers. This acquisition perfectly aligns with several of our key strategic growth initiatives and underscores our focus on creating shareholder value.” JCI said that the migration of applications to the cloud had resulted in expansion of data center infrastructure that has resulted in “the development of hyperscale cloud and colocation facilities” and this is where Silent Aire could effectively provide an array of products. (See Johnson Controls stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the acquisition announcement, Oppenheimer analyst Noah Kaye reiterated a Buy and a price target of $60 on the stock. Kaye said in a note to investors, “The acquisition, JCI’s largest to date since the Tyco merger, would position JCI for leadership in a high-growth vertical, with mix geared toward hyperscale and colocation data centers that are outgrowing the on-premise market with the COVID-19 pandemic accelerating the shift to cloud-native technology adoption.” “We note Silent-Aire brings a portfolio of applied technology solutions such as direct evaporative cooling units (DECs) that are key enablers of data center sustainability/energy efficiency, which we view as increasingly critical for Fortune 100 technology companies leading the hyperscale data center buildout and could help position JCI closer to this vertical,” Kaye added. Overall, the rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic on the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 5 Buys and 5 Holds. The average analyst price target of $60.40 implies that JCI shares are fully priced at current levels.

The Johnson Controls Analyst: Joshua Pokrzywinski upgraded the rating for Johnson Controls from Equal Weight to Overweight, while raising the price target from $52 to $73. The Johnson Controls Thesis: While the company has invested in building modernization and energy efficiency offerings, its fundamentals, like order momentum, operating leverage and free cash flow conversion are improving, Pokrzywinski said in the upgrade note. “We believe the limited earnings growth and share price appreciation over the past several years represent a focus on being in the right markets (i.e., selling auto exposure and adding buildings) rather than focusing within those markets. We believe the past 12-18 months of fundamental performance demonstrate that JCI is starting to catch up,” he added. “We see upgrade supercycle for commercial buildings to improve energy efficiency driven by short paybacks, sustainability efforts, and legislation. We believe the market is underestimating how much retrofits can accelerate growth for the foreseeable future,” the analyst wrote.
