This was followed by a series of upgrades from several analysts of renowned research houses. Shares closed at $407.06 on July 13.



Costco shares hit a 52-week high of $414.35 on July 12 and have gained 24.1% over the past year. (See Costco stock charts on TipRanks)



On July 8, the company released sales figures for the five weeks ending July 4. Costco reported sales of $18.92 billion, up 16.9% year over year, while comparable sales grew 14.1% for the same period.



For the forty-four weeks ending July 4, sales grew 18.1% to $161.09 billion year-over-year, and comparable sales grew 16.4%.



Additionally, yesterday Costco announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.79 per share payable on August 13 to shareholders of record on July 30.



Analysts Weigh In



Following the June sales results, Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh assigned a Buy rating to the stock and lifted the price target to $450 (10.6% upside potential) from $425.



Parikh has a positive long-term outlook for the company. Some of the catalysts that spur his sentiment include a unique and improving consumer value proposition, leading competitive position, consistent track record of shareholder returns, strong management team, and potential for sustainable top-and bottom-line delivery despite a more competitive retail backdrop.



Parikh believes all of the above catalysts will boost Costco’s share price and performance going forward, however, he says, “Given still difficult upcoming compares, cost pressures, and positive stimulus spending, the setup has gotten even trickier.” 



The Wall Street community is bullish on the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 18 Buys and 6 Holds. The average Costco price target of $420.10 implies 3.2% upside potential to current levels.

The retailer has entered into an arrangement with Dogness (DOGZ) to feature its smart pet products in the new stores. Dogness stock jumped 16.37% on Thursday following the announcement. (See Dogness stock analysis on TipRanks)



Founded in 2003 and boasting more than 200 patents and pending patents, Dogness makes and sells pet products, including hygiene items. In the new stores, Costco will feature products such as Dogness Smart Treat Dispenser, Dogness Smart Fountain Plus, and Smart Cam iPet Robot. 



Featuring Dogness in the new stores is just the start. The partners plan a broader rollout to other Costco locations in October in preparation for the 2021 holiday season. (See Costco stock analysis on TipRanks)



Dogness CEO Silong Chen commented, ""We are excited to be further expanding our relationship with Costco, a valued partner. Costco will prominently feature several of our best-selling smart pet products, which will help further raise awareness and drive sales…This is an ideal partnership with extensive additional upside as we continue to outperform, expand to a larger scale and into more stores.""



Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink recently reiterated a Buy rating on Costco stock and raised the price target to $445 from $410. The analyst’s new price target implies 16.18% upside potential.



""Survey results are consistent with COST monthly results as members report high levels of engagement, cross category shopping, and renewals. COST members are increasingly digitally engaged and more interested in grocery pickup vs. fall survey,” observed Wissink.



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 19 Buys and 4 Holds. The Costco average analyst price target of $416.76 implies 8.81% upside potential to current levels.



Costco scores a “Perfect 10” on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

Earnings for the quarter stood at $2.75 per share, an increase of 45.5% year-over-year, and surpassed the Street’s estimates of $2.34 per share.



Total revenue came in at $45.28 billion, up 21.4% from the prior-year quarter, and outpaced the Street’s estimates of $43.64 billion. Net sales increased 21.7% to $44.38 billion and membership fees grew 10.6% to $901 million.



Comparable sales (excluding impacts of gasoline prices and foreign exchange fluctuations) increased 15.1%, including an E-commerce comp sales rise of 63.6%.(See Costco stock analysis on TipRanks)



Following the third-quarter results, Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $425, which implies 9.7% upside potential to current levels.



Parikh said, “We look very favorably upon COST's long-term prospects. A few key factors underpin our views: 1) unique and improving consumer value proposition; 2) open-ended worldwide growth prospects; 3) leading competitive position poised to continue to drive share gains... However, given still difficult upcoming compares, cost pressures, and positive stimulus spending, the setup has gotten even more trickier. As a result, we view COST shares as appropriate for longer-term players.”



The Wall Street community has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Costco’s stock. That’s based on 18 Buys and 5 Holds. The average analyst price target of $408.38 implies 5.4% upside potential to current levels. Shares have gained 1.9% year-to-date.



Costco scores a “Perfect 10” from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.
