Dow futures were trading flat, S&P futures were 0.3% higher and NASDAQ futures were leading the way, up around 0.93% at the time of writing. Investors are waiting for earnings results from Constellation Brands (STZ), ConAgra Foods (CAG) and Apogee (APOG) before the bell, while WD-40 (WDFC), PriceSmart (PSMT) and Kush Bottles (KSHB) are expected to report after the market closes. Castor Maritime (CTRM) was the most actively traded stock in the pre-market with over three million shares having already changed hands. The stock looked set to open around 4% lower at the time of writing. Vericity (VERY) was the strongest stock before the bell climbing over 100% at one point. There is no fundamental news to support the price move but discussions involving the stock have been circulating on social media and trading platforms since yesterday. Meanwhile, Kentucky First Federal Bancorp (KFFB) was the weakest stock before the open falling 36%. The companyâs board of directors declared a $0.10 cash dividend payable on May 17 to shareholders of record on April 30. In corporate earnings news, Paychex (PAYX) reported a 3% year-over-year decline in revenue to $1.1 billion while operating income came in flat at $468.6 million. According to CEO Martin Mucci, âClient retention remains strong and at record levels, and our results for the third quarter show that our resilient business model has helped us navigate the uncertainties created by COVID-19.â Simply Good Foods (SMPL) reported better-than-expected Q2 results and provided full year fiscal 2021 guidance that topped analystsâ estimates. Adjusted earnings in the second quarter rose 8.7% year-over-year to $0.25 per share, beating consensus estimates of $0.22. Net sales inched up 1.5% to $230.6 million and surpassed analystsâ expectations of $230.1 million.

Meanwhile, revenues outpaced analystsâ expectations. Lamb Westonâs (LW) 3Q net sales declined 4% on a year-over-year basis to $896 million but topped analystsâ expectations of $816.45 million. Adjusted earnings decreased 41% to $0.45 per share and missed the Street estimates of $0.51 per share. The companyâs SG&A expenses grew 9.3% in the quarter, while interest expenses surged 16.3%. Sales volume dropped 6% as pandemic-driven restrictions resulted in lower demand. Notably, lower volume in global and foodservice segments was partially offset by higher volume in the retail segment. Lamb Weston CEO Tom Werner said, âIn the coming months, we believe the gradual improvement in frozen potato demand will continue to the extent governments further lift social restrictions, and as warmer weather provides more outside dining opportunities. The ongoing disruptive effects of COVID-19 on our supply chain will continue to pressure near-term costs, but should also lessen after vaccines become more widely available for our manufacturing teams and our supply chain partners.â (See Lamb Weston stock analysis on TipRanks) âIn addition, we remain optimistic that overall demand in the U.S. will steadily return to pre-pandemic levels around the end of calendar 2021, and that global category growth will resume at historical rates soon thereafter,â Werner added. Following the 3Q results, Jefferies analyst Robert Dickerson increased the stockâs price target to $84 (7.7% upside potential) from $80 and reiterated a Hold rating. âWhile the risk/reward seems tilted to the upside if margins (and EBITDA) can inflect quickly throughout FYâ22,â Dickerson is âsitting this one out for now given near-term cost headwinds and valuation,â which he sees as âfairâ based on the companyâs history. The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 1 Buy and 1 Hold. The average analyst price target of $92 implies 18% upside potential to current levels. Shares have jumped 35% over the past year.

Commenting after the companyâs 2Q release, Dickerson said, âWhile lambâs 2Q results were generally in-line with expectations, managementâs near-term outlook pointed to more pressured volumes y/y sequentially in 3Q, driven by heightened government imposed social restrictions combined with the reduced cold winter restaurant demand.â Dickerson added, âGiven a pressured 3Q should have been somewhat known, 4Q should be the return to growthâ¦the momentum in Lambâs stock could easily continue, as long as the pricing and competitive backdrop remains stable.â The other analyst covering the stock, Barclaysâ Andrew Lazar has a Buy rating on the stock with an $84 price target. The two ratings add up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating with an average analyst price target of $82, which implies upside potential of around 3% from current levels.
