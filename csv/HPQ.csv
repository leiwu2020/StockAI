Following the aforementioned closure news, the share price of the technology company rose 2.2% to close at $29.86 on Tuesday.



The cash deal, which was announced in February this year, was valued at approximately $425 million.



The acquisition is expected to boost HP’s growth in peripherals and expand its gaming network. Furthermore, the deal is likely to be accretive to HP’s adjusted earnings within in the first year.



HP’s Personal Systems President Alex Cho said, ""We are delighted to officially welcome the incredible people of HyperX to HP. HyperX has built a loyal following among gamers and we look forward to further strengthening the HyperX brand.”



Cho further added, “This acquisition further advances our ability to create the compute experiences of the future, expand into valuable adjacencies, and unlock new sources of growth.”​ (See HP stock analysis on TipRanks)



On May 28, Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated the stock’s price target of $38 (27.3% upside potential) and a Buy rating as he thinks ""the steady state EPS will be much higher for HP going forward versus what investors are apprehensive about, due to buybacks and better profitability on print.”



Daryanani said, “While clearly some of the benefits here are cyclical in nature, we think there is a fair amount of secular change that should make the current margin structure in print more sustainable and FCF should provide a sustained lever for upside.”



The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 3 Buys versus 2 Holds. The average analyst price target of $35.40 implies 18.6% upside potential to current levels. Shares have increased 30.9% over the past six months.

Fall on Concerns Strong PC Sales Have Peaked",68062285,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jJJCScsbT0oWJ9L94sJvXA--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/d7b45aff369519450d05185d8fb51c36,HPQ,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Dell Technologies Inc. and HP Inc. reported revenue and earnings that showed consumers and companies continue to buy personal computers even as pandemic lockdowns ease in some parts of the world. The strong results didn’t help the stocks, which declined.Round Rock, Texas-based Dell said fiscal first-quarter sales rose 12% to $24.5 billion, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $23.3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. HP reported revenue in its fiscal second quarter jumped 27% to $15.9 billion, also topping estimates by $1 billion. HP also raised its annual profit target.Despite the positive numbers, some investors are betting that PC growth is peaking and won’t accelerate further, said Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross. Dell shares fell about 3.6% and HP dropped 8.5% at 10:07 a.m. in New York. HP has experienced a surge in demand for laptops needed by people working and going to school remotely during the Covid-19 pandemic, and those sales are persisting, Chief Executive Officer Enrique Lores said. The drag on the company’s performance is a continuing shortage of computer chips, which means HP can’t match supply to the demand for its products, Lores said. That situation will persist until the end of 2021.Dell executives echoed the concern about chips, predicting component supply constraints will continue into next year. The company will price into its products the higher costs of memory chips and displays while watching the impact that may have on demand for computers, Chief Financial Officer Tom Sweet said.“These are things we’re going to have to navigate through and they’ll be with us for a while,” he said in an interview. “In the long term we’re very optimistic about this space. If the pandemic did anything it accelerated customers thinking that they need to invest in technology.”Revenue in the second quarter typically increases about 6% sequentially, but will likely fall short of that this year, Sweet predicted.HP’s PC-related sales rose 27% in the three-month period, which ended April 30. Dell reported a 20% revenue increase at its laptop and desktop unit. Palo Alto, California-based HP said notebook sales surged 47% from the same period a year earlier.HP’s printer business had suffered from weak demand in the lockdown as companies held off on purchases of gear not needed in empty offices. But printing and supplies revenue rebounded strongly in the quarter, helped by more companies reopening their offices and stocking up again. Margins were hurt by increasing costs, Chief Financial Officer Marie Myers said.“We do expect revenue to be driven by available supply rather than demand,” Myers said. “Components and logistics costs are headwinds.”While Dell Chief Executive Officer Michael Dell is trying to reduce the reliance of his company on one-time hardware sales in favor of subscription-based computer services, PC purchases still generate about half of revenue.Sales from consumer PCs rose 42% to $3.5 billion in the quarter, the company said. That compares with a 19% expansion in the prior period. PC sales to business and government agencies were up 14% to $9.8 billion.Server and networking sales rose 9% to $4.1 billion from a year earlier. Storage hardware revenue was $3.8 billion. Services revenue rose 10% in the quarter to $6.45 billion.Sales from VMware Inc., which is majority-owned by Dell, were $3 billion, up 9%. In April Dell said it will spin off its stake in VMware, creating two publicly traded companies and raising cash to pay down debt.(Updates with shares in third paragraph.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=80f2c529f18779fc6553cde8738f22b581da8de1eda22bc5f25d2860afd9b3e0

PALO ALTO, Calif., May 12, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ) today introduced HP Wolf Security, a newly integrated portfolio of secure by design PCs and printers, hardware-enforced endpoint security software, and endpoint security services to protect customers from growing cyber threats.3 HP Wolf Security’s Blurred Lines & Blindspots report, also released today, highlights that the global volume of cyberattacks has increased 238% during Covid, with hackers particularly focused on targeting remote workers. The company’s new HP Wolf Security platform builds on over 20 years of security research and innovation to offer a unified portfolio for customers focused on delivering comprehensive endpoint protection and cyber-resiliency. “The future of work will be more distributed than ever before, with a growing number of people working from multiple locations outside the office. This will unlock exciting new opportunities for greater mobility, but it also creates new vulnerabilities,” said Joanna Burkey, Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), HP Inc.HP Wolf Security’s Blurred Lines & Blindspots report reveals that endpoints connected to the internet were experiencing 1.5 attacks per minute globally in 2020. As a result, 91% of IT decision makers surveyed said they spend more time on endpoint security now than two years ago, with a further 91% reporting that endpoint security has become just as important as network security.HP has long been a leader in PC and printer security. By uniting the company’s security offerings into a single platform for customers, HP is addressing a growing customer need for comprehensive and resilient endpoint infrastructure and cyber defense. “As the importance of endpoint security continues to grow, we saw an opportunity to create a more integrated offering for customers to simplify security and stay ahead of future threats,” said Ian Pratt, Global Head of Security, Personal Systems, HP Inc. “The leading technology of the future will be secure by design and intelligent enough to not simply detect threats, but to contain and mitigate their impact, and to recover quickly in the event of a breach, which could happen at any time, to any one of us. HP Wolf Security is a new breed of endpoint security tailored for the future of work.”Rooted in Zero Trust principles, HP Wolf Security harnesses state-of-the-art technologies to reduce pressure on IT. From self-healing firmware, in-memory breach detection and threat containment via virtualization, to cloud-based intelligence, HP Wolf Security delivers comprehensive protection by: shrinking the addressable attack surface; enabling remote recovery from firmware attacks; enhancing threat data collection; and delivering high fidelity alerts. The newly integrated HP Wolf Security portfolio is categorized by: HP Wolf Security for Home4 includes a set of built-in security features for select consumer PCs as well as HP Wolf Essential Security software and services.

HP Sure Access creates hardware-enforced micro-virtual machines (VM) that can protect key applications – forming a virtual air gap between the application and the host PC. The application and data is securely isolated from the host OS, and any malicious actors that may have breached it. This unique, hardware-enforced approach helps by: Securing key tasks such as remote sysadmin activity of mission-critical systems.Allowing users to work securely on multiple virtual Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs) on a single device.Securing browser-based access of critical applications. HP introduces HP Wolf Pro Security Edition9 platform for small and mid-sized businesses HP redefines PC security for small and mid-sized customers with the announcement of HP Wolf Pro Security. HP Wolf Pro Security integrates Threat Containment based on micro-virtualization, Malware Prevention based on Next-Gen Anti-Virus, and Identity Protection – all integrated with HP’s hardware security capabilities to deliver superior protection that is simple for IT to acquire, deploy and operate. Threat Containment raises the bar in endpoint protection by providing protection that doesn’t rely on detection. Hardware-powered micro-virtualization performs full isolation of threats delivered via all the most common threat vectors, without impacting user experience.Malware Prevention is a complete Next-Gen AV that uses a combination of AI-based techniques, like deep learning, and behavioral analysis to provide advanced malware protection through predictive detection.Identity Protection provides defense against credential phishing attacks for all popular browsers.Integrated with HP’s built-in hardware security capabilities such as Application Persistence, OS Resiliency and Physical Tamper Protection. Today, HP also announced a new Flexworker offering with HP Wolf Security that allows IT departments to boost workforce productivity while helping to protect corporate networks and data. This new extended Managed Print Service (MPS) allows IT departments to arm hybrid workers with secure, company-approved printers that can be monitored and automatically remediated if a device falls out of compliance with corporate policies. In addition, HP Wolf Essential Security is included with HP+ smart printers, with 24-7 built-in Security. HP+ printers with Smart Security help consumers and small businesses stay two steps ahead of hackers, helping to prevent potential malware attacks and stop your information from ending up in the wrong hands. To support the launch of HP Wolf Security, HP has created a series of creative videos, depicting common security scenarios that have come about due to the shift to remote working during the pandemic. These include: a child clicking on a phishing link when using a parent’s laptop, a compromised printer being used to send malicious spam to the rest of the company, and an IT team being blindsided by a cyberattack. These videos, starring Christian Slater as ‘The Wolf’ – who walks the line between good and bad, putting to use his hacker mindset to show how an attacker might operate – help to demonstrate the impact of such events.

News Highlight 3 HP EliteDesk 800 G8 Desktop Mini Business PC is the world’s smallest and most powerful USFF business PC.[14] PALO ALTO, Calif., May 06, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today HP Inc. introduced the EliteOne 800 G8 All-in-One (AiO) for more engaging collaboration and meaningful connections in hybrid work environments. HP also announced new commercial desktop PCs. People want to make personal connections – whether with eye contact, body language, or clear and crisp audio. With 32% of office employees expected to work from home in the foreseeable future and 26% expected to split their time between home and office,1 technology that helps bridge the physical distance between team members and coworkers is critical. “The pandemic has given us a fresh perspective on not only the importance of the PC, but better insight into how we collaborate, stay connected, and elevate the way we work at home and in the office,” said Andy Rhodes, Global Head of Commercial Systems and Display Solutions at HP. “Our premium desktop portfolio enables authentic and meaningful collaboration experiences and optimal productivity in new work environments.” Purpose built for collaborating and connecting with others, the sleek HP EliteOne 800 G8 All-in-One drives productivity and elevates your style of working in your home or at the office. The HP EliteOne 800 G8 All-in-One is a virtual conference powerhouse for the home and the office. Available with a 23.8-inch or 27-inch diagonal display, and an integrated pop-up camera, the PC empowers users to show up in an authentic way and better connect with colleagues when they cannot be there in person. Powered by an 11th Gen Intel® Core™ processor,2 the PC can handle resource-intensive projects and virtual meetings so users can multi-task and co-create quickly and reliably. At the same time, the HP security suite keeps user data safe and secure. Designed for collaboration, the EliteOne 800 AiO allows users to: See clearly and look their best. Making a personal connection in a virtual world starts with eye contact. The optional dual-facing 5MP camera3 ensures users are seen clearly. Intelligent face tracking follows and actively frames user movement so they can break free from their desk, move around, and stretch during virtual calls. Not only does the camera follow the user, but with a wider field of view with the popup webcam, users can look their best with a more flattering angle while giving them more room to roam during their calls. When it comes to lighting, auto scene detection automatically adjusts for optimal video, ensuring users look great any time of day.Hear clearly and sound their best. Minimize potential background sounds with premium audio features. AI-based noise reduction filters not only outbound noise, but inbound noise as well. This is the first HP PC with this enhanced experience and can filter over 350 million types of voices and noises. HP Dynamic Voice Leveling automatically adjusts the volume on voice to maintain consistent volume whether near or far from the microphone. HP Sound Calibration4 tunes audio for an immersive sound experience and HP Dynamic Audio5 uses AI-based technology to tune audio to speech, music, and movies while suppressing background noise.Work and be at their best. Users can optimize how they work in shared spaces. HP Run Quiet Design finely tunes the fans to keep systems running quiet and cool, minimizing distractions for users and those around them. HP Modern Standby delivers a ready-to-work experience by downloading emails, receiving network events, and making other important updates while the PC is asleep and connected to a network. Additionally, HP Presence Aware helps keep data secure by locking the PC when users step away and waking the PC when they return.Feel supported by an empowered IT team. IT teams are enabled with solutions to simplify how they deploy, secure, and manage their PC fleets. HP Manageability Integration Kit helps shorten the amount of time needed to setup PCs and allows IT to better manage the devices once deployed. HP Patch Assistant enables automation of software updates based on a schedule set by IT, with no end user dependency. The HP EliteOne 800 G8 All-in-One is the world’s first commercial AiO with AI-based noise reduction,6 and the world’s first commercial AiO with presence awareness7 which helps keep data secure.

Launched in the fall of 2020 to commercial partners, the powerful new partner program, built on a single, integrated structure provides the insights, capabilities and collaboration tools needed to drive digital transformation and growth as consumer buying behaviors continue to evolve. HP will begin to transition retail partners1 to the HP Amplify program beginning August 2, 2021 and continue through the calendar year. Built on a simplified and easy-to-navigate structure with two distinct retail tracks (Synergy and Power including Power CDR Retail targeted at retail sub-distributors), HP Amplify is designed from the ground up to turn data analytics into insights that spark new strategies, steer innovation and reward partners for performance, collaboration and capabilities while accelerating digital transformation with insights, building a data driven culture and augmenting common knowledge with collaboration tools. “For the IT industry overall, and the retail channel specifically, it is clear that business as usual is no longer an option. HP Amplify not only makes it easier for retail partners to do business with HP, it provides a clear path, built on a proven framework, to transform their business for today while enabling long-term sustained growth in the future,” said Christoph Schell, Chief Commercial Officer, HP Inc. “Together with our partner community we are reinventing how consumers experience our products and services, by investing in our shared capabilities while developing new areas of strength to remain competitive.” Rewriting the Rules of RetailSpurred by rising demand for work, learn and entertain at home products accelerated by the pandemic, the retail industry has experienced an accelerated pace of change. According to Gartner, capitalizing on the momentum of transformational experiences will be critical to building and maintaining the flexibility that is demanded of doing business today. For the foreseeable future, changes in consumer behavior will have a greater impact on value in retail than any other single factor2. While in-store traffic decreased, e-commerce sales grew by more than 27 percent in 20203, and is expected to account for 40 percent of total sales for consumer-packaged goods by 20254. Trends such as hybrid work, the emergence of the prosumer and continued e-commerce growth are making collaborative partnerships in the retail industry more essential than ever. With the introduction of HP Amplify, HP is empowering retailers to capitalize on these shifts, arming partners to deliver superior customer experiences and drive future growth. “Customers are requesting a closer and more personalized relationship with brands,” said Quentin Duminy, Global Buyer at Group Auchan, a leading retailer based in France. “We will increase our common knowledge of the consumption patterns using data analytics in order to redesign the customer journey, improving experiences online and in-store through HP’s Amplify for Retail program.” Performance, Capabilities & Collaboration5 HP Amplify offers a common platform designed to enable progressive go-to-market strategies focused on three core pillars: performance, capabilities, and collaboration. PerformanceBuilding on the success of the HP Amplify framework while addressing unique needs of retailers, the new program rewards partners for a variety of performance indicators tied to portfolio sell through and revenue. A structured compensation framework, sales boosters, and other tools help retail partners to assess performance and actions providing clear indicators of success. CapabilitiesBeyond sales revenue alone, HP Amplify measures rewards based on new capabilities such as driving data insights, service models, consistent online and in-store experiences. Strengthening and developing of new capabilities are supported by online digital assessments and recommendations based on core capabilities, consumer trends, benchmarking, and best practices. HP Amplify rewards partners who invest in the capabilities to compete – and win – in a world dominated by e-commerce and digital-led customer journeys. CollaborationTransformational change requires collaborative partnerships. Companies that regularly collaborate with suppliers can demonstrate higher growth, lower operating costs, and greater profitability than their industry peers6. Partners that report data will be able to anticipate and enable more positive customer outcomes, ultimately driving sales conversions and maximizing average baskets. HP will collaborate closely with partners to optimize sales through store level assortment tools and cross category recommendations to unlock opportunity diversification. For additional details on HP Amplify including the partner FAQ, visit the HP Press Center. A Path to a More Sustainable FutureThe HP Amplify partner program also provides partners with an optional path to a more sustainable future. Launched earlier this year to commercial partners, HP Amplify™ Impact is an industry-first partner assessment, resource and training program aimed at driving meaningful change across HP’s three Sustainable Impact pillars – Planet, with an emphasis on climate action; People, with an emphasis on human rights and social justice; and Community, with an emphasis on digital equity. The HP Amplify Impact program helps to empower partners to set bold, long-term objectives to drive positive impact. Partners that pledge to join the HP Amplify Impact program will work with HP to assess their own practices while tapping into the company’s extensive investments and initiatives. Recognized as one of the world’s most sustainable companies, HP has enrolled more than 1,000 partners worldwide in the HP Amplify Impact program, representing a major step forward in the company’s ambitious goal to become the most sustainable and just technology company by 2030.

The Taiwan-based company is a key supplier to Apple, manufacturing mostly Macbooks. It similarly produces goods for the likes of HP Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.REvil’s public face on the darkweb, a user on the cyber-crime forum XSS who goes by the name ‘Unknown’, announced Sunday that the ransomware group was on the cusp of declaring its “largest attack ever,” in a post reviewed by Bloomberg News. The post was made in Russian on a channel where the REvil group recruits new affiliates, according to a person familiar with Unknown’s history on the XSS forum who sought anonymity for fear of retaliation.By early on April 20, REvil’s ‘Happy Blog’ -- a site where the cartel publicly names and shames victims in hopes of coaxing ransom payment -- declared Quanta its latest victim. In their post, also reviewed by Bloomberg, the hackers claim they’d waited to disclose the Quanta compromise until the date of Apple’s latest big reveal, contending the parts supplier had expressed no interest in paying to recover the stolen data.Quanta acknowledged an attack without explaining if or how much of its data was stolen.“Quanta Computer’s information security team has worked with external IT experts in response to cyber attacks on a small number of Quanta servers,” the company said in a statement. “We’ve reported to and kept seamless communications with the relevant law enforcement and data protection authorities concerning recent abnormal activities observed. There’s no material impact on the company’s business operation.”By the time Apple’s product launch was over, REvil had posted schematics for a new laptop, including 15 images detailing the guts of what appears to be a Macbook designed as recently as March 2021, according to the documents reviewed by Bloomberg.REvil is now attempting to shake-down Apple in its effort to profit off the stolen data. They’ve asked Apple to pay their ransom by May 1, as was first reported by Bleeping Computer. Until then, the hackers will continue to post new files every day, REvil said on its blog.An Apple spokesperson declined to comment on questions about the compromise.Quanta added that its information security defense system was activated immediately, and it has resumed internal services affected by the incident. The company is upgrading its cybersecurity infrastructure to protect its data.Ransomware is a type of malicious code that typically encrypts a victim’s data or network of computers. The hackers then demand a ransom to decrypt the information, or a promise from the hackers not to sell their secret documents. More recently, ransomware gangs have also stolen data and threatened to make it public unless the victim pays a fee. REvil’s the same group that executed a ransomware attack in 2020 against a law firm they claimed once represented some of Donald Trump’s television enterprises. In 2019, the group also attacked a group of Louisiana election clerks a week before Election Day.REvil attempted to engage Quanta in ransom negotiations last week inside a chat-room on the attacker’s darkweb page, according to a transcript that’s been reviewed by Bloomberg News. The REvil operator started the interaction by claiming to have stolen and encrypted “all local network data” while demanding $50 million for the decryption key to unlock their systems.A user responded two days later, stating they were “not the person in-charge of the company“ but wanted clarity on the terms of engagement. The engagement caused confusion, and another two days later, REvil’s operator threatened to publish Apple’s data. It appears the conversation then moved to email.REvil then delivered on its promise to publish data it believes to be Apple’s proprietary blueprints for new devices.

(NYSE: HPQ) announced some of the most aggressive and comprehensive climate goals in the technology industry. The commitments highlight the progress the company is making to drive a net zero carbon, fully regenerative economy, reduce its overall environmental footprint, and strengthen its business for the long term to create the most sustainable portfolio of products and solutions in the industry. The measures HP is driving, that build on the strength of its complete list of 2025 goals, are among the most comprehensive climate actions in the technology sector and align with relevant U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. “Climate change is a defining challenge of our generation that demands immediate action and investment,” said Enrique Lores, HP Inc. President and CEO. “Now is a time for bold moves and ambitious goals that will protect our planet and create new sources of innovation and growth across the global economy. By driving toward net-zero carbon emissions across our entire value chain by 2040, product circularity and a forest positive framework, we will accelerate our progress and advance HP’s aspiration to become the world’s most sustainable and just technology company.” A video accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/51f46d17-28b9-4298-a5fb-63a01b840704 The Case for Business TransformationTo achieve its goals, HP is focused on accelerating five strategic drivers intended to decouple growth from carbon emissions and resource consumption, drive innovation, and transform design and business models: Print and Compute-as-a-Service: Print supplies renewal, hardware-as-a-service, certified pre-owned, hardwareSustainable materials: Increase use of renewable and recycled materialsSupply chain decarbonization: Drive and support supplier carbon reduction, use of renewable electricity, and adoption of surface transportation and alternative fuels and electric vehicles for product shipmentsEnergy efficiency: Design in existing and new energy-efficient product technologiesForest investments: Address the fiber used in printing and packaging by investing in forest restoration and protection, and continue to source certified or recycled materials Carbon Emissions and CircularityTo achieve these targets, HP will be carbon neutral in its operations by 2025 and reduce Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% on an absolute basis by 2030, compared to 2019.6 Additionally, 75% HP’s total annual product and packaging content, by weight, will come from recycled, renewable and/or reused materials, products and parts by 2030.HP commits to 75% of its total annual product and packaging content (by weight) to come from recycled and renewable materials and reused products and parts by 2030. These actions will help to position HP to reach net zero emissions across its value chain by 2040. In line with HP’s circularity ambitions, HP Operations will be zero waste in its managed facilities by 2025.7 HP's Customer Support organization will also be carbon neutral across both HP and partner-run operations by 2030.HP will pursue and accelerate a range of steps, including enabling a circular economy by using more sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics and metals, and investing in forest restoration and protection.8 Since 1991, HP has kept more than 875 million HP cartridges, 114 million apparel hangers, and 4.69 billion postconsumer plastic bottles out of landfills—instead, upcycling them to make new HP products. After introducing the world’s most sustainable PC portfolio, HP continues to innovate throughout its product portfolio and work with key partners to achieve circularity. HP is a member of NextWave Plastics, collaborating across industries to create the first global network of ocean-bound plastic supply chains. HP is also a member of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Network and the Circulytics measurement tool.HP was the first global IT company to publish its full carbon footprint and set carbon emissions reduction goals for its operations, supply chain, products and solutions. HP was among the first 10% of companies with GHG emissions reduction goals approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, including a 1.5°C aligned goal to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 emissions 60% by 2025 compared to 2015. For two consecutive years, HP is the only technology company to have been named to CDP’s A lists for climate, forests, and water, as well as CDP’s supplier engagement leaderboard. HP has been a member of RE 100 since 2016 and EV 100 since 2017.Reducing Carbon in HP Supplies HP will transform its print business from a transactional model to a services model, while actively reducing the carbon footprint of its company and its products. To accelerate a transition to a net zero value chain, HP commits to carbon neutrality for its supplies business by 2030. HP will start transitioning supplies to be carbon neutral by launching the HP Instant Ink with Planet Partners pilot, leveraging recycling and new renewal capabilities to extend the life of Original HP Supplies. This pilot will help customers decrease virgin plastic used, and diminish waste, including ocean-bound plastics, on the pathway to circularity. Launching in Germany in May 2021, HP Instant Ink with Planet Partners will allow HP Instant Ink subscribers to opt-in to receive renewed cartridges. The end-to-end use of HP technology and engineering is what makes this pilot unique. The consistent reliability and outstanding print quality of Original HP Supplies mean fewer reprints and less waste. Forest Protection and Restoration HP is also focused on nature-based solutions with global partners including World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Arbor Day Foundation and through its own Sustainable Forests Collaborative. HP is one of the few companies in the world to achieve a zero deforestation goal for the sourcing of its paper and packaging. In 2020, HP has achieved zero deforestation for 99% of HP brand paper and paper-based product packaging with the remaining 1% assessed to ensure reported fiber usage meets HP’s Sustainable Paper and Wood Policy9. HP brand paper has been deforestation-free since 2016. For paper-based product packaging, this represents the culmination of five years of work to enhance HP’s procurement processes and collaborate with more than 100 suppliers to drive progress. HP has implemented a conformance assurance program to manage any corrective actions and maintain this performance in the future. Now going beyond the company’s own responsible sourcing of HP brand papers, by 2030 HP will scale up investment in forest restoration, protection and other initiatives to counteract deforestation for non-HP paper used in HP products and print services. HP is the only technology company to set a goal to address deforestation that goes beyond its own fiber sourcing to include the use of its products and services.10 To ensure the vision to make every page printed with HP is sourced responsibly and contributes to restoration and protection of forests, HP created the Forest Positive Framework11 which includes partnering with leading NGOs and organizations to take action beyond restoration and protection to include developing science-based targets for forests, collaborating with the industry, and innovating more efficient print technologies. A Continued Commitment to Sustainable Impact and Climate Collaboration Efforts to make a sustainable impact on people, the planet and communities are integrated into HP’s business strategy and operations, and have become an increasingly important driver of customer purchasing decisions. HP’s Sustainable Impact efforts helped drive more than US$1 billion in sales wins in 2020 for the second year in a row.To further its commitment to the restoration and protection of the world’s oceans and forests, HP also announces a series of updates to its NGO partnerships. The company has joined the Ocean Conservancy’s Trash Free Seas Alliance as a member of the Steering Committee for its newest Signature Initiative: ASPPIRe (Advancing Solutions to Plastic Pollution through Inclusive Recycling). ASPPIRe aims to reduce plastic pollution in the world’s oceans, create a stable market for low-value plastics in selected geographies and increase the availability of recycled content. HP is the only technology company on the committee and is working alongside some of the world’s largest brands including PepsiCo, Starbucks Coffee Company, Dow, and Kimberly-Clark. HP also announces new partners joining HP’s Sustainable Forests Collaborative, including Andhra Paper Limited, Crown Van Gelder, Felix Schoeller Group, International Paper Company, Lenzing Papier, and Mondi Uncoated Fine Paper. Additionally, as the largest open-membership non-profit organization for forests big and small, Arbor Day Foundation is joining as an advisor to the Collaborative. Arbor Day’s mission is to inspire people to plant, nurture, and celebrate trees. The cross-industry collaboration will demonstrate scientific and viable approaches to keeping forest ecosystems healthy. Together, HP and its industry partners seek others to join the movement of protecting and restoring forests for future generations.In addition, HP announces it is the founding sponsor of the Forest Stewardship Council’s (FSC) “One Simple Action” digital marketplace (https://onesimpleaction.org/), that helps consumers understand why FSC matters, and products they can buy if they want to be part of the solution for forests. FSC certification is the most rigorous standard available in the marketplace, ensuring that critical forest ecosystems—and the wildlife and workers that depend upon them—are protected. These new partnerships build on HP’s existing portfolio of NGO collaborations committed to protecting natural resources, preventing biodiversity loss, and combating climate change. HP has garnered recognition with seven Good Green Design Awards for responsible design and manufacturing through the use of sustainable materials and finishes, including ocean-bound plastics and water-borne finishes.

News highlights: Innofibre, the industry’s leading independent research institute in Quebec, Canada, validates significant advantages of new HP Molded Fiber Advanced Tooling SolutionPartners and customers Eco Pulp, PMD, Polyco Healthline Group, Veritiv, Vernacare and others exploring opportunities for entirely new packaging designsNew technology advancements provide increased productivity and digital production of higher quality, more customized molded fiber tools PALO ALTO, Calif., April 13, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today at the International Molded Fiber Association (IMFA) annual conference, the leading event for the molded fiber industry, HP showcased independently verified performance leadership, partners and customers driving entirely new packaging designs, and significant technology advancements for its recently introduced HP Advanced Molded Fiber Tooling Solution. The HP Molded Fiber Advanced Tooling Solution is an innovative and environmentally-friendly solution for molded fiber manufacturers. Today, Innofibre, the industry’s leading expert on cellulosic product innovation, released new research data validating HP’s solution as a more productive, efficient option for molded fiber tooling compared with traditional woven wire tooling. “Based on our testing, HP’s Molded Fiber Advanced Tooling Solution can offer greater precision, along with faster forming and drainage times,” said Tarik Jabrane, NSERC Industrial Research Chair, Innofibre. “Compared to traditional molded fiber tooling, HP’s tools can be changed quickly and easily, with fewer stops in the workflow. The speed of iteration and ability to change tools enables more prototyping and ultimately provides a more cost effective option for the industry.” “We are proud our efforts to introduce a truly disruptive solution for the packaging industry have been validated by Innofibre’s research,” said Mariona Company, Global Head of Molded Fiber Solutions, HP Inc. “Based on the data released by Innofibre, it is no surprise we are gaining traction with molded fiber manufacturers in Europe, the US and Canada as they look for innovative new tooling options to meet customer demand. This is just the beginning, we are committed to advancing our solution, helping the molded fiber industry grow and accelerating the transition from single use plastics to sustainable packaging.” Market Leading Productivity and New Design Possibilities Molded fiber, also known as molded pulp, is currently used in handling and packaging thousands of renewable products from food containers to packaging of household items and electronics to single-use medical service items. Unveiled in September 2020, HP’s Molded Fiber Advanced Tooling technology enables fast and enhanced design and fabrication of high-performance molded fiber tooling in as quickly as two weeks1 compared to four to six weeks experienced by customers using traditional methods2. Combined with HP’s new tooling production service, the end-to-end solution yields increased production up time, reduced maintenance, and mass customization capabilities. Key findings published by Innofibre confirm that the HP solution delivers a greater number of stronger parts more quickly than traditional tooling. Improved fiber retention resulting in stronger parts: due to its excellent first pass pulp retention, especially of the longest fibers, HP tooling uses less fiber to make parts with greater strength than equal grammage parts from 50-mesh tooling. Significant process efficiencies and cost reduction: due to its superior fiber retention, and faster forming, HP’s solution saves customers time and money - savings equivalent to avoiding having to discard every eleventh egg tray being produced into whitewater. High quality personalized parts: HP digitally designed screens resist wrinkles so customers get parts with crisp edges and borders, and highly personalized, legible markings. New Customers Embracing HP’s Solution Across Industries Several new customers throughout Europe, the United States and Canada across industries including healthcare and electronics have begun using HP’s tooling solution. This builds on collaboration with existing customers including Fiber Innovation, Pacific Pulp, Pulp Moulded Products, and Western Pulp Products Company as well as partners such as PMD and Veritiv who are working on a variety of new designs. Vernacare is a global leader of paper moulding products specializing in high quality single-use medical products committed to innovation. The company is looking to improve efficiency gains, accelerate turnaround times, and increase productivity with HP’s unique rapid screen replacement.“Compared to traditional manufacturing, HP’s solution increases the speed from concept to execution, and has the potential to improve our productivity efficiencies and machine volumes,” said Garry Partington, Research and Development Manager, Vernacare.Polyco Healthline Group specializes in protection and hygiene products and services including disposable gloves, workwear and bags. Polyco has used molded pulp for more than two decades and its Thermofiber division develops non-medical molded pulp accessories. The company is working with HP to develop applications that reduce the amount of plastics used in the industry. Eco Pulp is a Finland-based packaging producer that specializes in technical molded pulp inserts. They are currently using HP’s tooling solution to produce packaging for electronic devices.“Thanks to HP we are increasing our production efficiencies. The middle screen is saving us a lot of time in the production process, it is light, easy to carry, making the process faster and more sustainable,” said Ari Henttonen, Managing Director, Eco Pulp. New customers include Eco Pack, Enviropack, ERI Mexico, YFY Jupiter and many others exploring new use cases using HP tools. HP’s own business, one of the largest manufacturers of consumer tech products in the world, is leveraging the solution to help achieve its sustainability goals, including a commitment to eliminate 75% of single use plastic packaging by 2025. Technology Advancements Unlock New Value for Manufacturers HP’s Molded Fiber Advanced Tooling Solution leverages proprietary HP innovations in digital manufacturing software and data intelligence along with HP’s industry-leading, industrial 3D printing technology to offer a more efficient, optimized digital design experience, replacing the need for handcrafted screens, CNC machining, and manually drilled form tools. As a result of Innofibre’s research and work with partners including PMD, HP has quickly advanced its tooling capabilities, developing enhancements to optimize production processes and create more personalized solutions. These innovative advancements demonstrate HP’s commitment to open up entirely new design opportunities enabling projects that would be impossible using traditional methods due to complex geometries and shallow draft angles. HP AdvancedPro Transfer Tool: a lightweight transfer tool providing an extra digitally designed screen on the transfer side for improved productivity and process efficiency by reducing forming cycle time and moisture content. The tool improves transfer-side smoothness and enables parts with low draft angles as well as custom markings on the transfer side.HP FlowTec SmartScreen: custom screens algorithmically designed to fine tune slurry flow and improve molding performance for challenging geometries.“We started to work with HP because my desire was to have a fluid dynamic approach to the tooling used for molded fiber products. I didn’t have sufficient knowledge of this approach and very few people in the Industry do,” said Jalal Kahn, Head of Design Pulp & Paper Products at Polyco Healthline. HP’s FlowTec SmartScreen is a breakthrough tooling innovation thanks to which we can actually have a more predictable slurry behavior resulting in efficiency gains for molders.” HP at IMFA ConferenceHP will present at the virtual IMFA annual conference from April 13-14, delivering a keynote address together with Eco Pulp, Polyco Healthline Group, and Vernacare. HP will also deliver a technical session together with Innofibre and PMD, providing a deep dive into Innofibre’s research and HP’s technology advancements. On April 20, HP will follow up on its sessions at IMFA with a free, in-depth webinar and Q&A session to discuss opportunities to transform molded fiber packaging with its end-to-end solution.

It says, ‘The Chinese Communist Party is aggressively -- plans to reorient and dominate the semiconductor supply chain,’ and it goes into how much money will be they’re pouring into being able to do that.”Chief executives including General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra, Ford Motor Co. CEO James D. Farley, Jr., and Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google participated in the virtual summit.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the meeting showed the administration is serious about addressing supply-chain constraints and softening the blow for affected companies and workers.National Economic Council director Brian Deese and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan hosted the meeting, with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo also participating. Companies invited to join included Dell Technologies Inc., Intel Corp., Medtronic Plc, Northrop Grumman Corp., HP Inc., Cummins Inc., Micron Technology Inc., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., AT&T Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co., as well as GM, Ford and Alphabet Inc.Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said in an interview after the meeting that the White House and Congress are working aggressively to support the semiconductor industry with more domestic manufacturing, research and development as well as efforts to build the workforce. Taiwan’s TSMC also voiced its support. The contract chipmaker, which plays a central role in manufacturing most of the world’s most advanced semiconductors, has secured government incentives to begin building a $12 billion Arizona plant this year.“TSMC is confident that our 5nm advanced fab plan in Phoenix Arizona -- one of the largest foreign direct investments in U.S. history -- will be successful in partnership with the U.S. government,” it said in a statement.The administration intended to highlight elements of the president’s proposed $2.25 trillion infrastructure-focused plan that they believe would improve supply-chain resilience, a White House official said. The agenda also included discussions about the auto industry’s transition to clean energy, job creation and ensuring U.S. economic competitiveness, the official added.Many of the lawmakers supporting additional funding for semiconductors want to see the measure in a standalone competitiveness bill aimed at China, not as part of Biden’s infrastructure package, as it is now. The China bill has some bipartisan support and could have a quicker path through Congress.Intel, Micron, GM, A&T on Roster for White House Chips MeetingBut exactly how to spend and allocate the semiconductor funding is a source of debate among automakers and other consumers of chips, as well as the semiconductor companies themselves.Carmakers are pushing for a portion of the money to be reserved for vehicle-grade chips, warning of a potential 1.3 million shortfall in car and light-duty truck production in the U.S. this year if their industry isn’t given priority.Yet makers of other electronic devices affected by the chip shortage, such as computers and mobile phones, have taken issue with the carmakers’ demands, worried their industries will suffer. The debate was also a factor in the White House meeting.“There were many, many voices saying, ‘hey, we can’t just start carving things up for particular industries. We need a solution that works in the medium and long term and that are sensitive to some of the unique challenges of the immediate term,’” Gelsinger said in the interview. “I think we’re working pretty well through that process right now. Nobody will be entirely happy but we’re heading in a good direction.”The White House has not taken a public position on the issue but has indicated privately to semiconductor industry leaders that it would not support special treatment for one industry, according to people familiar with the matter.Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which lobbies for Ford, General Motors and Stellantis NV (formerly Fiat Chrysler Automobiles), expressed optimism that the Biden administration would at least consider his industry’s arguments.Congress Weighs Countering China on Chips, GOP Wary of Cost (1)He said the White House has not endorsed any specific plans for setting aside money for carmakers, but administration officials “understand why the proposal was made.”To avoid future chip shortages, Blunt’s group proposed that at least 25% of any federal support for the construction of semiconductor factories must go to U.S. facilities that commit to allocating at least 25% of their capacity to automotive-grade chips.John Neuffer, president and chief executive officer of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said the industry understands “the difficulty the auto sector is feeling right now, and chipmakers are working hard to ramp up production to meet demand in the short term.”For the long term, he said, the industry needs a boost in domestic production and innovation across the board “so all sectors of our economy have access to the chips they need, and that requires swiftly enacting federal investments in semiconductor manufacturing and research.”(Updates with TSMC’s comments from the seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2551306f9a9de308ad993771854efbe2025a53f7257dbbb98dfe86605beaf453

Gary Dugan, chief executive officer at the Global CIO Office in Singapore, along with a few other fund managers echoed Citi’s views.“While we are not sure whether the huge volatility of share price movement of many technology stocks during the last few days could trigger more forced selling pressure or de-risk selling sentiment from other funds in the next few days, we do believe and are reassured that none of the sell-down is fundamental related,” Citi analysts including Alicia Yap wrote in a note.The comments come after Friday’s unprecedented selling in some U.S. stocks ranging from Chinese technology giants to American media conglomerates by the family office of former Tiger Management trader Bill Hwang. The firm, Archegos Capital Management, was forced by its banks to sell more than $20 billion worth of shares after some positions moved against Hwang, according to two people directly familiar with the transactions. The block trades come as Chinese tech shares were already reeling from higher U.S. Treasury yields and mounting regulatory pressure.READ: Tiger Cub Hwang’s Family Office Behind Friday Trade Frenzy Technical, Exaggerated“We would look at the selloff as technical and exaggerated and hence a long-term buying opportunity,” said Dugan of Global CIO Office.Tencent Music, whose ADRs slumped 37% in the last three sessions, announced a $1 billion share buyback on Monday. Baidu has approximately $2.78 billion outstanding share repurchase programs that it could use for buying back the shares, Citi analysts wrote in a note.“Baidu’s growth outlook remains promising,” they wrote. Citi’s price target of $364 on Baidu’s ADRs implies a potential upside of about 75% from Friday’s close.Baidu’s stock, which made its debut in Hong Kong last week, slid 5% on Monday, adding to its 5.6% loss from Friday. A measure of tech shares, which includes many Chinese giants, dropped 1.8% even as the benchmark Hang Seng Index ended little changed.READ: Credit Suisse, Nomura Face Losses as Banks Tally Archegos Damage“We bought some Baidu shares in Hong Kong last Friday,” said Paul Pong, managing director at Pegasus Fund Managers Ltd. “The valuation has turned very attractive. Shares have hit a near-term bottom since the drop has nothing to do with fundamentals. It has earnings growth and the momentum is not bad. It’s the best tech stock to hold if you want to get exposure to the concept of auto-driving.”Michael Foo, chief investment officer at HP Wealth Management, also sees a good buying opportunity in Chinese tech shares.“While there is still room for more downside as valuations contract, we are seeing good value in some of the higher quality blue chip tech stocks with strong free cash flows such as Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba and JD.com,” he said.READ: Down $732 Billion, Chinese Tech Stocks Are Still Far From Cheap(Updates prices throughout.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=931df28b93b33396878b941e0abf1acefdd646bb5293027c54c8eb2ac455326b
