AMD is a semiconductor company that develops computer processors and related technologies for business and consumer markets. The surging demand for data center chips from data center operators, high-performance computing (HPC) applications, gaming, and VR/AR devices due to the coronavirus crisis, is fueling growth for the stock.



With a market capitalization of $102.7 billion, the chipmaker has gained 56.5% in the past year, but has lost 11.8% over the past six months.



AMD, Google Partnership Drives Growth



On Thursday, Alphabet's subsidiary Google Cloud announced that it had picked AMD's third-generation data center chip to offer enhanced cloud computing services to its customers. Per the deal terms, Google will utilize AMD's EPYC processors to power a new group of Tau virtual machines (VMs) within Google Cloud.



AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su said, “We designed 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processors to meet the growing demand from cloud and enterprise customers for high-performance, cost-effective solutions with optimal TCO.”



Su further added, “We work closely with Google Cloud and are proud they selected AMD to exclusively power the new Tau VM T2D instance which provides customers with powerful new options to run their most demanding scale-out workloads.”



The news has sparked enthusiasm among investors and has caused the stock price to surge. (See AMD stock chart on TipRanks)



No EC Objection For Xilinx Purchase 



Per an article on thestreet.com, the European Commission (EC) has not raised any objection to AMD’s buyout of Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX). The news is expected to be one of the major catalysts for the recent increase in the share price.



Last year in October, AMD reached an agreement to buy Xilinx. The deal, which is expected to strengthen AMD’s presence in the data center chip market and increase its overall sales, is expected to close later this year.



Other catalysts might also generate robust growth in the foreseeable future for the company.



FSR Launch Expected to Spur Sales



AMD is set to launch FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) and officially reveal the first supported games on June 22nd. The company aims to boost the performance and image quality in supported games with this new technology. However, the company is yet to disclose further details about it.



The developers and publishers have reportedly already been working with AMD on FSR adoption.



AMD’s FSR is expected to compete with NVIDIA's (NVDA) deep learning super sampling (DLSS) image technology, which helps games look better and run smoother.



The release is expected to help AMD gain a larger market share of the GPU market.



However, whether the new technology will help AMD penetrate the market remains to be seen, as NVDA's DLSS technology has already grabbed a fair share of the market.



Strong Industry Projections



Per a report from IDC, the traditional PC market is expected to grow at 18.2%, with shipments totaling 357.4 million this year. This represents a CAGR of 2.5% from 2020 through 2025.



Also, the video gaming industry has been a big pandemic winner, thanks to a surge in engagement from gamers staying indoors. According to a study by Mordor Intelligence, the global gaming market is projected to reach $314.40 billion by 2026, recording a CAGR of 9.64% from 2021 through 2026.



According to a report from MarketsandMarkets, the global data center power market is expected to reach $26.1 billion by 2025, indicating a CAGR of 6.4% during the period 2020 to 2025.



The strong projections in the personal computer, video gaming, and data center markets are anticipated to spur the demand for AMD’s chips. 



Analysts’ Views



The Wall Street community is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 9 Buys, 7 Holds, and 1 Sell. The AMD average analyst price target of $106.54 implies 26% upside potential from the current levels.



Following the AMD and Google Cloud news announcement, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and a price target of $135. This implies 59.6% upside potential to current levels.



Mosesmann said, “AMD's EPYC 3 is in its early days of volume ramp, and we expect significant share gains in the next several years on superior architectural roadmap and scalability.”



He further added, “We believe AMD deserves a premium P/E multiple on the premise of a CPU/GPU share gain, and dollar content expansion story is multiyear in nature. We see earnings power of over $4.50 in 2022, and over $5.50 in 2023.”



On June 11, Northland Securities analyst Gus Richard reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and a price target of $116.00. This implies 37.2% upside potential to current levels.



Richard commented, “In notebooks, AMD's revenue share is growing faster than its unit share. We expect an increasing mix of corporate notebook revenue to drive client revenue growth in 2H. AMD's server market share accelerated in Q1 and AMD launched its 7nm server chip in Q1 that will likely accelerate share gains in 2H. We believe AMD is getting ample capacity from TSMC, and high-end AMD systems will be the least likely to suffer from component shortages.”



TipRanks Vital Metrics



TipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 87% Bullish on AMD, compared to a sector average of 69%.



TipRanks’ Stock Investors tool shows that investors currently have a Very Positive stance on Advanced Micro Devices, with 3.2% of investors increasing their exposure to AMD stock over the past 30 days.

Silexica’s solutions enable developers to build applications on FPGAs and Adaptive SoCs. Xilinx will be integrating these tools and solutions with the Xilinx Vitis platform which will reduce the learning curve for software developers.



Salil Raje, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Data Center Group, Xilinx said, “Software programmability is imperative to our long-term goal to accelerate the path from software to application-optimized hardware systems.” (See Xilinx stock analysis on TipRanks)



Raje added, “Silexica’s technology complements our existing Vitis solution and roadmap and will accelerate our ability to attract a wider range of developers seeking to leverage our heterogeneous computing architectures.”



Silexica’s SLX FPGA suite utilizes synthesis tools from Xilinx which allows designing at higher abstraction, faster simulation, and high-level optimizations.



Silexica former CEO Maximilian Odendahl added, “The integration of our technology with the Xilinx Vitis portfolio fully aligns with our goal of making adaptive computing accessible to software developers.”



Last month, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann reiterated a Hold rating on the stock and a $130 price target.



The pending all-stock acquisition of Xilinx by AMD for $35 billion is expected to close by the end of 2021. Mosesmann commented, “We continue to believe the AMD takeover of Xilinx is a great strategic fit that gets the combined companies to address a $110 billion TAM.”



Based on 5 unanimous Holds, consensus among analysts is a Hold. Shares have gained about 32.1% over the past year.

AMD stock saw the biggest highs over the past year and was very close to hitting triple digits. The stock hit an all-time high of more than $99 in 2020. However, thanks to volatility the stock is far from its peak. This is a great opportunity to buy AMD stock. Source: Fabio Alcini / Shutterstock.com The stock is trading at around $80 today. It could certainly be the best growth stock for the year. I believe the company will get a push in 2021 with the strong first quarter results and the recently announced share buyback plan. With that in mind, let’s take a look at the investment case for AMD stock. AMD Stock: Stellar Q1 results AMD recently reported Q1 results passing analysts expectations and raising hope about the future of the company. The revenue stood at $3.45 billion which is a 93% rise year over year and a 6% rise over the last quarter. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The gross margin was 46% which is constant year over year while the operating income was $662 million as compared to an operating income of $177 million a year ago, showing a 223% rise year over year. Higher revenue led to a rise in the operating income for the quarter. Further, the net income of the company stood at $555 million as compared to $162 million a year back, up 243% year over year. The cash balance at the end of the quarter was $3.12 billion. AMD certainly had a blow-out quarter and the numbers are proof. It beat analyst estimates and has hit new highs in revenue and operating income. AMD went from $2 billion in 2014 to $90 billion in market value in 2021. The 7 Best Stocks to Ride the Roaring Commodities Rally For the second quarter, the company expects revenue to hit $3.6 billion, which is an 86% increase year over year. For the full year, the company expects revenue growth of 50% over 2020. It expects the growth to be driven by all businesses. Further, AMD is supposed to complete the $35 billion merger with Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) later in the year. This merger could be game-changing for the company. In the recent quarterly reports, Xilinx beat expectations and reported a profit of 82 cents per share. There is a 13% rise in revenue amounting to $851 million, which is a record for the company. It also reported a net income of $188 million for the fourth quarter and full-year earnings of $2.62 per share. The numbers are right before the planned merger and it shows the tremendous potential of the company once the merger is complete. The decision about the same will be taken by July 6. $4 billion buyback plan AMD made strong headlines after announcing the first buyback plan worth $4 million since 2001. The repurchase will not be funded by debt, but rather by the cash generation of the company. AMD is enjoying one of its best years and riding a massive success wave. It is growing across all fronts with the success in Ryzen gaming. The revenue has been consistently growing since 2017 and is accelerating with each passing year. With revenue, the company’s cash flow margin is consistently growing displaying the strength of its products. If the company continues to grow at the same pace, it will be worth much more in the next two years and AMD stock will hit a new peak. Currently, the company has a cash balance of $3.12 billion and it will easily have a free cash flow of $4 billion and can complete the buyback program through cash generation. The Bottom Line on AMD stock The strong fundamentals and a stronghold in the market make AMD the perfect growth stock. Considering the growth in sales and revenue across all products, the company could report new highs this year and AMD stock could hit $100. If AMD can continue to grow market share like it has been doing in the past, it will certainly reward investors. If you are looking for a growth stock to add to your portfolio, buy AMD stock and hold it forever.

company,1622188800,Carmakers Forced by Chip Crisis to Rethink Just-In-Time Ordering,68026124,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eBIHb1heVQxNwVk541MqXw--~B/aD03NDg7dz0xMjk2O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/6f8f942de80af81cc71614ae2cb8d1dd,XLNX,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- A century after automakers showed the world the value of assembly-line manufacturing, a shortage of semiconductors is teaching the industry a painful new lesson in what it takes to build a car.For most of its history, the industry has relied on a distinct approach to buying car parts, procuring components from suppliers right at the moment they’re needed. It’s referred to as just-in-time manufacturing and is designed to streamline production and eliminate the costs of keeping warehouses stocked with parts waiting to be used.But the shortcomings of that system were made starkly clear this year as the automakers confronted a dearth of the chips they need to build advanced functions into their vehicles, and found themselves near the bottom of chipmakers’ customer lists because of their just-in-time approach. That shortage is threatening to cut $110 billion in sales from the industry, and forcing auto manufacturers to overhaul the way they get the electronic components that have become critical to contemporary car design.“Customers need to change,” said Hassane El-Khoury, chief executive officer of ON Semiconductor Corp., which gets more than a third of its revenue from the automotive market. “That just-in-time mindset doesn’t work.”Semiconductor makers are demanding guaranteed, long-term orders rather than the short-term flexibility the carmakers are used to. The chipmakers’ assertiveness, even under pressure from lawmakers, underscores the rebalancing of power from the companies whose logos are on the cars to those that provide the advanced technology that runs them.As these components play a bigger role in everything from in-car entertainment to self-driving functions, chip manufacturers say they’re willing to invest in expanding production to head off a repeat of shortages that have forced the industry to mothball factories and furlough workers -- if the carmakers give them orders that can’t be canceled and commit to long-term agreements.“Why would I have invested a single dollar when my customer can cancel within 30 days and it takes me two years to build capacity?” ON Semiconductor’s El-Khoury said.There are signs the industry is listening. Last week, Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley indicated a new willingness to reverse decades of outsourcing for parts.“As the industry changes, we have to in-source now, just like we in-sourced powertrains in the ’20s and ’30s,” said Farley, who has shut down half his factories and seen his dealers’ lots emptying because of a dearth of chips.Most components used by the auto industry are part of a discrete food chain, and carmakers are at the top, able to orchestrate their suppliers’ actions in a system that delivers them a set of components that can be put together quickly and cheaply into a finished vehicle. Electronics makers, who’ve fared much better in the chip supply crunch, regard semiconductors as essential systems, and they work directly with chipmakers to secure products and often design their devices around the chips themselves.Automakers can no longer “assume the dominance of an 800-pound gorilla” in negotiations with chip companies and battery makers, said Mark Wakefield, head of the auto practice at consultancy AlixParters.Pioneered by Toyota Motor Corp. in the 1960s, just-in-time is a system where components suppliers are required to turn up with whatever the carmakers want at the last possible moment in a process that pares costs to the very minimum.That strategy has served the industry well, saving money and helping it organize a system for sourcing the 40,000 or so components that go into a modern vehicle, many of which can be made in a matter of days. But semiconductors -- the heart of sensors, engine management and battery controllers, infotainment and eventually systems that will pilot vehicles -- are created in a process that takes months. And building and equipping a factory to produce them requires years.Today’s cars contain an average of 1,400 semiconductors -- and that puts the chipmakers at an advantage. Ford’s Farley said he’s now negotiating contracts directly with chipmakers -- bypassing his traditional auto suppliers -- while building up inventory of the precious pieces and even redesigning models to accommodate the semiconductor companies.“We have learned a lot through this crisis that can be applied to many critical components,” Farley told analysts last month as he announced Ford would lose half its production in the second quarter and take a $2.5 billion hit to earnings this year, citing a lack of chips. “We’re also thinking about what this means for the world of batteries and silicon and all sorts of other components that are really mission critical for our company.”Ford is not alone in seeking solutions that upend long-time industry practices. Automakers from General Motors Co. to Volkswagen AG to Tesla Inc. are looking for ways to get closer to the chipmaking process, which could include forming partnerships with semiconductor companies, bringing chipmaking in-house and even building their own foundries. Nothing is off the table.“Cars are only going to get more technical and they’re going to need more chips,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president of vehicle forecasting at consultant AutoForecast Solutions. “All of the vehicle manufacturers are looking at every possible scenario for getting it solved for the long-term.”But according to some chipmakers, the auto industry has embraced new technology but failed to understand those that supply it.“There is a huge difference between manufacturing a car and manufacturing a chip,” said Kurt Sievers, CEO of NXP Semiconductor NV, the biggest maker of auto chips. “We’ve been working for years closely with the auto OEMs directly when it comes to R&D and innovation -- however, not at all for supply chain and volume forecasting.”Sievers said the chip industry wants specific forecasts that stretch out in years and binding commitments to buy chips that last that long. The way automakers, referred to as original equipment manufacturers or OEMs, and semiconductor vendors work together needs to change, he said.And the car companies have little choice but to do so. Consumers are increasingly choosing vehicles based on functions such as connectivity, entertainment and advanced automated safety features. The auto industry is steadily shifting away from gasoline to battery power. All of that requires more chips.“It’s no longer this subsystem that no one cares about,” said Victor Peng, CEO of Xilinx Inc. a chipmaker whose products are uses in advanced driver-assistance systems. “The electronics is really going to shape the customer experience.”The semiconductor industry has plenty of other orders to fill. In 2020 automakers bought almost $40 billion worth of chips, little changed from the prior year, even amid the crash of the pandemic. By comparison, the computer industry bought 17% more chips than it did in 2019, for a total of $160 billion. Phone makers, meantime, provided the chip industry with $137 billion in revenue, a jump of 12%.Earlier this year, automakers lobbied U.S. lawmakers to intervene to help them with the shortage, arguing that chipmakers were unfairly prioritizing customers building less important consumer electronics over cars. The automakers argue their industry creates more than 7 million jobs in America and is critical to national security. And they’ve found a sympathetic ear in President Joe Biden, who was supported by the United Auto Workers in the 2020 election, and is working to help the auto industry navigate the chip crisis.Still, consumer electronics buys $20 billion more chips a year than the auto industry, and Big Tech has plenty of clout in Washington, too.Chipmakers are also in no hurry to add new factories to meet this year’s chip rush. Though 2020 was a good year and 2021 is shaping up to be even better, they don’t have to look back very far to be reminded of the difficulties of matching supply with short-term fluctuations in demand. In 2019 industry sales shrank 12% as customers slashed orders to work through stockpiles.Many investors and analysts are already concerned that what now looks like insatiable demand is customers double-ordering: asking for twice the amount they need so they can at least get the number they want. In the past, such heavy ordering has proved to foreshadow industry gluts, with demand eventually easing and buyers tapping the brakes as they worked down accumulated inventory.“We came out of 2018 guns blazing, everybody hoarded, and then 2019 was an awful year of demand because they already had chips,” said ON Semiconductor’s El Khoury. “Here we are today with people looking at us and asking, ‘why haven’t you invested?’”The type of chip automakers want also works against them. Much of what they use -- things such as sensors and power regulators -- can be made on what’s called lagging nodes, or production technology that hasn’t been state-of-the-art for years. While that makes it cheaper, chipmakers are reluctant to expand capacity of technology that’s closer to being obsolete.“The chips that the automotive industry uses are older than the ones you’d find in your cell phones or in your video games,” said AutoForecast Solutions’ Fiorani. “That makes them less of a priority to the companies that produce them.”Fiorani said carmakers would be better served forming joint ventures with chipmakers to tap their expertise and lock down a dependable source of supply. But doing that would involve going around traditional suppliers such as Continental AG and Robert Bosch AG and turning back the clock to a more expensive time when companies like Ford had to deal with suppliers for raw materials.Some auto suppliers are already taking steps to make sure they don’t get cut out. Parts supplier Robert Bosch is opening a new chip factory in Dresden that it says is the first of its kind dedicated to manufacturing semiconductors for automotive uses. Still, some automakers are already talking openly about cutting out those middlemen in order to keep up with the speed of change.“We will be the one who has the commercial relationship with the chipmaker,” Volvo Cars CEO Hakan Samuelsson said at a mobility conference in Tel Aviv this month. “When we want a change and you have to talk to suppliers, it is too slow.”Ford’s Farley said he’s consulted with tech companies and discovered how common it is in other industries to keep “buffer stock” and to buy directly from chip manufacturers.“Even if the company still buys the components with chips on them from a supplier, they still negotiated a direct deal,” he told analysts, describing something that’s common practice for companies like Apple Inc. Ford learned that nine of its tier-one component suppliers rely on just one Renesas Electronics Corp. factory in Japan for chips, a plant that suffered a fire, he said.Some automakers have made rapid progress in understanding their newer suppliers and are negotiating long-term deals. Others are sticking to the belief that they can dictate how their suppliers should act, according to ON Semiconductor’s El-Khoudry.Learning from their current difficulties is the key to turning around the current crisis and avoiding the next, according to Xilinx’s Peng. Toyota, the inventor of just-in-time, said it expects to return to pre-pandemic levels of profitability as soon as this year, helped by factories that continue to churn out vehicles because the company made the decision to accumulate stockpiles of chips.“People have to think differently or they’re going to be left behind,” Peng said.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c5f5668092f78186f4d39d4d8b30a36c61728a7c398a0f5b01d17010b3a5d06f

These risks include, among other things: failure to obtain applicable regulatory or stockholder approvals in a timely manner or otherwise; failure to satisfy other closing conditions to the transaction or to complete the transaction on anticipated terms and timing; risks that the businesses will not be integrated successfully or that the combined company will not realize expected benefits, cost savings, accretion, synergies and/or growth, or that such benefits may take longer to realize than expected; the risk that disruptions from the transaction will harm business plans and operations; risks relating to unanticipated costs of integration; significant transaction and/or integration costs, or difficulties in connection with the transaction and/or unknown or inestimable liabilities; restrictions during the pendency of the transaction that may impact the ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions; litigation associated with the transaction; the potential impact of the consummation of the transaction on AMD’s, Xilinx’s or the combined company’s relationships with suppliers, customers, employers and regulators; and demand for the combined company’s products. A more fulsome discussion of the risks related to the proposed transaction is included in the joint proxy statement/prospectus. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by forward-looking statements, see the section captioned “Risk Factors” in (i) AMD’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2020 and AMD’s other filings with the SEC and (ii) Xilinx’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 28, 2020, Xilinx’s subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Xilinx’s other filings with the SEC. While the lists of factors presented here and in the joint proxy statement/prospectus are considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. Many of these risks and uncertainties may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment as a result. Neither AMD nor Xilinx assumes, and each hereby disclaims, any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as may be required by law.
