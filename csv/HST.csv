(HST), a real estate investment trust that invests in hotels, has announced the acquisition of Baker’s Cay Resort Key Largo, Curio Collection for about $200 million. 



Following the news release, shares of the company dipped 3% in Tuesday’s trading session. However, it recovered some of the losses marginally to close at $16.85 in the extended trading session.



The purchase price of the property, which comprises a 26,000 square foot of meeting space, including a 6,900 square foot event lawn and four food and beverage outlets, denotes a 6.2% capitalization rate and a 14.5x EBITDA multiple based on 2021 property forecasts.



The CEO of Host Hotels & Resorts, James F. Risoleo, said, “We are pleased to announce the off-market acquisition of our first hotel in the Florida Keys, which we believe will improve the EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio. After a complete $63 million renovation and repositioning in 2019, Baker’s Cay shows like a new resort. Additionally, the Florida Keys market benefits from excellent supply-demand dynamics owing in part to strict development ordinances, which have led to the highest 2019 upper-upscale RevPAR of any market in the US. We expect this resort to deliver over $300 of RevPAR and $69,000 of EBITDA per key in 2021, ranking eighth on both metrics in Host’s 2019 pro forma portfolio.” (See Host Hotels & Resorts stock chart on TipRanks)



Recently, BTIG analyst James W Sullivan reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $19. The analyst’s price target implies upside potential of 13.6% from current levels.



The stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 6 Buys, 3 Holds and 1 Sell. The average Host Hotels & Resorts price target of $19.06 implies 13.9% upside potential from current levels.

Located within Walt Disney World® Resort, one of the most visited destination resorts in the world, the hotel sits on 289 acres, provides complimentary transport to four Walt Disney World® Resort theme parks, and is the only AAA Five Diamond-rated hotel in Central Florida. James F. Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort is a truly iconic and irreplaceable property that is well-positioned to benefit from significant demand as the pandemic subsides and the 18-month celebration of Walt Disney World’s 50th anniversary begins in October. A strong market leader with a 2019 RevPAR Index over 215, this resort is now Host Hotels’ highest-ranked property based on 2019 RevPAR and Total RevPAR, and fifth highest based on EBITDA per key.” Risoleo continued, “Our ability to execute on this off-market acquisition underscores the benefits of our prudent and disciplined capital allocation approach that emphasized maximizing balance sheet capacity and liquidity toward the end of the cycle. Our strong financial foundation of $2.5 billion in total available liquidity at year-2020, including FF&E reserves, has enabled us to invest in high-quality properties that we expect to elevate our EBITDA growth profile and create long-term value for our shareholders and other stakeholders.” Valuation Metrics: Acquired for $610 million or $1.4 million per key, representing a 4.7% capitalization rate, 16.8x EBITDA multiple based on 2019 results1 2019 Resort Performance: Generated RevPAR of $561, Total RevPAR of $923 and EBITDA/key of $81,5002, which represents 90% growth since 2016 Resort Amenities: Include 55,000 square feet of meeting space, six food and beverage outlets, five pools, three tennis courts, a 13,000 square foot spa, an 18-hole golf course and golf club, and Explorer Island, a five-acre family-oriented water park / entertainment area Walt Disney World® Resort: Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort offers complimentary transport to four Walt Disney World® Resort theme parks, on-site character breakfast, in-room celebrations, and a Disney Planning Center. _______________1 Consistent with industry standard, we calculate the capitalization rate as the ratio of property’s net operating income to its purchase price and the EBITDA multiple as the ratio of the purchase price to the property’s EBITDA.

James F. Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We significantly exceeded our expectations in the first quarter, and returned to profitability at the hotel level for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. As a result, for the quarter, while we recorded a GAAP net loss, we delivered positive Adjusted EBITDAre. As vaccine deployment accelerated and lockdowns eased across the nation, our portfolio continued to gather revenue momentum through February and inflected sharply upward in March, with Spring break travel driving high-rated leisure demand to our luxury resorts in the Sunbelt and other key leisure destinations.” Risoleo continued, “With the lodging recovery underway, we are pleased to have completed the acquisitions of the Hyatt Regency Austin and Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort for a total of $771 million. These high-quality properties, located in attractive growth markets with strong demand drivers, are expected to benefit from robust recovery trajectories and are already performing better than we anticipated. In addition to executing meaningful acquisitions this year, we continue to work on redefining our hotel operating model with our managers and positioning our properties to gain market share, key strategic objectives that we believe will accelerate our recovery and strengthen our ability to deliver long-term growth for our stockholders. Overall, we are pleased to end the first quarter following the most challenging year in lodging history feeling optimistic about the recovery in travel and excited about our relative strength at the beginning of the new lodging cycle.” Highlights: Results for First Quarter 2021 Recorded a GAAP net loss of $153 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to a net loss of $66 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, which benefited from a $195 million gain on sale of assets.Achieved positive All Owned Hotel Pro Forma EBITDA of $21 million in the first quarter of 2021, due to a sequential improvement in RevPAR and operations.

The sequential improvement was primarily due to strong leisure demand for resorts and hotels located in the Company’s Sunbelt markets and Hawaii. Average room rates declined by just 9% compared to the first quarter of 2019 and improved by 18% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.Average occupancy declined by 49.3 percentage points compared to the first quarter of 2019 and improved seven percentage points compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Hotel Operating Expense Performance First Quarter 2021 Portfolio-wide hotel operating costs, excluding severance, were nearly 60% lower compared to the first quarter of 2019, and only 15% higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, despite an approximately 50% increase in total revenues quarter over quarter.Due to the stronger than expected demand surge in March, the ramp up of staffing at several properties was unable to keep pace. The Company expects hotel operating costs to increase more in line with total revenues as hotels transition from their contingency level operational plans to increasing staffing levels and controllable spending.Furloughed employees received healthcare benefits of approximately $12 million that were accrued in the fourth quarter of 2020.In addition, the Company’s hotel operators recorded a $7 million credit related to the Employee Retention Credit in the first quarter, that, under the CARES Act, partially offset the costs for the operator’s furloughed hotel employees and reduced hotel-level operating expenses. Operating Expense Trends Benefit costs for furloughed employees during the second and third quarter of 2021 are not expected to have a significant impact on results as they will be eligible to be reimbursed through the American Rescue Plan Act.Re-introduction of marketing, maintenance and other support costs are expected to increase other departmental and support expenses as the recovery continues to gain momentum. Hotel Business Mix Update The Company’s customers fall into three broad groups: transient, group and contract business, which accounted for approximately 61%, 35%, and 4%, respectively, of its 2019 room sales. During the first quarter, demand continued to be primarily driven by leisure demand at drive-to and resort destinations. The following are the sequential results of the Company’s consolidated portfolio, including all owned hotels at March 31, 2021, for transient, group and contract business in comparison to 2019 performance: Quarter endedMarch 31, 2021 Quarter endedDecember 31, 2020 Transient Group Contract Transient Group Contract Room nights (in thousands) 767 264 89 595 157 87 Percentage change in room nights vs same period in 2019 (56.4)% (79.2)% (43.0)% (70.0)% (86.1)% (44.7)%Room Revenues (in millions) $205 $41 $13 $128 $24 $12 Percentage change in revenues vs.same period in 2019 (55.3)% (87.0)% (62.1)% (74.9)% (91.0)% (62.8)% Capital Expenditures The following presents the Company’s 2021 capital expenditures spend and forecast for full year 2021 (in millions): Quarter ended March 31, 2021 2021 Full Year Forecast Actuals Low-end of range High-end of rangeROI - Marriott transformational capital program $28 $110 $140ROI - All other ROI projects 33 165 185Total ROI project spend 61 275 325Renewals and Replacements 32 100 150Total Capital Expenditures $93 $375 $475 The Company is utilizing the low occupancy environment to accelerate certain projects and minimize future disruption and believes the renovations will position these hotels to capture additional revenue during the economic recovery. The Company recently completed The Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island renovation as part of the Marriott transformational capital program, bringing the total number of completed properties to eight, and is on track to complete 85% of this program by the end of 2021. The Company expects to receive approximately $15 million in operating profit guarantees in 2021 under the Marriott transformational capital program, including $5 million that was received in the first quarter. Balance Sheet The Company maintains a robust balance sheet that had the following balances at March 31, 2021: Total assets of $12.7 billion.Total available liquidity of approximately $2.1 billion, including FF&E escrow reserves of $131 million.Debt balance of $5.5 billion, with an average maturity of 4.7 years, an average interest rate of 3.0%, and no maturities until 2023. Following the property transactions completed subsequent to quarter end, the Company’s adjusted total available liquidity was approximately $1.5 billion, including the FF&E escrow reserves. As the Company’s prior “at-the-market” offering program for shares of common stock has expired, the Company intends to enter into a distribution agreement after filing its quarterly report with the SEC by which the Company may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $600 million. The shares would be offered and sold through sales agents in transactions that are deemed to be “at the market” offerings at then-current market prices. The Company is not obligated to sell any shares and considers the “at the market” stock offering program as one tool, among others, to raise capital when the Company believes conditions are advantageous and there is a compelling use of proceeds, including future potential acquisitions. On February 9, 2021, the Company amended its credit facility for the second time during the pandemic to further extend the covenant waiver period through the first quarter of 2022. Financial covenant testing will resume for the second quarter of 2022, based on annualized results for the quarter, but only a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0x will be required for the second quarter of 2022. For subsequent quarters, all financial covenants will be tested, with the leverage ratio tested at the modified levels agreed to in the second amendment. Quarterly dividends and stock repurchases also remain suspended to help preserve liquidity and are restricted under the terms of the credit facility amendments. 2021 Outlook Given the global economic uncertainty COVID-19 has created for the travel, airline, lodging and tourism and event industries, among others, the Company cannot provide guidance for its operations or fully estimate the effect of COVID-19 and the current U.S. vaccination deployment on its operations. The Company believes that recovery within the lodging industry will be driven by increased confidence that the risks associated with travelling and contracting COVID-19 have been significantly reduced through vaccine deployment and the lifting of government restrictions. While the Company is not providing guidance on operations at this time, it estimates that for full year 2021, interest expense and corporate and other expenses will be in the following ranges (in millions): Full Year 2021 Low end of range High end of range Interest expense $170 $180 Corporate and other expenses 98 100 The Company does not intend to provide further guidance updates unless deemed appropriate.

However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on operations there is little comparability between periods. For this reason, we temporarily are revising our presentation to instead present hotel operating results for all consolidated hotels and, to facilitate comparisons between periods, we are presenting results on a pro forma basis including the following adjustments: (1) operating results are presented for all consolidated properties owned as of March 31, 2021 but do not include the results of operations for properties sold through the reporting date; and (2) operating results for acquisitions as of March 31, 2021 are reflected for full calendar years, to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. See the Notes to Financial Information – All Owned Hotel Pro Forma Operating Statistics and Results for further information on these pro forma statistics and – Constant US$ and Nominal US$ for a discussion on constant US$ presentation. Nominal US$ results include the effect of currency fluctuations, consistent with our financial statement presentation. The AC Hotel Scottsdale North is a new development hotel that opened in January 2021. Therefore, there were no operations for the hotel prior to January 2021 and no adjustments made for pro forma results of the hotel for periods prior to its opening. CBD of a location refers to the central business district.(2)Hotel RevPAR is calculated as room revenues divided by the available room nights. Hotel Total RevPAR is calculated by dividing the sum of rooms, food and beverage and other revenues by the available room nights. HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC.

GAAP profit margins are calculated using amounts presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Hotel margins are calculated using amounts presented in the above tables.(3)Pro forma adjustments represent the following items: (i) the elimination of results of operations of our sold hotels, which operations are included in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations as continuing operations and (ii) the addition of results for periods prior to our ownership for hotels acquired as of March 31, 2021. All Owned Hotel Pro Forma results also includes the results of our leased office buildings and other non-hotel revenue and expense items.(4)All Owned Hotel Pro Forma EBITDA excludes the Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort, as it was acquired subsequent to quarter end. Additionally, the AC Hotel Scottsdale North is a new development hotel that opened in January 2021. Therefore, there were no operations for the hotel prior to January 2021 and no adjustments made for pro forma results of the hotel for periods prior to its opening.

Notes to financial Information All Owned Hotel Pro Forma Operating Statistics and Results To facilitate a quarter-to-quarter comparison of our operations, we typically present certain operating statistics (i.e., Total RevPAR, RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses, hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in this presentation on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance (discussed in “Hotel Property Level Operating Results” below). However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on operations, there is little comparability between periods. For this reason, we temporarily are suspending our comparable hotel presentation and instead present hotel operating results for all consolidated hotels and, to facilitate comparisons between periods, we are presenting results on a pro forma basis, including the following adjustments: (1) operating results are presented for all consolidated hotels owned as of March 31, 2021, but do not include the results of operations for properties sold through the reporting date; and (2) operating results for acquisitions as of March 31, 2021 are reflected for full calendar years, to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Constant US$ and Nominal US$ Operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction, or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. For comparative purposes, we also present the RevPAR results for the prior year assuming the results of our foreign operations were translated using the same exchange rates that were effective for the comparable periods in the current year, thereby eliminating the effect of currency fluctuation for the year-over-year comparisons. We believe this presentation is useful to investors as it provides clarity with respect to the change in RevPAR in the local currency of the hotel consistent with the manner in which we would evaluate our domestic portfolio. However, the estimated effect of changes in foreign currency has been reflected in the results of net income (loss), EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAre, diluted earnings (loss) per common share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share. Nominal US$ results include the effect of currency fluctuations, consistent with our financial statement presentation. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Included in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted), (ii) EBITDA, (iii) EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre, (iv) All Owned Hotel Pro Forma Operating Statistics and Results and (v) Cash burn. The following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance. NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period, as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period, in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted NAREIT’s definition of FFO included in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis. We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, amortization, impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs, even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement, the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons, NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance. Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance, in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share, when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT, provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share: Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt, including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.Severance Expense –In certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include, but are not limited to, (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business. In unusual circumstances, we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example, in 2017, as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and to increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our on-going operating performance and, therefore, we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO. EBITDA Earnings before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and, like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs. EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre We present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines, as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate,” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the Company’s results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control), impairment expense of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates. We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre: Property Insurance Gains – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition, property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.Severance Expense – In certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include, but are not limited to, (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business. In unusual circumstances, we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim. Limitations on the Use of NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share, Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share, EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre We calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs, they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre, which are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures), interest expense (for EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only), severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been, and will be, made and are not reflected in the EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows (“Statements of Cash Flows”) in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, NAREIT FFO per diluted share, Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure, and should not be used as a measure of, amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit. Similarly, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in seven domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 10 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners, we do not control and, therefore, do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by outside partners, and a 15% interest held by outside partners in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and, therefore, consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre were calculated as set forth in the definitions above. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities. Hotel Property Level Operating Results We present certain operating results for our hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses, food and beverage profit, and EBITDA (and the related margins), on a hotel-level pro forma basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our hotel results reflect the operating results of our hotels as discussed in “All Owned Hotel Pro Forma Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present all owned hotel pro forma EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our hotels after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our hotels. All owned hotel pro forma results are presented both by location and for the Company’s properties in the aggregate. While severance expense is not uncommon at the individual property level in the normal course of business, we eliminate from our hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business, as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because, even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses, these non-cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier, because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient. Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses, gains or losses on disposition, certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense, the hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses, operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance. While management believes that presentation of all owned hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on all owned hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons, we believe all owned hotel operating results, when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful information to investors and management. The following presents the reconciliation of our Net Loss to All Owned Hotels Pro Forma EBITDA (in millions) for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 and is included as All Owned Hotels Pro Forma EBITDA is a component of fourth quarter cash burn. For additional reconciliations of All Owned Hotels Pro Forma EBITDA for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 and comparable quarters in prior years, see page 13: Quarter endedDecember 31, 2020 Net loss $(66) Depreciation and amortization 167 Interest expense 51 Provision for income taxes (64) Gain on sale of property and corporate level income/expense (171) Severance at hotel properties 21 All Owned Hotels Pro Forma EBITDA $(62) COVID-19 Non-GAAP Reporting Measures Cash Burn. Management utilizes the cash burn metric to evaluate the amounts necessary to fund operating losses during periods where hotels have suspended operations or are operating at very low levels of occupancy due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, management believes this metric is helpful to investors to evaluate the Company's ongoing ability to continue to fund operating losses during the current periods of operating losses. The Company defines cash burn as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities adjusted for (i) changes in short term assets and liabilities and (ii) contributions to equity investments, plus capital expenditures, as further described below. Cash burn is not intended to be, and should not be used as a substitute for GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities as it does not reflect the issuance or repurchase of equity, the payment of dividends, the issuance or repayment of debt, or other investing activities such as the purchase or sale of hotels. Adjustments include: Changes in short term assets and liabilities – The Company eliminates changes in short-term assets and liabilities, including due from managers, other assets and other liabilities, that primarily represent timing of cash inflows and outflows. As a result, cash burn includes income and expenses in better alignment with how these items are reflected on the statements of operations. These items generally represent receipts and payments that will be settled within the year and do not reflect the cash savings or liquidity needs of the Company on an on-going basis.Contributions to equity investments – The Company includes contributions to equity investments that have been necessary due to the depressed operations for these investments during the COVID-19 pandemic. These contributions are included as investing activities on the Statements of Cash Flows.Capital Expenditures – Capital expenditures are included in the cash burn amount as they represent a significant on-going cash outflow of the Company. While management continually evaluates its capital expenditures program to appropriately balance improving and renewing its hotel portfolio with its overall cash needs; management continues to anticipate capital expenditures to be a significant cash outflow. The following presents the reconciliation of our net cash used in operating activities from our Statements of Cash Flows to cash burn (in millions): Quarter ended March 31, 2021 Quarter ended December 31, 2020 GAAP net cash used in operating activities $(49) $(143) Contributions to equity investments (2) (1) Timing adjustments Change in due from/to managers 1 21 Change in other assets (3) (21) Change in other liabilities 8 (5) Cash burn excluding capital expenditures (45) (149) Capital expenditures (93) (115) Cash burn $(138) $(264) SOURAV GHOSHTEJAL ENGMANChief Financial OfficerInvestor Relations(240) 744-5267(240) 744-5116 ir@hosthotels.com A PDF accompanying this announcement is available at: http://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/fafed517-c9d4-45a6-a599-1a2d6d687fca",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3be9b44cbede216b2c2b04f47108b9e1bd568c72738d22d15ddbf3345b84d925

Reject “Mini-Tender” Offer by MacKenzie Capital Management, LP",66395222,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/26VPy4Gw3o37zxF42xO9uQ--~B/aD01ODA7dz03NTA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/globenewswire.com/0157cc54672fa72d759797cc10f3c0ff,HST,Yahoo,"BETHESDA, Md., April 01, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NASDAQ: HST) (the “Company”) has learned that MacKenzie Capital Management, LP (“Purchaser”) made an unsolicited “mini-tender” offer for up to 90,000 operating partnership units (“OP Units”) of Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. (“Host L.P.”) at a price of $12.27 per OP Unit less cash distributions made by Host L.P. after February 28, 2021 (the “MacKenzie Offer”). This follows multiple earlier “mini-tender” offers by the Purchaser launched between 2016 and 2020. Neither the Company nor Host L.P. are in any way associated with the MacKenzie Offer, and holders of OP Units are under no obligation to take any action with respect to the MacKenzie Offer. Mini-tender offers seek less than 5 percent of a company’s outstanding equity. This allows the offering company to avoid many of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) disclosure and procedural requirements for tender offers. The SEC’s guidance to investors on “mini-tender” offers is available at www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/minitend.htm. This guidance advises that mini-tender offers “have been increasingly used to catch investors off guard” and that investors “may end up selling their securities at below-market prices.” After careful evaluation of the MacKenzie Offer, the Company and Host L.P. recommend that the holders of OP Units reject this unsolicited offer. In making this recommendation, the Company primarily considered that the offer price in the MacKenzie Offer is below the $16.85 per share closing stock price of the Company’s common stock on March 31, 2021. Although there is no trading market for the OP Units themselves, at any time holders of OP Units may request that the Company redeem their OP Units and the Company will issue 1.021494 shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for each OP Unit, which shares may then be sold. Based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on March 31, 2021 of $16.85, an OP Unitholder would receive shares with a market value of approximately $17.21 compared to the cash MacKenzie Offer of $12.27. The Purchaser has made many similar unsolicited mini-tender offers for equity of other companies and multiple earlier unsolicited mini-tender offers to holders of Host L.P. units at a similar discount to current market value. Like its other offers, this offer puts individual investors at risk because they may not realize they are selling their OP Units at a discount. The Company urges investors to get current quotes for the Company’s common stock for which their OP Units may be redeemed, consult their financial and tax advisors and exercise caution with respect to the MacKenzie Offer. The Company recommends that OP Unitholders who have not responded to the Purchaser’s offer take no action. The Company encourages brokers and dealers, as well as other market participants, to review the SEC’s letter regarding broker-dealer mini-tender offer dissemination and disclosure at: http://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/minitenders/sia072401.htm. Holders of OP Units should consult with their personal financial advisor or other legal, tax or investment professional(s) regarding any questions they may have. The Company requests that broker dealers, and other market participants, include a copy of this press release with all distributions to their clients of materials related to the MacKenzie Offer.

(NASDAQ: HST) (the “Company”), the nation’s largest lodging real estate investment trust (“REIT”), today announced that it has acquired the fee simple interest in the 448-room Hyatt Regency Austin in Austin, Texas for approximately $161 million in cash. The purchase price represents a 10.0% capitalization rate and an 8.8x EBITDA multiple based on 2019 actual results(1) and reflects a 20-25% discount to pre COVID-19 pricing based on comparable publicly-disclosed hotel sales.(2) Hyatt will continue to manage Hyatt Regency Austin under a long-term management agreement. James F. Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are excited to have executed an off-market, opportunistic acquisition of a high-quality hotel in one of the nation’s fastest growing cities, which continues to be a top beneficiary of corporate and people relocation. As travel resumes, we expect the well-located Hyatt Regency Austin to benefit from a strong rebound led by Austin’s multiple leisure and business demand drivers that are anchored in world-renowned music festivals, sporting events and blue-chip corporations. Additionally, we are encouraged by the reported contraction in Austin’s hotel construction pipeline relative to pre-pandemic levels and by the market’s significantly lower hotel operating costs compared to other markets. We expect this acquisition to raise our EBITDA growth profile, while positively enhancing our geographic diversification by adding a market with a thriving economy and a young and vibrant population.” Risoleo continued, “Our long-standing relationships and ability to execute quickly and with existing liquidity, provided us the opportunity to acquire this hotel ahead of a planned foreclosure auction at a very attractive yield based on 2019 performance. Our goal is for the Hyatt Regency Austin to exceed 2019 levels of revenues and EBITDA on a stabilized basis as Hyatt leverages Host’s data-driven asset management and enterprise analytics platforms to drive incremental expense reductions and productivity improvements at the hotel.” Situated on nearly six acres in a park-like setting along Lady Bird Lake, this waterfront hotel commands scenic views and is near the vibrant South Congress District with easy access to numerous leisure attractions, including the South Congress entertainment area, Zilker Park, and the Colorado River which offers recreational water activities. The 670,000 square-foot property had a rooms renovation in 2015 and a meeting space expansion in 2015 and renovation in 2018. The hotel offers 45,000 square feet of total meeting space (including ballrooms of 14,000 and 10,000 square feet), two food and beverage outlets, an outdoor pool, and a fitness center.

James F. Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We continued to grow sequential revenues while minimizing operating expenses in the fourth quarter and further reduced our net loss and hotel-level operating losses from third-quarter levels. With accelerating vaccine deployment, decreasing weekly COVID-19 case counts and the easing of lockdowns, we are encouraged by recent booking activities. In January, we saw year-over-year increases in group bookings for future periods and near-term transient demand is continuing to show signs of improvement. We are optimistic that travel and tourism will continue to pick up as the pandemic recedes and expect our hotel portfolio to return to profitability in the aggregate sometime during the second half of 2021 based on hotel-level EBITDA.” Risoleo continued, “We entered 2021 with $2.5 billion dollars in total available liquidity and remain focused on minimizing cash burn and preserving liquidity while increasing financial flexibility to create long-term value for our stockholders. On this front, we have secured a best-in-class second amendment to our credit agreement that extends our covenant waiver period while further enhancing our ability to opportunistically invest in value-creation opportunities. We also remain focused on our key strategic objectives of redefining our operating model and strategically allocating capital to accelerate our EBITDA recovery and deliver long-term growth for our stockholders.” ________________________ (1)NAREIT Funds From Operations (“FFO”) per diluted share, Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre and all owned hotel results (pro forma) are non-GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). See the Notes to Financial Information on why the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. N/M = Not meaningful HIGHLIGHTS: Results for Fourth Quarter 2020 Recorded a GAAP net loss of $66 million in the fourth quarter 2020 compared to a net loss of $316 million in the third quarter, reflecting a relative improvement in hotel results and a fourth quarter gain on asset sales.Reduced hotel-level operating loss by 23% compared to third quarter 2020 due to a sequential improvement in RevPAR and operations and improved year-over-year RevPAR declines each quarter since the second quarter of 2020.Achieved break-even or positive hotel-level operating profit at 20 of its hotels, representing 24% of rooms, in the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase from 14 hotels, representing 13% of rooms, achieved in the third quarter.Recorded a gain on sale of assets of approximately $195 million in the fourth quarter as a result of completing the previously announced sales of the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa for $216 million and 29 acres of land adjacent to The Phoenician hotel for approximately $66 million.Ended the quarter with total available liquidity of approximately $2.5 billion, including FF&E escrow reserves of $139 million. Progress in 2021 Achieved RevPAR of approximately $42 for January 2021 based on preliminary estimates, with performance driven by Sun Belt markets as well as Washington, D.C.On January 21, 2021, celebrated the opening of the AC Hotel Scottsdale North, a 165-room select-service hotel that was developed by the Company on an underutilized parking lot alongside The Westin Kierland Resort & Spa. The Company now has a total of 80 consolidated hotels, of which 76 hotels, representing 94% of the Company’s room count, are open as of February 18, 2021.On February 9, 2021, the Company amended its credit facility to extend the covenant waiver period through the first quarter of 2022 as well as to further modify the covenant levels required after the waiver period ends and to provide additional flexibility with regard to acquisitions, asset sales, capital expenditures and mandatory prepayment without any changes to the existing pricing grid. Additional details of the terms were provided in a press release published February 10, 2021. OPERATING ACTIVITIES CASH AND CASH BURN Significant components of the Company’s total cash burn are (in millions): Quarter endedDecember 31, 2020 Quarter endedSeptember 30, 2020 Net loss $(66) $(316)GAAP net cash used in operating activities (143) (149)Cash burn from operations (149) (183)Cash burn (2) (264) (267) Components of cash burn: Hotel-level operating loss (2) (75) (97)Interest payments (3) (50) (27)Cash corporate and other expenses (12) (15)Net proceeds from (payments to) unconsolidated operations 9 (1)Severance at hotel properties (21) (43)Cash burn from operations (149) (183)Capital expenditures (115) (84) For the fourth quarter, improvement in RevPAR and operations offset the anticipated increase in cash expenditures for interest and capital expenditures, as well as less Employee Retention Credit (“ERC”) received. Fourth quarter cash burn also benefited from a $10 million distribution received from the Company’s joint venture that owns a timeshare in Hawaii. Until such time as COVID-19 case counts and hospitalizations decline, the Company anticipates that operations will continue to be significantly reduced at its hotel properties. Therefore, while forecasting remains difficult due to the uncertainty surrounding the on-going pandemic and minimal visibility into future results, the Company believes that hotel-level operations in the first quarter of 2021 will be commensurate with the fourth quarter of 2020 and anticipates the portfolio will return to profitability in the aggregate based on hotel-level EBITDA sometime during the second half of the year when vaccines for COVID-19 are expected to become more widely available. The Company estimates in the first quarter of 2021: (i)the average monthly GAAP cash used in operating activities would be approximately $57 million at the midpoint, which includes estimated interest, corporate-level expenses, and cash timing adjustments; (ii)monthly cash burn from operations would be approximately $49 million to $54 million, and total cash burn, which includes estimated monthly capital expenditures, would be $83 million to $93 million(2). ________________________ (2)Hotel-level operating loss and cash burn are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the SEC. See the Notes to Financial Information on why the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures.(3)Interest payments for the fourth and third quarter do not include cash debt extinguishment costs of $8 million and $26 million, respectively, which are considered a financing activity on the Company’s statement of cash flows.

Furloughed employees received healthcare benefits of approximately $27 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $112 million for the full year.During the fourth quarter 2020, approximately $13 million of furlough costs were accrued, to be paid in the first quarter of 2021.In addition, the Company’s hotel operators recorded a $15 million credit related to the ERC in the fourth quarter and $39 million for the full year, that, under the CARES Act, partially offset the costs for the operator’s furloughed hotel employees and reduced hotel-level operating expenses.Furlough costs are expected to continue to decline as a result of the workforce reconfigurations, noted below. The related ERC is also expected to decline. Re-evaluated the workforce structure and implemented changes that are expected to lead to a more efficient operating model in the long term. As a result, the Company recorded severance costs of approximately $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $65 million for the full year, with no further severance currently expected.Reduced full year 2020 corporate expenses by nearly 17% compared to the prior year. _________________________ (4)Represents the hotels that were accepting reservations during the entirety of the month. Excludes the seven, four, and four hotels with suspended operations in the months of October, November and December, respectively. HOTEL BUSINESS MIX UPDATE The Company’s customers fall into three broad groups: transient, group and contract business, which accounted for approximately 61%, 35%, and 4%, respectively, of its 2019 room sales. During the fourth quarter, demand continued to be primarily driven by drive-to and resort destinations. The following are the sequential results of the Company’s consolidated portfolio, including all owned hotels at December 31, 2020, for transient, group and contract business: Quarter ended December 31, 2020 Quarter ended September 30, 2020 Transient Group Contract Transient Group Contract Room nights (in thousands) 585 156 83 523 127 74 Percentage change in room nights vs. same period in 2019 (70.1)% (86.0)% (47.1)% (75.4)% (88.7)% (57.7)%Room Revenues (in millions) $126 $24 $12 $96 $17 $11 Percentage change in revenues vs. same period in 2019 (74.9)% (91.0)% (63.6)% (81.1)% (93.0)% (68.7)% CAPITAL EXPENDITURES The following presents the Company’s 2020 capital expenditures spend and forecast for 2021 (in millions): Year ended December 31, 2020 2021 Full Year Forecast Actuals Low-end of range High-end of range ROI - Marriott transformational capital program $175 $110 $140 ROI - All other ROI projects 168 165 185 Total ROI project spend 343 275 325 Renewals and Replacements 156 100 150 Total Capital Expenditures $499 $375 $475 In 2020, the Company prioritized major capital projects in assets and markets that are expected to recover faster, such as leisure and drive-to destinations, as well as previously announced major return on investment projects and continued completion of the Marriott transformational capital program to take advantage of reduced demand. The Company is utilizing the low occupancy environment to accelerate certain projects and minimize future disruption. The Company believes the renovations will position these hotels to capture additional revenue during the economic recovery. Major projects completed in 2020 include: Marriott transformational capital program completions at the Minneapolis Marriott City Center, San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter, and JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead;Resort renovations at the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa and The Don Cesar in St. Pete Beach; andNew hotel construction completion of the AC Hotel Scottsdale North. Planned 2021 projects include: Marriott transformational capital program completions at The Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island, New York Marriott Marquis, Houston Marriott Medical Center, and Orlando World Center Marriott;Value enhancing investments including completion of the luxury villa expansion at Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and a new waterpark at The Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort, Naples;Commencement of a tower expansion and extensive guestroom renovation at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples; andResort renovations at the Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa. The Company received approximately $19 million in operating profit guarantees in 2020, under the Marriott transformational capital program, including $6 million that was received in the fourth quarter, and expects to receive approximately $16 million in 2021. The Company has established key milestones to review major projects prior to implementation with the ability to reduce 2021 capital expenditures by approximately $150 million if required to conserve cash. BALANCE SHEET The Company maintains a robust balance sheet with the following balances at December 31, 2020: Total assets of $12.9 billion.Cash balance of approximately $2.3 billion and FF&E escrow reserves of $139 million.Debt balance of $5.5 billion, with an average maturity of 5.0 years, an average interest rate of 3.0%, and no maturities until 2023. During the fourth quarter, the Company redeemed the remaining $86 million of outstanding 4.75% Series C Senior Notes due 2023 for $94 million, including $8 million of prepayment costs, which was its last senior notes issued before attaining an investment grade rating. On February 9, 2021, the Company amended its credit facility for the second time during the pandemic to further extend the covenant waiver period through the first quarter of 2022. Financial covenant testing will resume for the second quarter of 2022, based on annualized results for the quarter, but only a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0x will be required for the second quarter of 2022. For subsequent quarters, all financial covenants will be tested, with leverage ratio tested at the modified levels agreed to in the second amendment. The second amendment also provided additional flexibility for $500 million in asset sales without a prepayment requirement provided that the net proceeds are used to acquire hotel properties unencumbered by debt. This, along with the previous ability to acquire up to $1.5 billion of acquisitions funded with existing liquidity, brings the total acquisition capacity up to $2 billion. The amendment also retained the ability to acquire up to $7.5 billion of acquisitions funded with equity. The credit facility amendments generally require that net proceeds from debt issuances and asset sales in excess of $350 million (which has been fully utilized), and subject to certain exceptions, be used to repay borrowings under the revolver and term loans. As a result of these requirements, a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of Series I senior notes, the Newport Beach Marriott sale and the land sale at The Phoenician were used to repay $12 million of the revolving credit facility during the fourth quarter. At December 31, 2020, the Company was below the financial covenant levels under its senior notes indentures necessary to incur debt and, as a result, it will not be able to redraw this amount under the credit facility or incur additional debt while below these levels. Quarterly dividends and stock repurchases also remain suspended to help preserve liquidity and are restricted under the terms of the credit facility amendments. 2021 OUTLOOK Given the global economic uncertainty COVID-19 has created for the travel, airline, lodging and tourism and event industries, among others, the Company cannot provide guidance for its operations or fully estimate the effect of COVID-19 on operations. The Company believes that recovery within the lodging industry is highly dependent on the strength of the economy, consumer confidence and, especially with respect to corporate and group travel, the timing of vaccine deployment. The Company does not expect to see a material improvement in operations until government restrictions have been lifted, and business and leisure travelers are comfortable that the risks associated with traveling and contracting COVID-19 are significantly reduced. Based on current expectations for widespread vaccine rollout, this is not expected to occur until the second half of 2021. While the Company is not providing guidance on operations at this time, it estimates that for full year 2021, the following expenses will be in the following range (in millions): Full Year 2021 Low-end ofrange High-end ofrange Interest expense $172 $183 Corporate and other expenses 98 100 The Company does not intend to provide further guidance updates unless deemed appropriate.

However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on operations there is little comparability between periods. For this reason, we are revising our presentation to instead present hotel operating results for all consolidated hotels and, to facilitate comparisons between periods, we are presenting results on a pro forma basis including the following adjustments: (1) operating results are presented for all consolidated properties owned as of December 31, 2020 but do not include the results of operations for properties sold in 2019 or through the reporting date; and (2) operating results for acquisitions in the current and prior year are reflected for full calendar years, to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. See the Notes to Financial Information – All Owned Hotel Operating Statistics and Results for further information on these pro forma statistics and – Constant US$ and Nominal US$ for a discussion on constant US$ presentation. Nominal US$ results include the effect of currency fluctuations, consistent with our financial statement presentation. CBD of a location refers to the central business district.(2)Hotel RevPAR is calculated as room revenues divided by the available room nights. Hotel Total RevPAR is calculated by dividing the sum of rooms, food and beverage and other revenues by the available room nights. HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC.

GAAP profit margins are calculated using amounts presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Hotel margins are calculated using amounts presented in the above tables.(3)Effective for the third quarter of 2020, we have changed our definition of Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted FFO and removed amounts from hotel property level operating results to exclude non-ordinary course severance costs, which we believe provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. Including these severance costs, our All Owned Hotel Pro Forma EBITDA would have been $(83) million for the fourth quarter 2020 and $(202) million for full year 2020.(4)Pro forma adjustments represent the following items: (i) the elimination of results of operations of our sold hotels, which operations are included in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations as continuing operations and (ii) the addition of results for periods prior to our ownership for hotels acquired during the presented periods. For this presentation, we no longer adjust for certain items such as the results of our leased office buildings and other non-hotel revenue and expense items, and they are included in the All Owned Hotel Pro Forma results.

HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC.Notes to Financial Information ALL OWNED HOTEL OPERATING STATISTICS AND RESULTS To facilitate a quarter-to-quarter comparison of our operations, we typically present certain operating statistics (i.e., Total RevPAR, RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses, hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in this presentation on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance (discussed in “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics” below). However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on operations, there is little comparability between periods. For this reason, we temporarily are suspending our comparable hotel presentation and instead present hotel operating results for all consolidated hotels and, to facilitate comparisons between periods, we are presenting results on a pro forma basis, including the following adjustments: (1) operating results are presented for all consolidated hotels owned as of December 31, 2020, but do not include the results of operations for properties sold in 2019 or through the reporting date; and (2) operating results for acquisitions in the current and prior year are reflected for full calendar years, to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. CONSTANT US$ and NOMINAL US$ Operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction, or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. For comparative purposes, we also present the RevPAR results for the prior year assuming the results of our foreign operations were translated using the same exchange rates that were effective for the comparable periods in the current year, thereby eliminating the effect of currency fluctuation for the year-over-year comparisons. We believe this presentation is useful to investors as it provides clarity with respect to growth in RevPAR in the local currency of the hotel consistent with the way we would evaluate our domestic portfolio. However, the effect of changes in foreign currency has been reflected in the results of net income (loss), EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAre, diluted earnings (loss) per common share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share. Nominal US$ results include the effect of currency fluctuations, consistent with our financial statement presentation. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Included in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted), (ii) EBITDA, (iii) EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre, (iv) All Owned Hotel Property Level Operating Results (v) Hotel-level operating loss and (vi) Cash burn. The following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance. NAREIT FFO AND NAREIT FFO PER DILUTED SHARE We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period, as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period, in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted NAREIT’s definition of FFO included in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis. We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, amortization, impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs, even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement, the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons, NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance. Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance, in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share, when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT, provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share: Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt, including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.Severance Expense – Effective beginning the third quarter of 2020, in certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include, but are not limited to, (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business. In unusual circumstances, we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example, in 2017, as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and to increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our on-going operating performance and, therefore, we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO. EBITDA Earnings before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and, like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs. EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre We present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines, as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate,” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the Company’s results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control), impairment expense of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates. We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre: Property Insurance Gains – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition, property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.Severance Expense – Effective beginning the third quarter of 2020, in certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include, but are not limited to, (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business. In unusual circumstances, we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last such adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim. Limitations on the Use of NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share, Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share, EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre We calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs, they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre, which are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures), interest expense (for EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only), severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been, and will be, made and are not reflected in the EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows (“Statements of Cash Flows”) in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, NAREIT FFO per diluted share, Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure, and should not be used as a measure of, amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit. Similarly, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in seven domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 10 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners, we do not control and, therefore, do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by outside partners, and a 15% interest held by outside partners in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and, therefore, consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre were calculated as set forth in the definitions above. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities. Hotel Property Level Operating Results We present certain operating results for our hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses, food and beverage profit, and EBITDA (and the related margins), on a hotel-level pro forma basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our hotel results reflect the operating results of our hotels as discussed in “All Owned Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present all owned hotel pro forma EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our hotels after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our hotels. All owned hotel pro forma results are presented both by location and for the Company’s properties in the aggregate. While severance expense is not uncommon at the individual property level in the normal course of business, we eliminate from our hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business, as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because, even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses, these non-cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier, because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient. Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses, gains or losses on disposition, certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense, the hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses, operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance. While management believes that presentation of all owned hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on all owned hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons, we believe all owned hotel operating results, when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful information to investors and management. COVID-19 Non-GAAP Reporting Measures Hotel-level Operating Loss. We present hotel-level operating loss because management believes this metric is helpful to investors to evaluate the monthly operating performance of our properties during the COVID-19 pandemic. We further adjust All Owned Hotel Pro Forma EBITDA to reflect the benefits for furloughed employees in the month that they are provided to the employees at our hotels, replacing the related GAAP expense accrual. While furlough costs may arise in various situations, the furlough costs incurred during the COVID-19 pandemic are unusually large and not reflective of how wages and benefits are generally accrued and paid. Therefore management adjusts All Owned Hotel Pro Forma EBITDA to include the furlough costs based on the timing that they are provided to the employees of our operators to better reflect monthly costs and evaluate the hotel performance. We accrue for the anticipated furlough costs when our hotel managers have committed to the continuation of these benefits regardless of the timing of the benefits. For example, in March 2020 we accrued $35 million for April and May benefits for furloughed employees at our Marriott- and Hyatt-managed hotels. In June 2020, we accrued $32 million for the July, August and September benefits for our Marriott-managed hotels. As a result, our GAAP operating results reflect the timing of the commitment rather than the actual month of the benefits. Hotel-level operating loss is not intended to be, and should not be used as, a substitute for GAAP net income (loss). Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses, gains or losses on disposition and depreciation and amortization expense, the hotel-level monthly operating results we present do not represent our total operating results and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance. The following presents the reconciliation of the differences between our non-GAAP financial measure, hotel-level operating loss, and net loss, the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that we consider most directly comparable: Quarter endedDecember 31, 2020 Quarter endedSeptember 30, 2020 Net loss $(66) $(316)Depreciation and amortization 167 166 Interest expense 51 66 Benefit for income taxes (64) (73)Gain on sale of property and corporate level income/expense (171) 23 Severance at hotel properties 21 43 All Owned Hotel Pro Forma EBITDA (62) (91)Benefits for furloughed employees adjustment (13) (6)Hotel-level operating loss $(75) $(97) Cash Burn. Management utilizes the cash burn metric to evaluate the amounts necessary to fund operating losses during periods where hotels have suspended operations or are operating at very low levels of occupancy due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, management believes this metric is helpful to investors to evaluate the Company's ongoing ability to continue to fund operating losses during the current periods of operating losses. The Company defines cash burn as cash burn from operations, which is net cash from operating activities adjusted for (i) changes in short term assets and liabilities and (ii) contributions to equity investments, plus capital expenditures, as further described below. Cash burn is not intended to be, and should not be used as a substitute for GAAP cash flow as it does not reflect the issuance or repurchase of equity, the payment of dividends, the issuance or repayment of debt, or other investing activities such as the purchase or sale of hotels. Adjustments include: Changes in short term assets and liabilities – The Company eliminates changes in short-term assets and liabilities, including due from managers, other assets and other liabilities, that primarily represent timing of cash inflows and outflows. As a result, cash burn includes income and expenses in better alignment with how these items are reflected on the statements of operations. These items generally represent receipts and payments that will be settled within the year and do not reflect the cash savings or liquidity needs of the Company on an on-going basis.Contributions to equity investments – The Company includes contributions to equity investments that have been necessary due to the depressed operations for these investments during the COVID-19 pandemic. These contributions are included as investing activities on the Statements of Cash Flows.Capital Expenditures – Capital expenditures are included in the cash burn amount as they represent a significant on-going cash outflow of the Company. While management continually evaluates its capital expenditures program to appropriately balance improving and renewing its hotel portfolio with its overall cash needs; management continues to anticipate capital expenditures to be a significant cash outflow. The following presents the reconciliation of our net cash used in operating activities from our Statements of Cash Flows to cash burn (in millions): Quarter endedDecember 31, 2020 Quarter endedSeptember 30, 2020 GAAP net cash used in operating activities $(143) $(149) Contributions to equity investments (1) (1)Timing adjustments Change in due from/to managers 21 (82)Change in other assets (21) 37 Change in other liabilities (5) 12 Cash burn from operations (149) (183)Capital expenditures (115) (84)Cash burn $(264) $(267) In a scenario in which hotel operational performance is commensurate with the fourth quarter of 2020, the following presents the reconciliation of monthly cash used in operating activities to cash burn (in millions): Monthly average Low High GAAP net cash used in operating activities $(59) $(54) Timing adjustments Changes in other assets/other liabilities 5 5 Cash burn from operations (54) (49)Capital expenditures (39) (34)Cash burn $(93) $(83) SOURAV GHOSH Chief Financial Officer (240) 744-5267TEJAL ENGMANInvestor Relations(240) 744-5116ir@hosthotels.com A PDF accompanying this announcement is available at: http://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/efdf052e-392a-4496-aa20-1c3a18510f74",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b0b1bf5a0e08cc43e275b7926fe570772cdc3b118f67d8c1d05a947313173e06
