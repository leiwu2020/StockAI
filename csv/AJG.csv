Gallagher & Co. (AJG) has acquired LDJ American Online Benefits Group (AOBG). Acquisition terms were not disclosed. AOBG has a network of 2,500 agents across the U.S. The company provides supplemental health insurance and wellness products. AJG Chairman, President, and CEO J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr., said, “AOBG’s specialized expertise and product offerings serve the needs of individuals who typically don’t have access to employer group benefits, such as self-employed, retired, and gig-economy workers. Their offerings complement and expand our strengths in the affinity market.” (See Arthur J. Gallagher stock analysis on TipRanks) Post-acquisition, AOBG will function under the guidance of Gallagher’s head of North American Affinity operations, Kevin Garvin. On May 21, Merrill Lynch analyst Joshua Shanker initiated coverage of AJG with a Sell rating and a price target of $133, implying a 9.3% downside potential. Shanker believes that AJG is in a good position in the insurance industry amid M&A activity and is on the path to be “truly global”. Nevertheless, the analyst views the market as having already incorporated these factors in AJG’s current valuation. Consensus among analysts is that AJG is a Moderate Buy based on 5 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $154 implies 5% upside potential. Shares have gained about 55.2% over the past year.

Gallagher & Co. (AJG) has acquired LDJ American Online Benefits Group (AOBG). Acquisition terms were not disclosed.



AOBG has a network of 2,500 agents across the U.S. The company provides supplemental health insurance and wellness products.



AJG Chairman, President, and CEO J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr., said, “AOBG’s specialized expertise and product offerings serve the needs of individuals who typically don’t have access to employer group benefits, such as self-employed, retired, and gig-economy workers. Their offerings complement and expand our strengths in the affinity market.” (See Arthur J. Gallagher stock analysis on TipRanks)



Post-acquisition, AOBG will function under the guidance of Gallagher’s head of North American Affinity operations, Kevin Garvin.



On May 21, Merrill Lynch analyst Joshua Shanker initiated coverage of AJG with a Sell rating and a price target of $133,  implying a 9.3% downside potential.



Shanker believes that AJG is in a good position in the insurance industry amid M&A activity and is on the path to be ""truly global"". Nevertheless, the analyst views the market as having already incorporated these factors in AJG’s current valuation.



Consensus among analysts is that AJG is a Moderate Buy based on 5 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $154 implies 5% upside potential. Shares have gained about 55.2% over the past year.

Post-acquisition, it will continue to function with current management under the guidance of Gallagher’s Peter Doyle and John Tournet. AJG’s Chairman, President, and CEO J.

company,1614785526,Analyzing Arthur J. Gallagher's Ex-Dividend Date,66253638,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,AJG,Yahoo,"On January 27, 2021, Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG) announced shareholders can expect to receive a dividend payable on March 19, 2021. The stock will then go ex-dividend 1 business day(s) before the record date. Arthur J. Gallagher, which has a current dividend per share of $0.48, has an ex-dividend date scheduled for March 4, 2021. That equates to a dividend yield of 1.64% at current price levels. The Significance Of An Ex-Dividend Date An ex-dividend date is when a company's shares stop trading with its current dividend payout in preparation for the company to announce a new one. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Most ex-dividend dates operate on a quarterly basis. Arthur J. Gallagher's Dividend History Over the past year, Arthur J. Gallagher has seen its dividend payouts climb upward and its yields trend downward. Last year on March 5, 2020 the company's payout sat at $0.45, which has since increased by $0.03. Arthur J. Gallagher's dividend yield last year was 1.83%, which has since decreased by 0.19%. Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market. To read more news on Arthur J. Gallagher click here.
