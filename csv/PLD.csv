(PLD) reported stronger-than-expected Q2 results driven by strong demand for logistics space and all-time low vacancies.  Shares of the global industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) have gained 34% over the past year.



The company reported Q2 revenues of $1.15 billion, beating analysts’ expectations of $1.02 billion. (See PLD stock charts on TipRanks)



Meanwhile, earnings per share came in at $0.81, versus $0.54 recorded in the prior-year quarter. The company reported Q2 Funds from Operations (FFO) of 1.01 per share versus FFO of $1.11 per share in the prior-year period.



While total revenues fell from $1.27 billion in the year-ago quarter, rental revenues came in at $1.02 billion, up from $945 million in the prior-year quarter.



Based on robust Q2 results, the company raised its guidance for Fiscal 2021 and now forecasts net earnings in the range of $3.08 - $3.14 per share, compared to the previously guided range of $2.80 - $2.90.



The REIT also forecasts core FFO in the range of $4.04 - $4.08 per share versus previous guidance of $3.96- $4.02 per share.



Prologis CFO Thomas S. Olinger commented, ""Our outlook is equally promising, supported by our in-place-to-market spread of nearly 17 percent; a land portfolio with a build-out potential of about $18 billion; and an industry-leading balance sheet.""



Following the strong Q2 results, Wells Fargo analyst Blaine Heck reiterated a Buy rating on the stock.



Heck favors Prologis over its competitors based on the company’s FFO beat, impressive leasing metrics, and enhanced same-store growth.



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 9 Buys and 1 Hold. The average PLD price target of $135.50 implies 6.9% upside potential from current levels. 



PLD scores a “Perfect 10” from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

Prologis Inc. is a leading industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) that operates and manages industrial real estate space in the Americas, Asia, and Europe. Over the past year, shares of the company have jumped 37.8%, trading at over $126.



A strong set of numbers in Q2 might propel the stock price upward, so let’s take a closer look at what analysts on the Street are expecting.



Q2 Expectations



For Q2, the Street expects PLD to report adjusted EPS of $0.99 and revenues of $1.02 billion.



Meanwhile, the Earnings Whisper number, or the Street’s unofficial view on earnings, stands at $1.02 per share. (See PLD stock charts on TipRanks)



Q1 Snapshot



In Q1, Prologis reported total revenues of $1.15 billion, up from $978.2 million in the year-ago quarter, beating the consensus estimate of $1.01 billion.



Rental revenues came in at $1.02 billion, up from $878.8 million in the prior-year quarter.



Meanwhile, the company reported earnings per share of $0.49, which exceeded analysts’ estimates of $0.41 per share. Core funds from operations (FFO) per share were $0.97 in Q1 versus $0.83 in the year-ago quarter.



Factors to Note



Prologis is one of the world's largest providers of industrial properties and is expected to have benefitted in Q2 from the growing industrial market in the United States. The company's primary concentration is on providing warehouses, which serve as the backbone of global trade.



The industrial market in the United States had a great start to the year, and the trend is expected to continue in the first half of 2021. According to research from Cushman & Wakefield, demand surpassed supply for the second time in a row.



During the second quarter of 2021, there was a net absorption of 110.2 million square feet (msf) of space, up 96.7% from the 56 million square feet reported in the second quarter of 2020.



Warehouse/distribution space, in particular, emerged as the most popular secondary property type. New lease activity surpassed 100 msf for the 22nd consecutive quarter, totaling 212.5 msf. This reflects the rise in digital sales, which fueled e-commerce leasing and third-party logistics, and aided warehouses and distribution centers. After the first half of 2021, the new supply was 140.6 million square feet, down 14.2 percent from the 164 million square feet reported the year before.



Furthermore, rent growth was underpinned by continued tight market conditions and strong demand in the second quarter, which grew 6.8% year over year.



Amid these encouraging figures, Prologis is well-positioned to benefit from its capacity to offer modern logistics facilities at strategic in-fill locations. The REIT is expected to have seen robust demand as a result of the rapid adoption of e-commerce, with lease activity picking up in the quarter to be reported.



Apart from these, the company’s expansion efforts, through acquisitions and developments in recent years, are likely to have boosted the top line during the soon-to-be-reported quarter.



With Prologis witnessing robust demand for high-quality logistics real estate in key locations across the globe, the company is also anticipated to have continued its investment activities in the second quarter of 2021. In addition, the company's industry-leading cost structure is anticipated to help the company expand profits in the upcoming quarter.



Furthermore, Prologis has decent balance-sheet strength to aid its growth endeavors. Being a market leader, the REIT has the ability to raise capital at favorable rates and is likely to have maintained financial strength with liquidity during the period in discussion.



Prologis CEO Hamid R. Moghadam said in Q1, ""With our well-positioned portfolio, differentiated customer offerings, and abundant investment capacity, we expect to continue to outperform while delivering exceptional customer service.” Those are vital points that investors could be looking at this quarter.



Positive Analyst Recommendations 



Ahead of the Q2 earnings release, Raymond James analyst William Crow reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $138.00 from $125.00. This implies 8.7% upside potential to current levels.



Crow remains bullish on the industrial REIT sector as a whole. The analyst commented, “As the sector leader, we believe Prologis is well-positioned to capture ongoing growth driven by these robust sector fundamentals and the e-commerce/logistics boom.”



He further added, “Prologis continues to navigate the favorable backdrop to deliver industry leasing SSNOI growth, robust leasing spreads, solid rent growth and unmatched scale provides a competitive advantage.”



On July 15, another analyst, Vikram Malhorta of Morgan Stanley also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $131.00 from $120.00. This implies 3.2% upside potential to current levels.



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 9 Buys and 1 Hold. The average PLD price target of $135.70 implies 6.9% upside potential from the current levels.



PLD scores a 7 of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock is likely to perform in line with market averages.
