(the “Company” or “O’Reilly”) (Nasdaq: ORLY), a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry, today announced record revenue and earnings for its first quarter ended March 31, 2021. 1st Quarter Financial Results Greg Johnson, O’Reilly’s CEO and Co-President, commented, “We are extremely proud to report our exceptionally strong start to 2021, highlighted by comparable store sales growth of 24.8%, which represents the strongest quarterly comparable store sales growth in our Company’s history, and a 78% increase in diluted earnings per share. Team O’Reilly once again delivered record-breaking results in the midst of continued challenges presented by the pandemic and extreme weather across much of the country, and I am extremely grateful for our over 77,000 Team Members and their relentless focus on consistently providing excellent service to our customers no matter the obstacles they face. Our top priority remains the safety and wellness of our Team Members and our customers, and I sincerely appreciate the unrelenting efforts of our Team to execute on our safety protocols, while still providing great service and generating incredible operating results.” Sales for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021, increased $614 million, or 25%, to $3.09 billion from $2.48 billion for the same period one year ago. Gross profit for the first quarter increased 27% to $1.64 billion (or 53.1% of sales) from $1.30 billion (or 52.3% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased 9% to $950 million (or 30.7% of sales) from $872 million (or 35.2% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Operating income for the first quarter increased 63% to $691 million (or 22.4% of sales) from $424 million (or 17.1% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Net income for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021, increased $201 million, or 67%, to $502 million (or 16.2% of sales) from $300 million (or 12.1% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Diluted earnings per common share for the first quarter increased 78% to $7.06 on 71 million shares versus $3.97 on 76 million shares for the same period one year ago. Mr. Johnson continued, “Our record-breaking top-line performance, coupled with our ongoing focus on profitable growth, drove a 63% increase in operating profit dollars for the first quarter and generated a 526 basis point increase in operating margin to 22.4%. Our sales growth for the quarter was comprised of continued, broad-based strength across our DIY and professional business and was supported by favorable winter and spring weather, as well as a significant benefit from the latest rounds of government stimulus. Based on the strength of our first quarter results, our robust performance to date in April and, most importantly, our confidence in Team O’Reilly’s ability to continue to provide industry-leading customer service, we are raising our full-year comparable store sales guidance to a range of positive 1% to 3% from our previous range of down 2% to flat. We also are increasing our full-year diluted earnings per share guidance to a range of $24.75 to $24.95, which represents an increase of $2.05 at the midpoint from our previously provided guidance. I would once again like to thank all of Team O’Reilly for your hard work and commitment to our success – your tireless efforts continue to drive our record-breaking results.” 1st Quarter Comparable Store Sales Results Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales for U.S. stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members, as well as sales from Leap Day for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Online sales, resulting from ship-to-home orders and pick-up-in-store orders, for U.S. stores open at least one year, are included in the comparable store sales calculation. Comparable store sales increased 24.8% for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021, versus a decrease of 1.9% for the same period one year ago. Share Repurchase Program During the first quarter ended March 31, 2021, the Company repurchased 1.5 million shares of its common stock, at an average price per share of $450.65, for a total investment of $665 million. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter and through the date of this release, the Company did not repurchase any additional shares of its common stock. The Company has repurchased a total of 82.5 million shares of its common stock under its share repurchase program since the inception of the program in January of 2011 and through the date of this release, at an average price of $181.02, for a total aggregate investment of $14.93 billion. As of the date of this release, the Company had approximately $817 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization. Updated Full-Year 2021 Guidance The Company still anticipates potentially significant volatility in its results, driven by the ongoing uncertainty related to the pandemic, and will update full-year guidance during 2021, as appropriate, and if needed. The table below outlines the Company’s guidance for selected updated full-year 2021 financial data: For the Year Ending December 31, 2021Comparable store sales 1% to 3%Total revenue $11.8 billion to $12.1 billionGross profit as a percentage of sales 52.2% to 52.7%Operating income as a percentage of sales 19.9% to 20.4%Effective income tax rate 23.0%Diluted earnings per share (1) $24.75 to $24.95Net cash provided by operating activities $1.8 billion to $2.3 billionCapital expenditures $550 million to $650 millionFree cash flow (2) $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion (1)Weighted-average shares outstanding, assuming dilution, used in the denominator of this calculation, includes share repurchases made by the Company through the date of this release. (2)Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. The table below reconciles Free cash flow guidance to Net cash provided by operating activities guidance, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure: For the Year Ending(in millions) December 31, 2021Net cash provided by operating activities $1,840 to $2,265Less:Capital expenditures 550 to 650 Excess tax benefit from share-based compensation payments 10 to 15 Investment in tax credit equity investments 180 to 200Free cash flow $1,100 to $1,400 Non-GAAP Information This release contains certain financial information not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These items include adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation and rent (“EBITDAR”) and free cash flow. The Company does not, nor does it suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. The Company believes that the presentation of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and free cash flow provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company’s core operations. The Company has included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measure in the table above and the selected financial information below.

Our Board’s relentless focus on self-evaluation, transparency and succession planning, for both the Board and our Executive Management Team, ensures our Board continually evolves to meet the needs of our shareholders. Our focus on continual improvement has resulted in a Board that is now more gender and ethnically diverse, has driven refreshment through the successful nomination and shareholder approval of four new and highly qualified Board members with a broad range of knowledge and skills over the last three years, has compelled fresh perspectives by rotating Board committee Chairpersons and has created enhanced shareholder disclosures and reporting with the issuance of our second annual Sustainability, Social and Governance Report. In addition, our Board’s focus on succession planning ensures the Company is prepared well in advance of critical leadership changes. As a direct result of these ongoing efforts, we are very pleased to announce the appointment of Greg Henslee to the position of Executive Chairman subject to his reelection to the Board at our Annual Meeting in May. Greg has worked in the automotive aftermarket industry his entire career, accumulating a wealth of knowledge and experience, and David has done an exceptional job preparing Greg and planning for this succession. We are confident Greg is both qualified and prepared to transition into this new leadership role for the Board and the Company.” Mr. Burchfield continued, “David has expressed his strong desire to continue to remain highly involved in the operations of the Company and to serve on the Board, and we are very happy to announce the appointment of David to the position of Executive Vice Chairman, subject to his reelection to the Board at our Annual Meeting in May. In this role, David will continue to provide the Board and the Executive Management Team with the benefit of his knowledge and industry experience and will be a trusted advisor to Greg as he assumes his new role. Our Board remains committed to excellent corporate governance, diversity and inclusion, and we will continue to adapt to meet the needs of the Company and our shareholders in the future.” David O’Reilly commented, “I am very grateful to have served as O’Reilly’s Executive Chairman and am excited to continue to be a part of our future success as Executive Vice Chairman. I am also thrilled that Greg Henslee is well prepared and ready to succeed me as Executive Chairman. Greg is very well respected for his expertise throughout the automotive aftermarket industry, has been an excellent executive for our Company for many years and has brought valuable skills and perspective to the Board since joining in 2017. I am confident that Greg’s knowledge and experience make him the most qualified person to be the Executive Chairman and help lead our Company to success going forward.” “It is an honor to be re-nominated to serve on O’Reilly’s Board and an even greater honor to transition into the role of Executive Chairman, and I am excited to take on this new challenge,” stated Greg Henslee. “David has been an amazing mentor to me since I began working for O’Reilly, and I am very pleased that he will continue to serve on the Company’s Board as Executive Vice Chairman. Since our founding, O’Reilly has operated using a committee-driven approach at every level of the Company, ensuring we arrive at the best possible decisions by always considering diverse opinions. Through this same process, O’Reilly has developed an extremely well rounded and qualified Board, where each member’s skills complement one another, and I am confident that our Board is well positioned to build upon our Company’s history of long-term success.” Mr. Henslee possesses over 37 years of experience in the automotive aftermarket industry. He began his O’Reilly career in 1984 as a Parts Specialist in an O’Reilly store and progressed through the roles of Assistant Store Manager, District Manager, Computer Operations Manager, Director of Computer Operations and Loss Prevention, Vice President of Store Operations, Senior Vice President of Information Systems, Inventory Control, Customer Service, Computer Operations, Pricing and Loss Prevention, Co-President, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Co-President, and CEO and President.

Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased 13% to $6.09 billion (or 52.4% of sales) from $5.39 billion (or 53.1% of sales) for the same period one year ago. SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased 6% to $3.67 billion (or 31.6% of sales) from $3.47 billion (or 34.2% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased 26% to $2.42 billion (or 20.8% of sales) from $1.92 billion (or 18.9% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased $361 million, or 26%, to $1.75 billion (or 15.1% of sales) from $1.39 billion (or 13.7% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased 32% to $23.53 on 74 million shares versus $17.88 on 78 million shares for the same period one year ago. “As we look forward to 2021,” Mr. Johnson continued, “we remain optimistic about our prospects to generate continued strong financial results. We have seen a strong start to the year, with the continuation of robust sales volumes through the month of January, but we remain cautious as we plan for the coming year in light of the continued significant uncertainty related to the ongoing impact of the pandemic and the difficult comparisons we will face beginning in April, as we lap the surge of volume we experienced in 2020. As a result, our expectation is that comparable store sales will be in the range of down 2% to flat, versus 2020, but well above our historical trends on a two-year stack basis.” 4th Quarter and Full-Year Comparable Store Sales ResultsComparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales for U.S. stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members, as well as sales from Leap Day for the year ended December 31, 2020. Online sales, resulting from ship-to-home orders and pick-up-in-store orders, for U.S. stores open at least one year, are included in the comparable store sales calculation. Comparable store sales increased 11.2% for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020, on top of 4.4% for the same period one year ago. Comparable store sales increased 10.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020, on top of 4.0% for the same period one year ago. Share Repurchase ProgramDuring the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased 2.2 million shares of its common stock, at an average price per share of $451.90, for a total investment of $993 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased 4.8 million shares of its common stock, at an average price per share of $431.93, for a total investment of $2.09 billion. Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter and through the date of this release, the Company repurchased an additional 0.7 million shares of its common stock, at an average price per share of $447.40, for a total investment of $298 million. The Company has repurchased a total of 81.7 million shares of its common stock under its share repurchase program since the inception of the program in January of 2011 and through the date of this release, at an average price of $178.33, for a total aggregate investment of $14.57 billion. Today, the Company also announced that its Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under its share repurchase program by an additional $1.0 billion, raising the aggregate authorization under the program to $15.75 billion. The additional $1.0 billion authorization is effective for a three-year period, beginning on February 10, 2021. Stock repurchases under the program may be made from time to time, as the Company deems appropriate, solely through open market repurchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate requirements and overall market conditions. There can be no assurance as to the number of shares the Company will purchase, if any. The share repurchase program may be increased or otherwise modified, renewed, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, without prior notice. As of the date of this release, the Company had approximately $1.18 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorizations. Full-Year 2021 GuidanceThe Company is reinstituting its practice of providing selected full-year guidance for 2021. The Company still anticipates potentially significant volatility in its results, driven by the ongoing uncertainty related to the pandemic, and will update full-year guidance during 2021, as appropriate. The table below outlines the Company’s guidance for selected full-year 2021 financial data: For the Year Ending December 31, 2021Net, new store openings 165 to 175Comparable store sales -2% to 0%Total revenue $11.5 billion to $11.8 billionGross profit as a percentage of sales 52.2% to 52.7%Operating income as a percentage of sales 19.0% to 19.5%Effective income tax rate 23.0%Diluted earnings per share (1) $22.70 to $22.90Net cash provided by operating activities $1.7 billion to $2.2 billionCapital expenditures $550 million to $650 millionFree cash flow (2) $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion (1) Weighted-average shares outstanding, assuming dilution, used in the denominator of this calculation, includes share repurchases made by the Company through the date of this release. (2) Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. The table below reconciles Free cash flow guidance to Net cash provided by operating activities guidance, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure: For the Year Ending(in millions) December 31, 2021Net cash provided by operating activities $1,735 to $2,160 Less:Capital expenditures 550 to 650 Excess tax benefit from share-based compensation payments 5 to 10 Investment in tax credit equity investments 180 to 200Free cash flow $1,000 to $1,300 Non-GAAP InformationThis release contains certain financial information not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These items include adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation and rent (“EBITDAR”) and free cash flow. The Company does not, nor does it suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. The Company believes that the presentation of adjusted debt to EBITDAR and free cash flow provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company’s core operations. The Company has included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measure in the table above and the selected financial information below.
