(AON) has received conditional approval from the European Union (EU) antitrust regulators for its $30 billion bid to acquire Willis Towers Watson, according to a report by Reuters.



The conditional approval requires Aon to divest key parts of Willis’ business to rival Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (AJG). 



Aon offers a suite of financial risk-mitigation products, which include health insurance plans, pension administration and insurance. The U.K.-based Willis Towers Watson provides advisory, insurance brokerage and risk management services.



The EU competition enforcer said, “The commitments will strengthen Gallagher in its capabilities in reinsurance and commercial risk brokerage and improve its footprint in the European Economic Area.”



On June 16, The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) filed a lawsuit to stop Aon from acquiring Willis and said the acquisition would reduce competition and lead to higher prices. (See Aon stock chart on TipRanks)



William Blair analyst Adam Klauber recently reiterated a Buy rating on Aon but did not assign a price target. In a research note to investors, the analyst said, ""The DoJ’s lawsuit could result in near-term uncertainty for Aon, but in-line valuation and good near-term prospects should limit downside.""



Overall, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 3 Buys, 3 Holds and 1 Sell. The average Aon price target of $261.80 implies 10.8% upside potential. The company’s shares have gained 20% over the past year.



According to TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, Aon scores an 8 out of 10. This suggests that the stock is likely to outperform market averages.

The insurance broker has agreed to sell its U.S. retirement and retiree health exchange units for $1.4 billion in the latest move.

Aon’s U.S. retirement business includes retirement consulting and pension administration operations. It will sell the unit to private equity firm Aquiline, which has $6.4 billion in assets under management and invests in businesses across financial services, technology, business services, and healthcare.

Aon’s retiree health exchange unit serves employers and their retirees and was the first retiree exchange to meet the National Council on Aging (NCOA) standard. Aon will sell the unit to Alight, a technology firm whose clients include 70% of the Fortune 100 companies. 

Aon decided to sell these businesses to address antitrust concerns that U.S. regulators raised over its proposed merger with Willis. 

“Aon and Willis Towers Watson continue to work toward obtaining regulatory approval in all relevant jurisdictions,” Aon said in a statement.

Previously, Aon announced the divestiture of its retirement and investment business in Germany, and Willis agreed to sell its Willis Re unit. (See Willis Towers Watson stock analysis on TipRanks)

Aon and Willis are counting on their merger to drive revenue growth and boost profitability. They are expecting $800 million in cost synergies, including the divestiture of earmarked assets. (See AON PLC stock analysis on TipRanks)

Wells Fargo analyst Elyse Greenspan recently reiterated a Buy rating on Aon stock and raised the price target to $287 from $275. The analyst’s new price target suggests 14.11% upside potential. 

In reaffirming the bullish rating, Greenspan noted Aon’s strong first-quarter results, optimistic organic outlook, and the confirmation of $800 million in cost savings in the Willis deal.

Consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 2 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $261.80 implies 4.09% upside potential to current levels.

AON scores a 9 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

Shares of the global professional service company rallied as investors reacted to a 10% increase in revenue to $3.5 billion.Revenue growth was driven mainly by strong retention and net new business generation. Aon also benefited from a 5% reduction in its operating expenses. Net income attributable to shareholders increased 18% to $913 million, or $4 a share. Cash flow from operations was up 66% to $561 million, as free cash flow increased 91% to $532 million. During the quarter, Aon purchased 0.2 million Class A ordinary shares, valued at $50 million. (See Aon stock analysis on TipRanks)“In the first quarter, our colleagues delivered an outstanding operational performance including 6% organic revenue growth and 170 basis points of margin improvement, building on over a decade of progress on our key financial metrics, creating momentum for 2021, and demonstrating the power of Aon United,"" said CEO Greg Case.Impressed by strong organic growth numbers and earnings, Wells Fargo analyst Elyse Greenspan reiterated a Buy rating. According to the analyst, AON is well-positioned for mid-single-digit or greater revenue growth in 2021.“AON is positioned to show a pick up in organic revenue growth as we move through 2021 and should continue to improve its margins. Overall, we view the WLTW acquisition favorably (expected to close in H1 2021) and believe the company's accretion guidance could prove to be conservative and especially expect them to exceed the $800 million of expense savings for the transaction,” Greenspan wrote in a research note to investors.The analyst has a $287 price target on Aon, implying a 14.14% upside potential to current levels.The consensus among analysts on Wall Street is that AON is a Moderate Buy, based on 3 Buy, 3 Hold and 1 Sell ratings. The average analyst price target of $258.67 implies a 2.88% upside potential to current levels.AON scores a 6 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, suggesting its performance is likely to align with market averages. Related News:Comscore Secures Long-Term Renewal Agreement With BBC World NewsApple Slapped With $12M Fine In Russia Over Anti-Competitive Practices - ReportBaidu To Launch Autonomous Ride-Hailing Services In Beijing",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=cbf0bee92956786408af55f7d1ed0c790a20507475bf93119a0469ad6ed1a3d1
