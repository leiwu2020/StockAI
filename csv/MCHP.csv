Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announced it has extended its FPGA family’s security with the DesignShield development tool that further helps prevent this information from being extracted for malicious purposes. “As a leader in the security space, Microchip offers a portfolio featuring the latest countermeasures for reducing the risk of cloning, intellectual property theft, reverse engineering, or the insertion of malicious Trojan Horses,” said Bruce Weyer, vice president of Microchip’s FPGA business unit. “Protecting CPI in deployed systems with our DesignShield tool is essential for national security and economic vibrancy. The tool advances the state of bitstream protection mechanisms and provides another defensive layer in ensuring that deployed systems behave as intended and are safe from counterfeiters and their threat to a developer’s design investments and brand reputation.” The DesignShield tool was created to protect developers of aerospace, defense and other high-assurance systems from cybercriminals trying to acquire an FPGA’s bitstream from the fielded system. It deters reverse-engineering of the bitstream, which can often include CPI, by obscuring its logical equivalent using a combination of logic and routing-based encryption techniques. This improves design security and integrity while reducing system corruption risks, and reduces the possibility that custom code, intellectual property, or information critical to national security is used by non-authorized agents. AvailabilityThe DesignShield tool is available under license as part of Microchip’s Early Access Program, which enables customers to begin designing with FPGA devices and design tools ahead of broader commercial availability. The DesignShield tool is part of Microchip’s Libero Development Tool Suite. For more information, contact DesignShield@microchip.com. Microchip’s FPGA SecurityBased on non-volatile flash memory, Microchip’s FPGAs offer inherently better security than SRAM-based alternatives that expose sensitive bitstream data on every power cycle. Microchip FPGAs also include unique integrated security features that prevent overbuilding and cloning, protect design IP, and provide a root of trust, secure data communications and anti-tamper capabilities. The company’s layered approach to security includes licensed, patented differential power analysis (DPA) protection, built-in certified security functions, built-in tamper detectors, and supply chain assurance that the FPGA is authentic. Security requires layers and not having a single wall to break through. DesignShield adds another layer that protects the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of a design.

GAAP net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 were a record $1.467 billion, up 10.6% from net sales of $1.326 billion in the prior year's fourth fiscal quarter. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 was $116.0 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, up from GAAP net income of $99.9 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, in the prior year's fourth fiscal quarter. For the fourth quarters of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, GAAP net income was significantly adversely impacted by purchase accounting adjustments associated with our acquisitions. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, GAAP net income was also significantly adversely impacted by a loss on debt settlement. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 was a record at $521.4 million, or $1.85 per diluted share, up from non-GAAP net income of $375.5 million, or $1.46 per diluted share, in the prior year's fourth fiscal quarter. For the fourth quarters of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, COVID-19 shelter-in-place restrictions on manufacturing activities, manufacturing excursion, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, severance and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition), professional services associated with certain legal matters, IT security remediation costs, non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures, losses on the settlement of debt, and gains related to equity investments. For the fourth quarters of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, our non-GAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the applicable fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release. GAAP net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 were a record $5.438 billion, an increase of 3.1% from net sales of $5.274 billion in the prior fiscal year. GAAP net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 was $349.4 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, a decrease of 38.8% from net income of $570.6 million, or $2.23 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year. Fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 GAAP net income were significantly adversely impacted by purchase accounting adjustments associated with our acquisitions. GAAP net income for fiscal 2021 was adversely impacted by the loss on debt settlement associated with our debt refinancing activities. GAAP net income for fiscal 2020 was significantly positively impacted by the tax benefit related to the intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property rights. Non-GAAP net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 was a record $1.78 billion, or $6.59 per diluted share, an increase of 24.0% from net income of $1.44 billion, or $5.62 per diluted share, in the prior fiscal year. See the ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section of this release. Microchip announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a record quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 41.3 cents per share, up 5.9% from the cash dividend paid last quarter. The quarterly dividend is payable on June 4, 2021 to stockholders of record on May 21, 2021. ""Our March quarter results were strong by every key metric, closing out a tumultuous fiscal year on a very positive note, which was otherwise dominated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Ganesh Moorthy, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""March quarter revenue, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS and EBITDA were all records, as every aspect of our business over-performed. Our journey towards our long-term operating model of 65% non-GAAP gross margin and 42% non-GAAP operating margin is off to a good start."" Mr. Moorthy added, ""Business conditions remained exceptionally strong through the March quarter with record bookings and backlog for product to be shipped over multiple quarters. Demand outpaced the capacity improvements we implemented, resulting in lead times continuing to extend out. In my 40 years in the semiconductor industry, I cannot recall a time when the imbalance between supply and demand has been more acute. In response, we launched our Preferred Supply Program (PSP) to provide customers with supply priority beginning 6 months after their order in exchange for at least 12 months of non-cancellable orders. Customer response to the program has exceeded our expectations with direct customers and distributors alike. About 44% of our backlog is now in the PSP category, although it is almost 100% of our backlog in some of the most constrained capacity areas. This gives us a solid foundation to enable us to prudently acquire constrained raw materials, invest in expanding factory capacity, and hire employees to support our factory ramps."" Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chairman, said, ""Microchip's Board of Directors initiated a path to higher dividends in our February 2021 dividend announcement with a sequential increase in our dividend of 5.8%. We are continuing on this path as we announced today that the Board of Directors have approved a sequential increase in our dividend of 5.9%, to 41.3 cents per share, up from 39 cents previously. We expect to continue to increase dividends quarterly as part of our cash return strategy."" Eric Bjornholt, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, said, ""We continued to aggressively pay down our debt with another $369.2 million of payments during the March quarter, reflecting a cumulative debt pay down of $3.61 billion over the past 11 quarters, as we have actively managed the working capital requirements for the business. In the March quarter, we exchanged $359.2 million of our convertible subordinated notes for cash and shares of common stock. While these transactions did not impact the overall level of debt on our balance sheet, we believe that these convertible debt exchanges will benefit stockholders by significantly reducing share count dilution to the extent our stock price appreciates over time. The principal amount of convertible debt on our balance sheet at the end of fiscal year 2021 is $1.263 billion compared to $4.481 billion at the beginning of calendar year 2020, putting our overall capital structure in a much better long-term position."" Mr. Moorthy concluded, ""Our backlog for the June quarter is very strong. In addition, we have considerable backlog requested by customers in the June quarter that currently cannot be fulfilled until later quarters despite us growing capacity from the last quarter. This is because the entire semiconductor supply chain remains constrained. Given this backdrop, we expect our net sales in the June quarter to be up between 3.5% and 7.5% sequentially.""

First Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Outlook: The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. We are not able to predict whether inventory at our distributors will increase or decrease during the quarter and are therefore providing a range of GAAP net sales guidance. In recent years, we have seen net inventory at our distributors increase or decrease by a significant amount in a single quarter.

Therefore, our estimate of GAAP operating expenses excludes certain amounts that may be recognized as Special Charges and Other, net in the quarter ending June 30, 2021.(3) The forecast for GAAP tax expense excludes any unexpected tax events that may occur during the quarter, as these amounts cannot be forecasted.(4) Represents expected cash tax rate for fiscal 2022 excluding any transition tax payments associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Microchip's inventory days in the June 2021 quarter are expected to be in the range of 107 to 112 days, compared to 112 days at March 31, 2021. Our actual inventory level will depend on the inventory that our distributors decide to hold to support their customers, overall demand for our products and our production levels.Capital expenditures for the quarter ending June 30, 2021 are expected to be between $70 million and $90 million. Capital expenditures for all of fiscal 2022 are expected to be between $225 million and $275 million. We continue to add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the growth of our business. Under the GAAP revenue recognition standard which we adopted on April 1, 2018, we are required to recognize revenue when control of the product changes from us to a customer or distributor. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on creating demand for our products in the end markets we serve and not on moving inventory into our distribution network. Therefore, the elements of our internal performance and executive and employee compensation metrics that are based on sales and operating results are measured using the value of the end-market demand for our products. We use end-market demand for these purposes because we do not believe that the underlying value of our business benefits from increases in the value of inventory that is held in the supply chain. As many of our products are designed into customer applications with relatively long lives, such value is only realized when the end-market demand is created and the supply chain sells the inventory to the end customer. We define end-market demand as the net dollar amount of our products, licensing revenue and other services delivered to our direct (non-distributor) customers and by our distributors to their customers. We are able to calculate end-market demand based on information that our distributors provide us about their product shipments to their customers and inventory holdings. The value of end-market demand from our distributors is calculated as the net transaction value of these shipments. We believe that our end-market demand metric reflects true end-market demand based on when product is sold to direct customers or by our distributors to an end customer. We believe the use of end-market demand is also important to investors and users of our financial statements as it reflects the final outcome of our sales activities whereas our GAAP net sales are based on estimates made earlier in (or before the end of) the process of creating and fulfilling demand is complete. We also manage our manufacturing and supply chain operations, including our distributor relationships, towards the goal of having our products available at the time and location the end customer desires. Management uses end-market demand to manage and assess the profitability of our business and when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose end-market demand metric because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it provides better information regarding end-market demand for our products. Therefore, we believe that it is useful to investors for us to disclose end-market demand. Our determination of end-market demand metric might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Our non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include the effect of share-based compensation, COVID-19 shelter-in-place restrictions on manufacturing activities, manufacturing excursion, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, severance and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition), professional services associated with certain legal matters, IT security remediation costs, non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures, losses on the settlement of debt, and gains related to equity investments. For the fourth quarters of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, our non-GAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. Our other non-GAAP adjustments are either non-cash expenses, unusual or infrequent items or other expenses related to transactions. Management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models. We are using non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP other expense, net, and non-GAAP income tax rate, which exclude the items noted above, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of our business and for compensation purposes. We also use our non-GAAP results when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. Our determination of these non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using these non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results. Generally, gross margin fluctuates over time, driven primarily by the mix of products sold and licensing revenue; variances in manufacturing yields; fixed cost absorption; wafer fab loading levels; costs of wafers from foundries; inventory reserves; pricing pressures in our non-proprietary product lines; and competitive and economic conditions. Operating expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to net sales and profit levels. Diluted Common Shares Outstanding can vary for, among other things, the trading price of our common stock, the exercise of options or vesting of restricted stock units, the potential for incremental dilutive shares from our convertible debentures (additional information regarding our share count is available in the investor relations section of our website under the heading ""Supplemental Financial Information""), and repurchases or issuances of shares of our common stock. The diluted common shares outstanding presented in the guidance table above assumes an average Microchip stock price in the June 2021 quarter between $155 and $165 per share (however, we make no prediction as to what our actual share price will be for such period or any other period and we cannot estimate what our stock option exercise activity will be during the quarter).

The dividend is payable on June 4, 2021 to stockholders of record on May 21, 2021. Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003 and has increased its dividend 67 times since its inception. “Microchip’s financial performance in the March 2021 quarter was very strong driving significant cash generation and debt reduction,” said Steve Sanghi, Executive Chairman. “The Microchip Board of Directors initiated a path to higher dividends in our February 2021 dividend announcement as part of our cash return strategy. Our Board is pleased to declare a 5.9% increase in our quarterly dividend to a record 41.3 cents per share, which continues to reflect confidence in the cash-generating capability of our business, as well as our ongoing commitment to returning value to our stockholders.” Cautionary Statement: The statements contained in this release relating to our path to higher dividends, our cash return strategy, confidence in the cash-generating capability of our business, and our ongoing commitment to returning value to our stockholders are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

To enable system designers better integration and higher performance while reducing development costs and time to market, COTS technologies and scalable solutions are increasingly used in space applications. Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announced the qualification of its SAMRH71 Arm-based microprocessor (MPU) and the availability of the SAMRH707 microcontroller (MCU), both implementing Arm Cortex-M7 SoC radiation-hardened technology. “Spacecraft and satellites are expanding in complexity to provide commercial and military operators with robust new communication and data capabilities, greater reliability and faster speeds, while the operators continuously seek to reduce cost, size and weight,” said Bob Vampola, associate vice president of Microchip’s aerospace and defense business unit. “In this environment, lowering system development costs while enabling greater capabilities and space system integration are ever more critical.” Microchip’s SAMRH71 and SAMRH707 devices were developed with the support of the European Space Agency (ESA) and Centre National D’Etudes Spatiales (CNES), the French space agency, to further research and program initiatives. “The introduction of Arm technologies for space applications opens up new perspectives by enabling the use of the same ecosystem well in place in the consumer and industrial sectors,” said David Dangla, VLSI Components Expert at CNES. “The SAMRH71 is the first Arm Cortex M7-based rad-hard microprocessor available today on the market. It offers developers the simplicity of a single-core processor and the performance of an advanced architecture without having to implement heavy mitigation techniques as is required for non-space components.” “Integration of digital-to-analog converters and analog-to-digital converters together with a powerful processor core is a key requirement for addressing new challenges in aerospace applications,” said Kostas Marinis, Onboard Computers Engineer at ESA. “With the SAMRH707, Microchip provides easy-to-use capabilities in cost-effective, radiation-hardened MCUs.” Relying on the standard Arm Cortex-M7 architecture and the same peripherals as automotive and industrial processors, the SAMRH71 and SAMRH707 provide system development cost and schedule optimization by leveraging standard software and hardware tools from the consumer devices. The SAMRH71, a radiation-hardened variant of Microchip’s COTS automotive SoC technology, provides a combination of space connectivity interfaces along with high-performance architecture with more than 200 Dhrystone MIPS (DMIPS). Designed for high-level radiation performance, extreme temperatures and high reliability, the SAMRH71’s Arm Cortex-M7 core is coupled with high-bandwidth communication interfaces such as SpaceWire, MIL-STD-1553, CAN FD and Ethernet with IEEE 1588 Generalized Precision Time Protocol (gPTP) capabilities. The device is fully ESCC qualified with support from CNES and compliant with MIL standard Class V and Q high-reliability grades, allowing systems to meet strict compliance requirements. Extending the portfolio of Microchip’s radiation-hardened Arm Cortex-M7-based MCUs, the SAMRH707 device provides analog functions on top of a >100 DMIPS processor unit with Digital Signal Processing (DSP) capabilities, combined with space connectivity interfaces in a small footprint designed for high-level radiation performance, extreme temperatures and high reliability. The SAMRH707 enables a high level of integration embedding Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) and flash memory, high-bandwidth communication interfaces including SpaceWire, MIL-STD-1553 and CAN FD, along with analog functions such as a 12-bit Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC). With space-designed MCUs, MPUs and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Microchip provides critical elements for the development of new systems. Microchip’s total system solutions span space-qualified, radiation-hardened and radiation-tolerant power, timing and clock devices, as well as connectivity and memory solutions. Development ToolsTo speed system design, developers can use the SAMRH71F20-EK and SAMRH707F18-EK evaluation boards. Microchip’s full ecosystem supports its SAMRH707 and SAMRH71 space processors and includes MPLAB® Harmony tools suite and third-party software services for space applications. Both Microchip devices are supported by the company’s Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing, debugging and software libraries. The devices are supported in MPLAB Harmony version 3.0. AvailabilityThe SAMRH71 ceramic package device is available in volume production quantities with QMLQ (SAMRH71F20C-7GB-MQ) and QMLV (SAMRH71F20C-7GB-SV) equivalent qualification levels. For applications requiring high volumes and cost-optimized structures, the SAMRH71 is available for printed circuit board design or evaluation in Ball Grid Array (BGA) plastic packaging.

With Microchip Technology Inc.’s (Nasdaq: MCHP) new Power Delivery Software Framework (PSF), designers can now modify and own the IP in their USB-C PD systems. By merging their proprietary code with Microchip’s fully functionable PD stack, designers have the ultimate flexibility for creating differentiated product offerings while choosing from a wide variety of Microchip SmartHubs, microcontrollers (MCUs) and standalone PD solutions for their USB systems. Microchip’s PSF solution offers both an open-source code base for power delivery and a comprehensive programming environment, removing the need for manufacturer dependence and making it easy for users to program MCUs and immediately modify PD code as their system evolves. Harnessing the benefits of this industry-changing solution, customers can now determine their own product destiny, reducing time to market and overall bill of materials (BOM). Leveraging both a software and hardware framework, developers can also choose from an expanded family of Microchip controller options to host PD functionality, including the new UPD301B and UPD301C standalone PD controllers. The PD architecture’s open approach enables customers to easily add a USB-C/PD port to a wide range of embedded applications, while also allowing customers to reallocate unused pins or CPU memory to other system functions. A range of Microchip SAM and PIC® MCUs and dsPIC® Digital Signal Controllers (DSCs) are supported. The PSF solution gives designers the option to run PD on an existing Microchip MCU infrastructure by adding the UPD350 PD transceiver or by integrating PD into more complex product offerings with proprietary system code. “With our new PD Software Framework, all Microchip MCUs and standalone controllers that support USB-C now share the same PD code base,” said Charles Forni, vice president of Microchip’s USB and networking business unit. “This code is provided free to customers and is easy to configure and modify, enabling our customers to implement new features and system updates without the need for a manufacturer to customize the code for them. Microchip’s PSF offering changes the way USB-C PD is integrated into customer systems.” Development Tools The PSF software solution is supported by Microchip’s MPLAB® X IDE development environment. The PSF evaluation board features the SAMD20 MCU and the UPD350 PD PHY and is available today. Pricing and Availability Microchip’s open-source Power Delivery Software framework (PSF) is available for download on Microchip’s website at no cost. The UPD301C is available for $1.50 in 10,000-unit quantities. For additional information, contact a Microchip sales representative, authorized worldwide distributor or visit Microchip’s website.

The Semiconductor Analyst: Nikolay Todorov upgraded the ratings for Microchip Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MCHP) and Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ: TXN) from Neutral to Buy, while establishing price targets of $186 and $220, respectively. The Semiconductor Thesis: The semiconductor cycle seems to be in the “middle innings” and the gap between demand and supply is unlikely to close in 2021, Todorov said in the upgrade note. Referring to Microchip Technology, the analyst said there is “earnings upside from incremental GM and op leverage, and multiple re-rating to in-line with peer avg. (from 10% discount today) driven by balance sheet deleveraging and scaling of shareholder return initially via rapidly growing dividend and later by market buybacks.” Regarding Texas Instruments, Todorov wrote, “We think the combination of higher product availability, and now more direct-to-customer sales (63% of 4Q sales were direct vs less than 40% a year ago), will make TI more nimble and allow it to pick incremental share near term.” MCHP Price Action: Shares are down 2.00 % to $151.77 at time of publication Tuesday. TXN Price Action: Shares are down 0.19% to $179.75 at time of publication Tuesday.

Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announced its TimeProvider® 4100 Release 2.2 grandmaster, providing a new level of resiliency with the introduction of an innovative redundancy architecture in addition to support for a multiband Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver and enhanced security to ensure always-on precise timing and synchronization. Redundancy is key for infrastructure providers to ensure uninterrupted services. Infrastructure deployments previously relied on hardware redundancy to avoid service disruption despite costly modular architectures. Microchip’s TimeProvider 4100 Release 2.2 grandmaster provides redundancy via software implementation, enabling flexible deployment and lower hardware costs without sacrificing ports. In addition, the TimeProvider 4100 Release 2.2 grandmaster introduces an increased level of resiliency by supporting a new GNSS multi-band, multi-constellation receiver to protect against time delay resulting from space weather, solar events and other disruptions that may impact critical infrastructure services. Multiband GNSS is particularly important for the highest levels of accuracy including Primary Reference Time Clock Class B (PRTC-B) (40 ns) and Enhanced Primary Reference Time Clock (ePRTC) (30 ns). With a focus on security solutions across its technology portfolio, Microchip’s new TimeProvider 4100 Release 2.2 grandmaster adds support for RADIUS and TACACS+ as well as new anti-jamming and anti-spoofing capabilities. “Resilient, redundant and secure precise timing and synchronization solutions are necessary to mitigate security risks to critical infrastructure,” said Randy Brudzinski, vice president and general manager of Microchip's frequency and time business unit. “This latest release brings an innovative software redundancy that enables always-on technology as well as support for multiband GNSS to eliminate ionospheric time error delays. It provides new key security, anti-jamming and anti-spoofing so critical infrastructure services can be accessed only by authorized, authenticated personnel.” In addition, the TimeProvider 4100 Release 2.2 grandmaster provides a super Oven Controlled Crystal Oscillator (OCXO) option for enhanced holdover capabilities in case of GNSS disruption. The TimeProvider 4100 Release 2.2 grandmaster is a family of products with hardware expansion modules for legacy fan-out or Ethernet fan-out with 10 Gigabit Ethernet support. It can be configured in specific operation modes to act either as a gateway clock, a high-performance boundary clock or an ePRTC. The TimeProvider 4100 Release 2.2 grandmaster embeds additional Microchip technology including its OCXO, super OCXO, Rubidium atomic clock, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Ethernet switch, synthesizers and cleaning oscillators. The TimeProvider 4100 is part of Microchip’s virtual Primary Reference Time Clock (vPRTC) product portfolio, offering end-to-end precise time and synchronization solutions. These include Cesium atomic clocks for source of frequency and time, the BlueSky™ GNSS Firewall for security, TimeProvider 4100 high-performance boundary clock and TimeProvider 4100 Gateway clocks, as well as the TimePictra software suite, which manages the end-to-end precise time architecture across all Microchip timing products. Service and SupportMicrochip’s TimeProvider 4100 Release 2.2 grandmaster offers several options for software and hardware support including installation, sync audits, network engineering and 24/7 worldwide support. Pricing and AvailabilityThe TimeProvider 4100 Release 2.2 grandmaster is available now for both new and already-deployed systems.
