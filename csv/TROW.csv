Rowe Price Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer Bill Stromberg said the firm plans to bring its U.S. workers back to the office by Sept. 13 after more than a year of remote work.The money manager will allow employees in North America to return on a voluntary basis until that date, with social distancing measures in place, Stromberg said in an interview Thursday after the Baltimore-based company posted first-quarter results.“We’re coming back with a commitment to additional workplace flexibility, more than we’ve had in the past,” Stromberg said. “Some jobs really do function better in the office than others, and some can be more independent than others,” he added. “We’re in the process of working that out, job-by-job, right now.”Financial firms are stepping up efforts to bring workers back as Covid-19 vaccines become more broadly available and in-person schooling resumes. Many companies are deciding whether to bring everyone back full time or embrace more flexible schedules that would allow staff to work remotely for part of each week.While some jobs such as trading are more suited for an office setting, technology and programming roles can be better handled remotely, Stromberg said. T. Rowe Price, which oversaw $1.52 trillion at the end of March, will factor that into its decision-making, he said.Read more: Dimon Signals to Wall Street It’s Time to Return to the OfficeJPMorgan Chase & Co. became the first major Wall Street bank to mandate a return to offices in the U.S., with employees expected to show up on a rotating basis by early July.

Rowe Price reported first-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.01 a share, 6 cents better than the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Clients added a net $1.2 billion to the firm’s funds in the period, far short of the $3.4 billion analysts predicted.

Rowe Price Group announced that its preliminary assets under management (AUM) during the month ended March 31 rose 1.3% to $1.52 trillion from the prior month mainly driven by a rise in equity assets. However, shares of the Baltimore-based global investment manager dipped 3.1% to close at $176.93 on April 13. T. Rowe Price’s (TROW) client transfers from mutual funds to other portfolios, including trusts and separate accounts were $1.7 billion in March. March-end total assets in the U.S. mutual funds portfolio came in at $816 billion, almost 1% up from the prior month. Equity assets make up 63% of the portfolio, 27% are multi-assets and the remaining 10% are fixed income and money market assets. Total assets from other investment portfolios were $702 billion, increasing 1.4% from the previous month. Overall, equity and fixed income, including the money market accounted for $496 billion or 71% of other investment portfolios, while multi-assets were $206 billion or 29%. T. Rowe Price recorded $352 billion in target date-retirement portfolios, up 2.3% from the $344 billion reported in February. (See T. Rowe Price stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the release, Citigroup analyst William Katz downgraded the stock to Sell from Hold and maintained a price target of $157 (11.3% downside potential). In a note to investors, Katz said that the “flow story remains disappointing” with “mixed” lead indicators. Furthermore, given the company’s “inability to meaningfully improve” its growth path, the analyst foresees risk to T. Rowe Price’s multiple. Overall, the stock has a Hold consensus rating based on 1 Buy, 3 Holds, and 2 Sells. The average analyst price target of $174.33 implies 1.5% downside potential from current levels. Shares have increased 19.8% so far this year.

Rowe Price Group Inc. and Temasek Holdings Pte for its planned merger with a blank-check company, people with knowledge of the matter said.The firms have expressed interest in joining a private investment in public equity offering, or PIPE, to support Grab’s combination with Altimeter Growth Corp., the people said, asking not to be identified because the talks are private. BlackRock Inc. is also in talks to participate in the PIPE, which could raise about $4 billion, according to the people.Singapore-based Grab aims to announce the SPAC merger as soon as next week, the people said. The deal could value Grab at more than $34 billion, the people said.The Grab deal could become the biggest SPAC merger ever, according to data complied by Bloomberg, and would see the startup become one of the first Southeast Asian unicorns to go public through a blank-check company. Indonesia’s Traveloka is in advanced talks to list via Bridgetown Holdings Ltd., a SPAC backed by billionaires Peter Thiel and Richard Li, Bloomberg News has reported.The terms being discussed would give Grab an enterprise value equivalent to roughly 8.5 times its revenue, the people said. Details of the transaction are still being finalized, and the investor lineup could change, the people said.Representatives for Grab, T. Rowe Price and Temasek declined to comment. A spokesperson for BlackRock couldn’t immediately comment, while a representative for Altimeter didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.Grab, backed by SoftBank Group Corp., increased net revenue by about 70% in 2020 after bouncing back from a Covid-19 trough. The startup was last valued at about $16 billion, a person with knowledge of the matter said. It’s now angling to delve deeper into online finance and food delivery.Altimeter Growth Corp., sponsored by Silicon Valley investment firm Altimeter Capital, raised $500 million in its September initial public offering.
