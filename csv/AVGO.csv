Broadcom was in talks to pay between $15 billion and $20 billion to acquire SAS, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal on Monday, July 12.



The deal would have expanded Broadcom’s software business, which contributed 27% of total revenues in Broadcom’s last reported quarter. The semiconductor manufacturer had earlier strengthened its foothold in the software space with the acquisitions of CA Technologies and Symantec’s enterprise security business. (See Broadcom stock chart on TipRanks)



Recently, Broadcom was indicted by the Federal Trade Commission for monopolizing the semiconductor chips used for television and broadband internet services. Following this news, Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $580, implying a 19.8% upside potential to current levels. However, despite expecting the settlement with the FTC to have no material impact on Broadcom’s financials, he offered a cautious outlook for the company.



Pitzer said, “We see significant consolidation, slowing supply growth and performance hungry workloads especially around AI shifting the balance of ASP power towards Semis,"" referring to Broadcom's business model.



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 17 Buys and 2 Holds. The average Broadcom price target of $543.71 implies 11% upside potential to current levels.



Furthermore, TipRanks’ Stock Investors tool shows that investors who hold portfolios on TipRanks currently have a Very Positive stance on Broadcom, with 3.9% of investors increasing their exposure to AVGO stock over the past 30 days.

Citing people familiar with the matter, The Wall Street Journal reports that the deal is valued between $15 billion and $20 billion and could close in the coming weeks.



The acquisition of SAS will accord Broadcom access to crucial analytics business intelligence and data management software that SAS currently sells. According to The Wall Street Journal, Broadcom is increasingly investing in enterprise software offerings as it looks to appeal to more business customers and compete with the likes of Microsoft (MSFT). (See Broadcom stock charts on TipRanks)



A push to acquire SAS Institute does not come as a surprise as Broadcom has grown to become a semiconductor powerhouse on the back of a string of acquisitions. In 2018, it struck a $19 billion deal for CA Technologies, followed by the acquisition of the enterprise software division of Symantec Corp., now known as NortonLifeLock (NLOK), for about $10.7 billion the following year.



The latest acquisition push comes after Broadcom failed to acquire Qualcomm (QCOM). The deal fell through after former President Donald Trump blocked it, citing security risks.



Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer recently affirmed a Buy rating on the stock with a $580 price target, implying 19.40% upside potential to current levels. However, the analyst remains cautious about the company following a nearly no-cost settlement with the FTC.



“We see significant consolidation, slowing supply growth and performance hungry workloads especially around AI shifting the balance of ASP power towards Semis,” said Pitzer.



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 17 Buys and 2 Holds. The average Broadcom price target of $543.71 implies 11.93% upside potential to current levels.



AVGO scores a “Perfect 10” on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

company,1625819344,3 “Strong Buy” Semiconductor Stocks Poised to Surge Higher,68770261,https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?766454363,AVGO,Nasdaq,"Semiconductors are an essential part of our daily lives. From our smartphones to personal computers to our cars and other electronic devices – these tiny silicon chips are everywhere. Over the past year, demand for semiconductors ballooned, and chipmakers struggled to satiate the market's appetite. Higher sales of consumer electronics amid the COVID-19 pandemic and their application in cars and modern technologies like 5G, AI (artificial intelligence), and cloud computing can be attributed to the rising demand.



The industry also marked a wave of consolidation. Nvidia announced the acquisition of Arm, while AMD proposed to acquire Xilinx. However, the bigger question is whether these multi-billion dollar deals will be approved. Also, as the economy is slowly getting back on its feet, pure-play foundries are busy fulfilling orders for the automotive industry, DigiTimes reported citing industry sources. 



While demand for semiconductors could remain uneven industry-wise, IDC forecasts 12.5% year-over-year growth in the semiconductor market and expects it to reach $522 billion this year. 



With an increasing focus on digitization and secular industry trends, the outlook for semiconductor stocks looks positive. Using the TipRanks database, we identified three ""Strong Buy"" semiconductor stocks with considerable upside potential. Let's take a look.



Micron (NASDAQ: MU)



Chipmaker Micron has a rich portfolio of memory and storage products that fuel the modern-day digital economy. It recently delivered robust Q3 results, reflecting 36% year-over-year growth in its revenue and a 136% jump in adjusted net income. Shares of Micron have reversed some of their gains but are up about 54% over the past year. (See Micron stock charts on TipRanks)



Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said, ""Micron is in the best position ever to capitalize on the long-term demand trends across the data center, intelligent edge and user devices."" 



Following the quarterly results, Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill maintained a Buy rating with a price target of $130 on the stock. This reflects 12-month upside potential of 68.6% from current levels. Gill expects Micron to gain from the recovery in the memory cycle. He added, ""We expect MU's top and bottom lines to benefit from growth in NAND and DRAM prices, which we expect to occur throughout 2020. Moreover, we view MU as a key beneficiary of strong data center demand and increased DRAM and NAND content in 5G handsets.""



Overall, 22 Wall Street analysts have weighed in on Micron shares in the past three months, giving the stock 17 Buys and 5 Holds for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average Micron price target of $118.79 implies approximately 54.1% upside potential to current levels.







Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO)



Broadcom manufactures a wide range of semiconductors and offers infrastructure software solutions. Strength across its multiple end markets is driving is semiconductor revenue. Meanwhile, Broadcom's CEO Hock Tan sees ""strong demand from service providers and hypercloud"" and expects ""year-over-year growth to sustain"" in Q3. 



Broadcom's consolidated revenue increased 15% during the last reported quarter. Furthermore, its operating profit jumped 25%. Thanks to strong product demand, Broadcom stock has surged nearly 46% over the past year. (See Broadcom stock charts on TipRanks)



Last month, Bank of America Securities analyst Vivek Arya reiterated his Buy rating with a price target of $580 (23.3% upside potential) on the stock and views Broadcom as an ""extremely attractive"" pick for growth and income investors. Furthermore, Broadcom's multiple growth catalysts, compelling valuation, and solid profitability are the main drivers of Arya's bull case.



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 17 Buys and 2 Holds. The average Broadcom price target of $543.71 implies approximately 15.6% upside potential to current levels.







Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT)



Shares of the chip manufacturer Applied Materials have more than doubled in one year, reflecting its strong financial performance on the back of broad-based strength across its semiconductor businesses. In Q2, Applied Materials' net sales jumped 41% year-over-year, while its net income surged 76% versus the prior-year period. (See Applied Materials stock charts on TipRanks).



Its CEO, Gary Dickerson, said, ""We are confident in our ability to outperform our markets as large, secular trends create sustainable demand for semiconductors and our leadership in materials engineering becomes increasingly critical to deliver new chip technologies.""



Following the Q2 numbers, Needham analyst Quinn Bolton maintained a buy rating with a price target of $153 (15.5% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, Bolton said, ""As the wafer fab equipment (WFE) market leader, AMAT is exposed to the secular growth of WFE, and in particular the deposition and etch segments that have outperformed WFE in the last cycle as Moore's Law has slowed down across logic, DRAM and NAND devices."" 



He added, ""compared to its closest peers, AMAT has a balanced mix of business between the logic/foundry and memory end markets, as well as the broadest product portfolio with a #1 or #2 position in multiple billion dollar categories, which should provide growth, stability, and profitability to the company for multiple years into the future.""



Overall, Applied Materials has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 10 reviews that include 8 Buys and 2 Holds. The average Applied Materials price target of $157.50 implies approximately 18.8% upside potential to current levels.

(CRWD) spiked almost 8% to close at $256.61 on June 22, following an upgrade from Stifel Nicolaus. Shares have increased almost 20% this month post its first-quarter results on June 3, compared to an increase of 14.8% over the past six months.  



CrowdStrike provides cloud workload and endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. (See CrowdStrike stock chart on TipRanks)



Beat-and-Raise Q1 FY22 Results



In Q1, the company's results exceeded the Street's estimates with earnings growth of 400% and a revenue increase of 70% compared to the prior year's quarter.  The company also gave upbeat guidance for Q2 and raised its Fiscal 2022 guidance.



For FY22, the company projects total revenue to be in the range of $1,347.0 to $1,365.7 million and earnings in the range of $0.35-$0.41 per share. The analysts’ estimates of revenue and earnings are pegged at $1.32 billion and $0.30 per share, respectively.



Analysts’ View



On June 21, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Brad Reback upgraded the stock to a Buy from a Hold rating and also increased the price target to $300 from $240, which is a 16.9% upside potential from the current levels.



According to Reback, CrowdStrike has yet to achieve its full potential on the customer acquisition front. In Q1, the company’s subscription customers increased 82.4% to reach 11,420 on a year-over-year basis.  



The analyst was noted, “While CrowdStrike’s subscription customer count has nearly tripled over the last eight quarters, we continue to believe that CrowdStrike’s opportunity to source ARR growth from new customer acquisition remains very early days when considering the degree to which legacy endpoint security providers scaled their respective customer counts over time.”



As a measure to gauge CrowdStrike’s ability to scale, the analyst compares the company to its peers; Symantec's customer count exceeded 100,000 at the time of acquisition by Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), while McAfee's current customer count is around 50,000.



CrowdStrike’s shares have exploded 146.1% over the past year, but the stock still scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 16 Buys and 1 Hold. That’s alongside an average analyst CrowdStrike price target of $257.47, implying that the shares are almost fully valued at current levels.

Using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, let us compare two semiconductor companies, Marvell Technology, and Broadcom, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.







Marvell Technology (MRVL)



Marvell Technology is a fabless semiconductor solutions provider of data infrastructure products that focuses on automotive, data center, carrier and enterprise markets. The company’s products are divided into two broad product categories: networking and storage.



Marvell’s networking products include custom Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), ethernet solutions and processors. Its storage products include fibre channel products and data storage controller solutions.



Last week, Marvell announced Q1 FY22 results with net revenues of $832 million, approximately up 20% year-over-year, while net loss in Q1 narrowed to $88.2 million from a loss of $113 million in the same quarter last year.



The company reported non-GAAP diluted earnings of $0.29 per share versus non-GAAP diluted earnings of $0.18 per share in the same quarter last year. 



The company’s results for Q1 FY22 include the results of Inphi from the acquisition date. MRVL had announced the acquisition of Inphi in October last year in a cash and stock deal valued at $10 billion.



Following the results, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann reiterated a Buy and raised the price target from $60 to $70 on the stock. Mosesmann said in a research note to investors, “In what we have coined the Mother-of-All-Cycles, Marvell is, in a sense, the spear point in AI/ML [artificial intelligence/machine learning] data center, 5G infrastructure, and Automotive markets...""



In Q1, the company saw rise in revenues across all its key product lines, with growth in 5G revenues for the seventh straight consecutive quarter. The increase in 5G revenues was driven by “standard and semi-custom product shipments to Samsung and Nokia, partially offset by a decline in ASICs as deployments in China paused.”



Marvell expects its enterprise networking business to continue doing well as the market for its Ethernet switches and multi-gigabit physical transceivers continues to expand.  For the second quarter, MRVL expects networking revenue to grow 70% year-over-year, driven by Inphi’s complete electro-optics product portfolio.



Marvell’s CFO Jean Hu spoke about the outlook for the second half of the year for the networking business at the earnings call, “As we look forward, we expect a strong second-half ramp compared to the first half in stand-alone Marvell's networking business, including an acceleration in our 5G business from both our own product ramps and an increase in 5G adoption in the U.S. and other regions. From the acquired Inphi business, we expect approximately $215 million in revenue in our second fiscal quarter.""



The company also expects the Inphi acquisition to drive strong growth in the data center and carrier market. According to Marvell, Inphi is the largest provider of Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) 4 Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) that provides high-speed connectivity inside data centers.



When it comes to data storage solutions, MRVL anticipates revenues to rise in “mid-teens” year-over-year in Q2, driven by the nearline hard disk drives (HDD) and data center solid state disk (SSD) markets.



Within the data center market, Marvell perceives the cloud data center to be “significantly bigger” than its 5G opportunity and has forecast it growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% to around $5 billion by 2023. It expects this opportunity to be driven by the rising adoption of ARM processors and custom ASICs. (See Marvell Technology stock analysis on TipRanks)



Mosesmann summed up the valuation of the company, “We see Marvell on the cusp of mega cycles that will last for years in data center/cloud and 5G infrastructure with a portfolio of products/IP and capabilities that we think approaches Broadcom’s infrastructure/data center capabilities.”



He continued, ""Given the growth prospects for Marvell in the double digits for years to come, we believe P/E multiple expansion is in order.”



Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 18 Buys and 3 Holds. The MRVL average analyst price target of $60.61 implies approximately 16.3% upside potential to current levels.







Broadcom (AVGO)



Broadcom is a designer, supplier and developer of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The company’s semiconductor solutions consist of complex digital and mixed-signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor-based devices, while the infrastructure software segment includes the company’s BizOps and cybersecurity solutions, mainframe and fiber channel storage area networking solutions.



Broadcom reported revenues of $6,610 million in the fiscal second quarter, up 15% year-over-year with GAAP diluted earnings of $3.30 per share, a rise of 82% year-over-year.



In the fiscal third quarter, AVGO expects revenues to come in at $6.75 billion while adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to be around 60% of projected revenue.



Following the earnings, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated a Buy and raised the price target from $490 to $520 on the stock. Rakesh said in a note to investors, “We continue to see AVGO well positioned, with leadership in growing markets driven by secular trends 5G and data center, high margins, and strong FCF [free cash flow].”



In Q2, the company’s broadband revenues went up 28% year-over-year and made up 18% of its total semiconductor revenues of $4.8 billion. In the third quarter, AVGO expects to sustain revenue growth in double-digits for the broadband segment as rising adoption of 5G is leading to upgrades in fiber, cable and Internet connectivity.



Broadcom’s networking revenues went up 10% year-over-year and comprised 32% of its semiconductor revenues. While AVGO observed that demand from enterprises has not yet recovered, it expects this demand to pick up in the second half of the year.



Broadcom expects wireless revenues to increase at 30% year-over-year while its product resales are anticipated to increase in a double-digit percentage year-over-year. 



Revenues from its wireless products comprised 34% of the company’s semiconductor revenues in Q2. (See Broadcom Inc stock analysis on TipRanks)



AVGO’s infrastructure solutions business made up 27% of the company’s total revenues in fiscal Q2. In the second quarter, more than 90% of its software bookings were recurring subscription and maintenance booking with an average contract span of three years. Rakesh noted that as a result, the analyst expects that AVGO will continue its focus on core accounts.



The analyst added, “Longer-term, AVGO noted it expects its Software segment to grow mid-single digits %, though we believe the company sees upside in F21E.”



Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 16 Buys and 2 Holds. The AVGO average analyst price target of $541.44 implies approximately 15% upside potential to current levels.







Bottom Line



Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann summed up the difference between the two companies, saying, “The reason that Marvell’s situation is so much stronger than larger peer Broadcom’s (leadtimes are extended but stabilizing) is because Broadcom is not a share gainer per se, they are a content gainer in sockets they have owned for many cycles.”



“Marvell has embraced strategically the custom ASIC, ARM, and 5nm/3nm transition uniquely in the world, which gives the company a capability that may only be matched by Broadcom (if they had the extensive ARM capability/roadmap of Marvell),” Mosesmann added. 



Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, MRVL seems to be a better Buy compared to AVGO.

Christopher Rolland of Susquehanna Financial Group published a report detailing these recent successes. After reviewing Broadcom, Rolland reiterated a Buy rating on the stock, and determined a price target of $540. This price target reflects a 13.68% upside from the Friday June 4th closing price.  



Regarding the Broadcom earnings call, Rolland described the tone as “upbeat,” and was quick to note that Networking and Broadband trends have contributed significantly to the strong quarter. He also highlighted that the CEO was optimistic on the booking trends, “despite a flattening in the company's lead-times,” and does not foresee capacity related issues ahead due to over-booking.  



Rolland quoted the earnings call transcript, which said that the work-from-home trends have been forcing “somewhat of a renaissance” in broadband revenues. Also from the call, the Broadcom management indicated increased investments in Silicon Photonics and other sensitive hardware material.  



Christopher Rolland was positive in general about the stock, boldly stating, “Broadcom remains one of the best large-cap franchises in the industry.” 



On TipRanks, AVGO has an Analyst Consensus Rating of Strong Buy, based on 16 Buy and 2 Hold ratings. Additionally, the AVGO average analyst price target is $540.81.

(NASDAQ: AVGO) today announced immediate availability of its Emulex Gen 7 LPe36000-series Host Bus Adapters (HBAs)— the world’s first 64G Fibre Channel HBA. With the release of LPe36000-series, Broadcom becomes the first in the industry to provide a complete portfolio of products that enable an end-to-end 64G data path. “With the introduction of the Emulex LPe36000-series, Broadcom is now shipping all the technology needed to build out a complete Gen 7 64G network, optimizing mission-critical application performance using Emulex Fibre Channel HBAs for server and storage arrays, Brocade Fibre Channel switches, and Broadcom optics,” said Jeff Hoogenboom, vice president and general manager, Emulex Connectivity Division, Broadcom. “Broadcom end-to-end 64G SAN technology is fueling storage innovation that will drive the industry for the next decade,” said Jack Rondoni, senior vice president and general manager, Brocade Storage Networking division, Broadcom. “Solutions with Brocade switches and Emulex adapters set a new standard for application performance and management simplicity with 64G speed and autonomous SAN technology.” “Broadcom is proud to deliver the industry’s first 64G optic, cementing our place as the innovation leader in performance and reliability-centric optical interconnects,” said Alexis Bjorlin, senior vice president and general manager, Optical Systems Division, Broadcom. “By providing 64G connectivity for Brocade switches and Emulex HBAs, we are able to power the world’s highest-performing storage networks.” Dramatically improving the performance of most SAN-based applications during testing, Emulex LPe36000-series 64G HBAs achieved the following results: Reduced Oracle data warehousing runtime by 87 percent compared to 32G1PCIe 4.0 demonstrated up to a 63 percent improvement in application performance for dual-port 64G HBAs compared to running in a PCIe 3.0 server1Cuts storage migration times by up to 38 percent2Reduces VM Boot storm times by up to half2 “The combination of new PCIe 4.0 servers and all-flash arrays demonstrate such high performance margins that they are now capable of consuming all the bandwidth that current storage networks can deliver,” said Kevin Tolly, Founder, The Tolly Group, “The results of performance testing by Tolly Group demonstrate why all-flash storage arrays should be paired with 64G technology such as Emulex Gen 7 HBAs and Brocade Gen 7 switching.” Emulex Performance Leadership Emulex HBA’s industry-leading performance is made possible due to a record-shattering 10 million IOPS1, which is over 2x higher than previous generation and over 5x higher than the competition. Combined with the industry’s lowest latency HBA response time of 10 microseconds (µs), Emulex provides the performance required to fully utilize the latest PCIe 4.0 bus bandwidth which is double that of PCIe 3.0. The Emulex LPe36000-series ships standard with NVMe over Fibre Channel (NVMe/FC) drivers providing the highest performance SAN connectivity and concurrent protocol support, empowering datacenters to easily transition to NVMe/FC without a fork-lift upgrade. “We are seeing that data center customers continue to choose Fibre Channel to power their mission-critical, highly-secure applications,” said Seamus Crehan, president, Crehan Research Inc. “The Fibre Channel market remains strong, spearheaded by NVMe over Fibre Channel, coupled with growing flash-based storage array deployments. We believe the market will adopt higher-performance 64G Fibre Channel to further increase customer’s ROI on all-flash array purchases.” Introducing the New Emulex SAN Manager Version 1.2 Also announced today, the new Emulex SAN Manager Version 1.2, which extends Broadcom’s autonomous SAN technology to server and storage end-points. Emulex SAN Manager provides single pane-of-glass visibility into every host on the SAN, maximizing uptime by identifying degrading optics on end-points and pinpointing multi-pathing errors and mismatched firmware and driver pairings. Application performance is improved with automatic identification and mitigation of network congestion. Emulex LPe36000-series HBAs, Brocade X7 Directors and G720 Switches, and Broadcom 64G Optical Transceivers are now available. About BroadcomBroadcom Inc.
