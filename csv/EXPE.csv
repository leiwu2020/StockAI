Unfortunately, the deal has not been so great. Note that the shares have gone from a high of $57 to $43. The market capitalization is roughly $7 billion.



Yet it is not uncommon for spin-offs to get hit with plenty of selling. The valuation can be tough to gauge on these offerings. Furthermore, the shareholder base of the parent company may not necessarily want to hold shares in the newly public company.



Now, IAC is certainly no stranger to spin-offs. The company is actually one of the most prolific dealmakers in Corporate America. IAC has engineered 11 spin-offs, such as for Expedia (EXPE), Match Group (MTCH) and LendingTree (TREE). As for Vimeo, this is definitely one to keep an eye on. (See Vimeo stock chart on TipRanks)



Background



Vimeo got its start back in late 2004 (the company’s name is a blend of “video” and “me”). The founders included two programmers, Jake Lodwick and Zach Klein. They had created several other websites, including CollegeHumor, that were part of an organization called Connected Ventures.



A couple years later, IAC acquired the company. Interestingly enough, the main driver for the acquisition was CollegeHumor. But ultimately, Vimeo wound up being the real gem.



Fast forward to today: the company is a powerhouse in the online video industry. Consider that Vimeo has over 200 million users.



The app makes it much easier for anyone to create and distribute professional quality videos. Just some of the features include a sophisticated editing system, stock footage, screen recordings, and templates.



Growth has definitely been robust. In the latest quarter, revenues spiked by 57% to $89.4 million and the net profit came to $3.3 million, compared to a net loss of $20.3 million in the same period a year ago. The company has about $316 million in the bank.



Vimeo generates revenues based on a freemium model. What’s more, although the users are primarily small and medium size businesses (SMBs), Vimeo has been getting more traction with enterprise customers. That has  helped to boost its top line.



The market opportunity is quite large as well. On a global basis, there are over 300 million SMBs and more than one million enterprises.



According to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, the addressable market is estimated at a whopping $70 billion. Moreover, he is highly positive about Vimeo, saying, “From live event streaming to workforce training, business adoption of video is gaining momentum, and we believe Vimeo’s best-in-class platform can become the leading one-stop-shop enterprise solution.”



Wall Street’s Take



Turning to the analyst community, Vimeo stock has 4 Buys and 1 Hold that have been assigned in the past three months. So, the shares are a Strong Buy. At $53, the average analyst Vimeo price target implies 22% upside potential.







Bottom Line On Vimeo Stock



No doubt, online video is a secular tailwind. This technology is rapidly becoming essential for the success of businesses – and yes, Vimeo has a strong solution.



But the company still has only about 1.6 million subscribers. In other words, there is much room for monetizing the base, which should help provide for solid long-term growth.



Disclosure: Tom Taulli does not have a position in Vimeo stock.

For instance, that trip to Europe you’ve been saving for was cruelly taken away. But with the region reopening, now may be a time to consider travel stocks. Now, I’m going to be completely upfront with you early on: I’m still personally skeptical about the general concept of travel stocks. Yes, people are moving out and about. Further, pent-up demand is a real phenomenon, especially with relatively impatient American consumers. But the problem is that millions are still concerned about the Covid-19 crisis. Nevertheless, if I’m wrong about my cautionary perspective, then travel-related investments could bring surprising profitability. First, if you’re optimistic about a global recovery, you have a series of not insignificant facts on your side. Primarily, Europe wants Americans — at least American tourism dollars. According to a late April 2021 report from the New York Times, the head of the European Commission stated that the European Union will allow vaccinated American tourists to visit. With nearly 118 million of us fully vaccinated, this could be a boon for travel stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Second, tourism represents a major catalyst for the European region. Obviously, you have places like Paris, France that routinely ranks among the most visited cities in the world. But several smaller European countries are heavily dependent on tourism. Because the majority of us were cooped up at home, we’re eager to get out of the house and spend money. This too emboldens the bullish case for travel stocks. Third, you have upticks across the board regarding transportation. In particular, air travel has been moving higher encouragingly since the pandemic lows. Therefore, if you can handle the volatility risk, you may want to consider gambling on these travel stocks. 10 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks for Your Reliability Short List Finally, it might be worth noting that because economic activity came to a standstill for several weeks in the U.S., the personal saving rate shot up to astounding heights. This translates to a lot of money that could be spent on Europe, which in turn may bolster these travel stocks to buy. Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY) Air France-KLM (OTCMKTS:AFLYY) InterContinental Hotels Group (NYSE:IHG) Hilton Hotels (NYSE:HLT) Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) Lindblad Expeditions (NASDAQ:LIND) Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Travel Stocks to Buy: Ryanair (RYAAY) Source: Dmitry Birin/Shutterstock.com When I said above that travel stocks are risky, I meant it. Case in point is Ryanair, the Irish ultra-low cost airliner. Ordinarily, I wouldn’t lead with something like RYAAY stock because it’s traded in the over-the-counter exchange. Usually, if it’s not something OTC-themed, I prefer to lead with a blue chip. You know, something that won’t make you rich but won’t leave you in the gutter. Here’s the crazy thing about Ryanair. It is the safest travel play you can get on this list based on the trading action at time of writing. Against the prior session, RYAAY stock was just a hair under parity. So, 0% is the best it gets, at least as far as this write-up is concerned. Are you sure you want to get involved with travel stocks? If the answer is still yes, Ryanair presents an intriguing case. As an Irish carrier, it has limited upside. At the same time, it has limited exposure to what’s going on with the rest of the world. Should tourism pick back up in the British Isles, RYAAY could receive a conspicuous lift. And you’d figure it would be largely a net lift as Ryanair mostly operates within Europe. Air France-KLM (AFLYY) Source: Shutterstock Prior to including Air France-KLM on this list of travel stocks, I was debating whether to replace it with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). While American carriers leave much to be desired in my view, Delta levies a strong presence in European travel routes. But the problem is that Delta is very exposed to the American individualistic mentality. Frankly, this is probably one of the factors why we took so long to get out of the coronavirus mess. Also, DAL absorbed more than a 3% hit on the day that I wrote this. The far more speculative AFLYY stock — also an OTC name — “only” took a 1% hit. So with fingers crossed, I’m boarding Air France-KLM. Still, let me be clear that this will be a turbulent flight for your portfolio. According to Reuters, Air France-KLM is not seeing evidence of a travel recovery it’s hoping for, with the company posting a wider first-quarter operating loss. Plus, management intends to raise capital, which may put pressure on AFLYY stock. Why bother including it on this list of travel stocks? Like I said, I’m skeptical but I’ve got editorial obligations to fulfill. However, Air France-KLM isn’t hopeless. According to a Pew Research Center report, more Americans plan to get vaccinated — or already have. 7 Great Growth Stocks to Consider for Your Short List If so, they could boost demand for European carriers. Still, it’s a risky idea so please be careful. Travel Stocks to Buy: InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) Source: Cineberg/Shutterstock.com When the coronavirus first rippled throughout the globe, one of the hardest-hit sectors were travel stocks; specifically, those which were tied to the hospitality and lodgings industry suffered an inordinate amount of red ink. It was no surprise, though, given the crackdown on non-essential activities. And relaxing in a resort somewhere is the epitome of non-essential. Since then, InterContinental Hotels Group has made a robust recovery, with IHG stock gaining nearly 76% over the trailing year. On a year-to-date basis, shares are up over 6%, though investors are clearly getting jittery. In the past five days, IHG has declined by nearly 4%. As with other travel stocks, 2020 was a rough one for InterContinental Hotels, which saw a year-over-year revenue decline of 48% to $2.4 billion. Therefore, the company needs to produce for its upcoming earnings report or IHG stock could see some volatility. Nevertheless, if you’re optimistic about a rebound, you may want to hold the course. As Air France-KLM noted on its earnings conference call, increased vaccination could spark bookings on the last minute. In other words, you could incur an opportunity cost if you focus solely on the present bad news. Hilton Hotels (HLT) Source: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com Despite a world-renowned brand, that alone hasn’t saved Hilton Hotels from volatility. To be fair, over the trailing year, HLT stock is up over 90%. And on a YTD basis, HLT presently outperforms InterContinental Hotels with a double-digit return (though barely at 10%). Still, the near-term technical posture is getting shaky. In the trailing month, HLT stock is down 2%. On the day of writing, it absorbed a sizable loss of nearly 3%. Honestly, a quick look at the financials reveals that traders are taking the rational route regarding exposure to Hilton. Last year, the company’s revenue hemorrhaged by over 54% to $4.3 billion. Even more concerning is its earnings report for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. In it, Hilton posted revenue of $874 million, which is down 54% YoY and down nearly 2% sequentially from Q4. But as with IHG above, what could end up saving Hilton Hotels is nominally growing vaccinations. Here, I’m going to get a little bit controversial. According to the University of Southern California, “U.S. adults with higher education are significantly more likely to get a COVID-19 vaccination and to believe in the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness.” 7 Stocks to Start your Robinhood Portfolio With Just $2,000 And who can afford Hilton Hotels? The more affluent consumers, which in turn are more likely to be educated. While travel stocks are risky, you may be able to squeak some profits off names that cater to the rich. Travel Stocks to Buy: Expedia (EXPE) Source: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com Take a breath and hold onto the safety bar. Expedia is one roller coaster ride that you don’t want to fall off from. Should international travel to popular regions like Europe return with gusto, EXPE is one of the travel stocks I would anticipate would do well. But the current technicals and fundamentals are not pleasant. This means you’re taking a huge contrarian bet with EXPE stock. According to a Bloomberg report, Expedia did beat estimates for its quarter ended March 31 thanks to a rebound in overall travel. This makes sense from a pent-up demand angle. Essentially, people across the world had to put everything on hold: vacations, graduations, anniversaries, weddings, what have you. So the sentiment of “revenge retail” runs strong. Nevertheless, the comparisons don’t look great. Particularly, Expedia’s revenue in 2020 suffered a 57% loss to $5.2 billion. Top-line sales haven’t been this low since 2013, which gives many pause. However, I should note that Expedia sales gained sequentially by over 35%, giving hope that travel will boom in earnest. That’s great news. Someone needs to tell it to the market, though, as EXPE stock shed 6% on the May 12 session. If you see something that the rest of us don’t, this could be a huge winner. But this is a gargantuan risk. Lindblad Expeditions (LIND) Source: Shutterstock.com We’re going to step into the realm of the crazies with the last two travel stocks on this list, beginning with Lindblad Expeditions. A specialist in travel experiences that go well beyond the beaten path, Lindblad is the company you seek when you’re tired of yet another trip to the Eiffel Tower. Instead, the company greets you with opportunities to explore the mystical natural treasures of Iceland. Or if you’ve really got the exploration bug and want to go full Admiral Byrd, you can take a trip to Antarctica. But the main issue with LIND stock is that the underlying company has a limited audience, which in turn meant that it was devastated from the pandemic. In 2020, Lindblad generated only $82.4 million in revenue, down a staggering 76%. That’s because in the second through fourth quarters of last year, it only posted $1.12 million. While things are starting to improve sequentially, it’s a rough comparison. In first-quarter 2021, Lindblad rang up less than $2 million in top-line sales. 10 Ideal Dividend Stocks for Your Retirement Basically, unless you’re an extreme speculator, you should stay away from LIND stock. However, it’s possible that because Lindblad caters to the rich and educated (who are likelier to get vaccinated), this could be a surprise upside idea. Travel Stocks to Buy: Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) Source: Vytautas Kielaitis/shutterstock.com I’m going to be upfront with you: I have extreme reservations about Norwegian Cruise Line. Then again, this is an article about travel stocks to buy so here we are. Nevertheless, I would not buy NCLH stock unless you can handle severe downside risk. Why the pessimism, you might wonder? Well, aside from the fact that travel stocks related to the cruise ship industry suffered catastrophic losses, this is also the one sector that has been slow to demonstrate any evidence of a recovery. For instance, in 2020, revenue slipped by an almost unbelievable 80% to $1.28 billion. Of course, most of that came from Q1 2020 results. Subsequent quarters have been a disaster, including preliminary data for Q1 2021. Revenue is coming in at $3.1 million, which is simply a disaster. Not surprisingly, long-term debt ballooned to $12.2 billion, which is simply staggering. Again, the one saving grace would be mass-scale vaccinations. Further, those aged 65 years and older in the U.S. are most eager to get vaccinated, with 84% of this demographic getting at least one shot and nearly 72% fully vaccinated. And who are more likely to go on cruises? Old people. On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But the lingering effects of the pandemic could still be seen as the company’s loss ballooned, a result of repayment of debt it took on during the height of the crisis.The San Francisco-based company, which went public in December, reported $10.3 billion in gross bookings in the three months ended March 31, a 52% increase from the year earlier period and well beyond the $7.57 billion analysts’ had predicted. Revenue rose 5% to $887 million, also beating analyst’s projections.“While conditions aren’t yet normal, they are improving, and we expect a travel rebound unlike anything we have seen before,” the company wrote in a letter to shareholders accompanying the results. Airbnb didn’t release an official outlook for the current period, citing ongoing impacts of Covid-19, but said it expects gross bookings to be higher than 2019 levels and that April trends improved from March.“We were not expecting gross booking value to be quite as strong as it was,” Airbnb Chief Executive Officer Brian Chesky said in an interview on Bloomberg Television after the results were published. “We were expecting a strong quarter, but a travel company to actually grow in the midst of a pandemic that certainly was a pretty good scenario for us.”When people in the U.S. older than 60 became eligible for vaccinations earlier this year, Airbnb saw bookings for that age group jump 60%, Chesky said, adding the upcoming travel rebound will be “unlike anything you’ve seen in a century.”Airbnb’s shares fluctuated in extended trading after closing down 3.2% in New York at $135.75.The surprisingly positive results reflect a big upswing from a year ago, when Airbnb’s bookings plunged 80% after the coronavirus shut down most of the world. Travel was one of the hardest hit sectors of the economy in the pandemic, but Airbnb saw a swifter recovery than its peers when urbanites started abandoning their city apartments in favor of longer stays in rural rentals. Domestic leisure travel has continued to increase this year as vaccination rates have climbed in the U.S., with some analysts expecting Airbnb to see bookings return to pre-pandemic levels by summer. “We want to see if we are moving toward post-pandemic normalcy,” Ivan Feinseth, an analyst at Tigress Financial Partners, said in an interview before results were released.Prior to the pandemic, alternative accommodation, or non-hotel type lodgings that Airbnb specializes in, was already the fastest growing segment of the travel market and it’s now leading the rebound. Last week, Booking Holdings Inc. and Expedia Group Inc. reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, buoyed by vacation home-rental demand in the U.S. Both online travel agents said they would be trying to expand their property inventory in the U.S. to take on Airbnb in the peak summer season. Booking’s quarterly revenue declined 50% while Expedia’s was down 44% compared with a year earlier.Airbnb is fighting to retain its top position. In February, the company launched its biggest marketing campaign in five years in a bid to recruit more hosts and said it’s already driving new customers to its platform. Later this month, Airbnb will be unveiling a platform upgrade, which promises to streamline the process to become a host.Almost 60% of Airbnb’s revenue came from the U.S., where vaccines are now widely available, the company said. Guests are taking advantage of remote work policies and choosing to travel to non-urban areas and stay for longer: Nearly a quarter of Airbnb’s bookings in the first quarter were for stays longer than 28 days, an increase of 14% from 2019. Bookings in North America, primarily the U.S., increased to levels above 2019 in the first quarter, the company said.However, other countries are still struggling to contain Covid-19. India is reporting 4,000 deaths a day, meanwhile Europe’s vaccine rollout is lagging the U.S. and Australia has said its borders may be closed to international travelers for another year. As countries like the U.K. and France have announced reopenings and eased restrictions, Airbnb has seen a sharp increase in bookings, the company said. “We anticipate the pace of recovery in Europe will continue to be heavily influenced by the severity and duration of travel restrictions, but believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the recovery as they ease,” the company said.Releasing its financial results for the second time as a public company, Airbnb reported net loss of $1.17 billion, or $1.95 a share, significantly higher than the loss of $341 million a year earlier. Airbnb said it was due to the repayment of debt the company took on during the pandemic. In April 2020, Airbnb lined up about $2 billion in debt financing to help it grow and pay bills while travel demand was crushed.(Updates with comments from CEO beginning in the fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=378b15f1bbdd21f304350f8edb9f8d91728194a09c99701910ac6ffd7c783478

US online group Expedia has agreed to sell Egencia, its corporate travel division, to American Express Global Business Travel in a deal valuing the business at roughly $5.5bn.  Business travel management company TripActions announced its first acquisition on Wednesday with a deal for UK-based specialist Reed & Mackay for more than $250m in cash and shares.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=5ac3ec05380a30ec3df45ee7ec764f3fc72fdd4400a527fe8785715429ff0c9d
company,1620339947,Expedia Beats Estimates With Travel Demand ‘Roaring Back’,67643559,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/r250PYt1Zr1Hqd7L06uoUQ--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/d9641b2f7343b930b1d25636c925efc3,EXPE,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Expedia Group Inc. blitzed analysts’ estimates for several growth metrics in the first quarter, buoyed by a surge in domestic travel and vacation-rental demand.Gross bookings were down only 14% compared with a year earlier -- a significant improvement from the nearly 70% decline in the previous two quarters and better than analysts had expected. Revenue fell 44% to $1.25 billion, the Seattle-based company said Thursday in a statement, slightly ahead of analysts’ estimates. Shares climbed about 7% in extended trading.Still, the travel industry remains a “study in contrasts,” Chief Executive Officer Peter Kern said, as demand for international and business travel and conventional lodging remain challenged. “Beach and outdoor destinations have shown robust rebounds while major cities remain muted, and some regions have been growing while others remain locked down,” Kern said. “The market has clearly shown that when people feel safe to travel, demand comes roaring back.”After a year of pandemic-related border closures, steep revenue declines and mass layoffs, the travel sector is starting to see the green shoots of recovery. Booking Holdings Inc., the biggest online travel agency, on Wednesday reported a significant jump in the number of room-night reservations made in the beginning of the year. Analysts and industry experts expect the vaccine roll out in the U.S., which makes up more than 50% of Expedia’s revenue, will ignite a 2021 travel boom, driven largely by the alternative accommodation market.Expedia has seen booking trends “well above 2019 levels,” Kern said on a conference call with analysts after the results were released. Gross bookings, net of cancellations, were down about 40% in January. This improved to 20% in March and continued to show signs of growth into April, Kern said.“This is an unpredictable time,” Kern said. “Things could get worse before they get better, but we are optimistic we are seeing a lot of improvement across the globe.” The world will open up as the pace of vaccinations continues to increase, he said.Vrbo, which competes directly with Airbnb Inc., has weathered the pandemic better than its parent as travelers sought out regional staycations and remote work getaways. Expedia doesn’t disclose Vrbo metrics, but analysts expect the unit will lead Expedia’s recovery. Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman estimated Vrbo accounted for more than 40% of Expedia’s gross bookings value in the quarter, up from about 14% in the same period in 2019.Expedia has “amped up” its marketing investment in order to woo successful hosts from rival platforms, like Airbnb. “We are driving it as fast as we can,” Kern said.Truist Securities analyst Naved Khan predicted Vrbo would see “robust growth,” reflecting consumer interest in home rentals amid rising travel demand. “We estimate that Vrbo’s 2021 revenue could easily be 35% above 2019 levels,” Khan said in an interview before the results were released.Earlier this week, Expedia sold its corporate business travel arm, Egencia, to American Express Global Business Travel. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Expedia will become a shareholder and enter into a long-term commercial agreement with AmEx Global Business Travel as part of the agreement.Expedia reported an adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $58 million. Analysts were expecting a loss of $137.3 million. The adjusted loss per share was $2.02, beating the average analyst estimate of $2.27. Expedia’s shares are up about 25% this year, outperforming Booking and Airbnb, which were both up less than 5%.(Updates with comments from CEO in the fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=fd821a8f0aa84939d62e627c2ae636a657a3114073eedcd0d45b04eeb18113a3

company,1618441262,Harvard Pedigrees Opened the Door to World’s Biggest SPAC Deal,66250862,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Z9lzs14QTp.lm.FuPEGnIw--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/86e8392654cac0ee8680642d4a948b8d,EXPE,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- A few years after launching Grab Holdings Inc. in 2012, Anthony Tan got a piece of advice from Jack Ma. The co-founder of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. told the entrepreneur that life is a tsunami. When you’re up on the wave, get ready for the crash, he said.In 2020, that all came to pass. The coronavirus sent cities across Southeast Asia into lockdown. Demand for ride-hailing, a key business, plunged. Then around December, its big plan to merge with arch rival Gojek collapsed.Tan wasn’t ready to give up on going public. Early this year, a connection introduced him to the Silicon Valley investor Brad Gerstner, the founder of Altimeter Capital Management. The two men, though from opposite sides of the world, had a lot in common. Both were Harvard Business School alumni, and both had eschewed easier paths in life to set up their own firms.Within about three months, the pair had announced the world’s biggest SPAC deal, which will see Grab list in the U.S. at a valuation of almost $40 billion.“A year ago, the world looked like it was going to end,” Tan, 39, said. “As an entrepreneur, you go through these crazy lows and crazy highs.”In an interview over Zoom, Tan recalls that after the initial introduction was made, Gerstner called some common friends to check him out. They included Rich Barton, the entrepreneur who leads Zillow Group Inc., and Uber Technologies Inc. Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi, a Grab board member. Tan passed the test.Read more: Singapore’s Grab to List in U.S. in $40 Billion SPAC DealThe Grab-Altimeter special purpose acquisition company merger underscores the importance that’s placed on connections at the top of the technology world, and how graduating from universities like Harvard still helps to open doors.Gerstner has also invested in Coupang Inc., the Korean e-commerce giant founded by Bom Kim, who attended Harvard Business School around the same time as Tan before Kim dropped out. Grab rival Gojek was founded by Nadiem Makarim, a Harvard Business School classmate of Tan who’s now Indonesia’s education minister.So many billions were “created out of that class,” Gerstner, 49, said.Their three companies already have a combined valuation of about $130 billion, including almost $80 billion for Coupang after its initial public offering in March.“The world is shrinking,” Gerstner said. “Some of the most exciting leadership today is in regions like Southeast Asia.”Tan, born into a wealthy business family in Malaysia, got the inspiration to start Grab during his time at Harvard Business School from 2009 to 2011. He quit the family business, Tan Chong Motor Holdings Bhd. and started a taxi-hailing service known as MyTeksi with his Harvard classmate Tan Hooi Ling. Later Grab would expand into businesses including food delivery and online payments as it became a so-called super-app in Southeast Asia.Gerstner was in Harvard about a decade earlier, from 1999 to 2000. The American investor grew up in a small town in Indiana, admiring Warren Buffett. He started his career as a securities lawyer handling IPOs. After getting his MBA from Harvard, he joined the venture capital firm General Catalyst and later founded and sold three companies.In the depths of the global financial crisis in 2008, he set out on his own, establishing Altimeter Capital with just $3 million raised from friends and family. Today the firm, which invests in public and private technology companies, manages $15 billion. He’s backed tech players including Expedia Group Inc., Uber and software firm Snowflake Inc.Tan, a fixture at the World Economic Forum, has always stressed the importance of business partnerships. He spends much of his time networking, according to people who know him. On the eve of the merger announcement, Tan said he was out having dinner with a merchant partner.When in Indonesia, Tan abandons his signature black t-shirt and puts on a traditional batik shirt. He addresses conference guests in Indonesian. When visiting Tokyo to attend a SoftBank Group Corp. conference in 2019, he bowed deeply after SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son, his most early ardent supporter, introduced him as “a new superstar in the AI era.”SoftBank invested about $3 billion in Grab, but relations with Son cooled after the Japanese company put pressure on Grab to combine with Gojek, according to people familiar with the matter.Tan said his relationship with Son is still close. During the Zoom interview, he took out his phone and read aloud a text that he said he received from Son about the merger. “Anthony, thank you so much for the update. I’m really happy to hear that the IPO is going well,” Tan read.Gerstner, meanwhile, says he’s impressed by how Grab persevered through the pandemic -- and by its decision, like his own, to plough its own furrow.Grab “ultimately chose an independent path,” he said. “It’s simply one of the biggest internet companies doing one of the biggest IPOs of the year.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d7839071b645a75b70fc4906b9c2f34048769a15aafee518413f97505024e856

The potential transaction could also involve raising between $500 million and $750 million through a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, the people said. Details including the amount to be raised could change as the companies start discussions with potential investors, they added.Representatives for Bridgetown and Traveloka declined to comment.Shares in Bridgetown Holdings rose about 6% in pre-market trading in New York, extending their 13% gain on Thursday.The deal would make Jakarta-based Traveloka one of the first Southeast Asian unicorns to go public through a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. Grab Holdings Inc. is in advanced talks to go that route through Altimeter Capital’s first SPAC, which may value the company at about $40 billion, Bloomberg News reported last month.Read more: Traveloka Is Said to Pick JPMorgan for U.S. Listing via SPACTraveloka was valued in 2020 at around $2.75 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.Bridgetown raised about $595 million in a U.S. initial public offering in October. The company’s sponsor is a collaboration between Thiel Capital, Thiel’s personal investment vehicle based in Los Angeles, and Pacific Century Group, a Hong Kong-based investment company led by Li.Founded in 2012, Traveloka has expanded its reach across six Southeast Asian nations and also covers Australia, making it easier for consumers to book flights and hotels across countries. Like other startups in the region, the company has sought to grow its offering with complementary services, extending into finance alongside its travel, lifestyle and accommodation booking portfolio.Traveloka’s backers include Expedia Group Inc., Rocket Internet, East Ventures, Li’s FWD Group Ltd. and Singapore’s GIC Pte.(Adds pre-market trading in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=8e779e99ad506039b181626402c8e5e075fd879da55693777a493112b17edfaa
