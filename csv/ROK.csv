A spike in coronavirus in Asia and Australia appears to be fueling some concerns. Those concerns are curtailing any movement to the upside, following last week’s bounce-back.



The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures was down 0.15%, Nasdaq Futures up 0.17% and S&P 500 down 0.03% at the time of writing, pointing to a cautious open later in the day. A cool-down in the bullish momentum comes after the major indices reached record highs last week on weaker-than-expected U.S. inflation data. News of a bipartisan U.S. infrastructure agreement also helped boost risk appetite, sending the major indices higher.



Once the North America session opens, the focus will be on Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (JEF), LiveXLive Media Inc. (LIVX), High Tide Inc. (HITI), WeTrade Group Inc. (WETG), and Key Energy Services Inc. (KEGX). All of those companies are expected to report their quarterly earnings reports.



Virgin Galactic (SPCE) was the most active in pre-market trading. The stock was up by 6.06%, with 922.84K shares exchanging hands at the time of writing. The spike came on the heels of the company's confirmation that it had been granted a license by the Federal Aviation Administration to fly passengers on future spaceflights.



Torchlight Energy (TRCH) was the biggest gainer, with its shares jumping 140.20% on a volume of 48.04K shares at the time of writing. The rally comes on the company's announcement that it has paid a special Series A preferred stock Dividend. The company has also implemented a 1 for 2 reverse stock split of its common stock.



Greenland Technologies (GTEC) was the biggest loser in pre-market activity at the time of writing, dropping by 15.44% on a volume of 14.48k shares. The slide comes just days after the technology developer and manufacturer of industrial electric vehicles confirmed plans to offer ordinary shares for sale in an underwritten public offering. The company intends to use net proceeds from the offering for general corporate and working capital needs.



In M&A news, Amazon (AMZN) cloud unit Amazon Web Services is acquiring Wickr, a company that specializes in developing secure end-to-end encrypted communication technology. The technology should strengthen AWS messaging capabilities, allowing cloud users access to advanced security features not available in traditional messaging services.



“Enterprise customers use Wickr to keep communications between employees and business partners private, while remaining compliant with regulatory requirements,” said AWS in a press release.



Additionally, Rockwell Automation (ROK) has reached an agreement to acquire Plex Systems in a $2.22 billion transaction. The provider of industrial automation and digital transformation intends to finance the all-cash deal through short-term and long-term debt. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.



Blake Moret, the company’s Chairman and CEO, said, “This acquisition will accelerate our strategy to bring the Connected Enterprise to life, driving faster time to value for our customers, as they increasingly adopt cloud solutions to improve resilience, agility, and sustainability in their operations.”



Paychex (PAYX) shares jumped 1.3% after the company reported impressive Q4 financial results for the fiscal quarter ended May 31. Adjusted earnings were up 18% year-over-year to $0.72 a share, as revenue rose 12% year-over-year to $1.03 billion. Earnings beat consensus estimates of $0.67 a share, and revenue topped estimates of $980.48 million.



President and CEO of Paychex Martin Mucci said, “Our fourth quarter results were driven by record client retention levels, record sales results, and stronger checks per client, which were driven by improving macroeconomic conditions and gains in employment.”



Facebook (FB) is planning to make it possible for Instagram users to share and post content using desktop computers. Bloomberg reports that the social networking giant has been testing the desktop posting and sharing feature.



“We know that many people access Instagram from their computer…To improve that experience, we’re now testing the ability to create a Feed post on Instagram with their desktop browser.” said Christine Pai, Facebook spokeswoman.



Apple (AAPL) is seeking a five-year extension on its planning permit for its $1 billion data center in Galway, Western Ireland. According to the Business Post, if successful, the company will have until 2026 to build the data center. As it stands, the company has until September 21 to have the facility up and running.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d10ba10dc86051d207d911b2723bd6d83f9cf218fa0627b6171ea052cd9a8cc5

(ROK), a provider of industrial automation and digital transformation, inked an all-cash deal to buy Plex Systems for $2.22 billion. The transaction will be funded by short-term and long-term debt and is expected to close in the fiscal fourth quarter, subject to certain closing conditions. (See Rockwell Automation stock chart on TipRanks)



Plex Systems is a leading subscription-based smart manufacturing platform that helps customers connect, automate, track, and analyze their operations and connected supply chains. The company has over 700 customers and manages more than 8 billion transactions per day.



The deal will be immediately accretive to Rockwell’s operating margins and is expected to fast-track the achievement of its annual recurring revenue goal by approximately two years.



Blake Moret, the company’s Chairman and CEO, said, “This acquisition will accelerate our strategy to bring the Connected Enterprise to life, driving faster time to value for our customers, as they increasingly adopt cloud solutions to improve resilience, agility, and sustainability in their operations.”



Plex, which has 500 employees, will be integrated into Rockwell’s Software and Control operating segment. That segment provides leading hardware and software offerings for the design, operation, and maintenance of production automation and management systems.



Bill Berutti, CEO of Plex, said, “Joining forces with Rockwell is great for our customers, partners, and employees as we move to expand our reach and impact and accelerate our mission to bring manufacturing to the cloud.”



Following the news, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Scott Graham maintained a Hold rating on the stock with a price target of $260, implying a 9% downside potential from current levels.



Graham said, “We believe Plex fits well with ROK's Factory Talk platform and its Connected Enterprise initiatives. Its sales are recurring. But $2.22B transaction value is a lot of capital deployment for a deal which will not move the earnings needle much in fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2022 in our estimation.”



Rockwell has an overall Hold consensus rating based on 3 Buys, 5 Holds, and 2 Sells. The average analyst Rockwell Automation price target  of $264 implies a 7.6% downside potential to current levels. Shares gained 36.9% over the past year.



Also, according to TipRanks’ Smart Score system, ROK gets a 7 out of 10, which indicates that the stock is likely to perform in line with market averages.

The company is working with advisers as it weighs alternatives, which could also include a commercial partnership with a major manufacturer, they said.Aspen Tech makes software for companies in industries such as chemicals, manufacturing, energy, metals and mining, its website shows. Shares of the company rose as much as 2.9% Wednesday, hitting the highest intraday level in two weeks. They were up 1.1% at 9:49 a.m. in New York, giving Aspen Tech a market value of $9.5 billion.The company has long been considered an attractive takeover target for big industrial companies looking to expand in software. However, high price expectations and management reluctance have been hurdles for a full sale over the years despite interest from potential acquirers, the people said.Deliberations are ongoing and may not lead to a transaction, the people said. A representative for Bedford, Massachusetts-based Aspen Tech declined to comment.Industrial firms have been shifting their focus from machinery to technology and automation. Last year, Aveva Group Plc agreed to acquire industrial-software maker Osisoft for about $5 billion, while Emerson Electric Co. agreed to buy Open Systems International Inc. for $1.6 billion.Software companies also have sometimes sought investments from potential buyers, including industrial companies. In 2018, Rockwell Automation Inc. agreed to make a $1 billion equity investment in industrial software company PTC Inc. as part of a strategic partnership, according to a statement at the time.Honeywell International Inc., which has been seeking to marry software capabilities with its industrial know-how, agreed in December to acquire Sparta Systems for $1.3 billion to gain technology used in the life sciences industry. The company said in April it’s transferring its listing to the Nasdaq as it seeks to stress its technology focus.(Updates with share movement in third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d90e1009759b127b0a71b3be9ae4d25059edf2784627e40f0eb40386c53dd97d

company,1612974068,Looking Into Rockwell Automation's Return On Capital Employed,66707527,,ROK,Yahoo,"Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) posted Q1 earnings of $271.90 million, an increase from Q4 of 4.56%. Sales dropped to $1.57 billion, a 0.3% decrease between quarters. Rockwell Automation earned $284.90 million, and sales totaled $1.57 billion in Q4. Why ROCE Is Significant Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q1, Rockwell Automation posted an ROCE of 0.15%. Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future. View more earnings on ROK Return on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders. For Rockwell Automation, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.
