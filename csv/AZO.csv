However, shares fell almost 2% on May 25. The company’s revenues of $3.7 billion surpassed the Street’s estimates of $3.26 billion and jumped 31.4% from the year-ago period. Earnings came in at $26.48 per share, beating the consensus estimates of $20.14 per share and soared 84% year-over-year. The increase in earnings was driven by stronger commercial sales in the quarter. Notably, domestic same store sales increased 28.9% in the fiscal third quarter. AutoZone CEO Bill Rhodes said, “The investments we are making in Commercial pricing, service and assortment are strengthening our competitive position in this large, fragmented market. We intend to accelerate our Company’s historical Commercial growth rate as we increase our penetration in this market.” He added, “While we understand sales trends will slow, we must work diligently during this fourth quarter to maintain the share gains we have achieved…Additionally, we remain committed to investing appropriately in a safe and productive environment for our customers and AutoZoners.” (See AutoZone stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the fiscal Q3 earnings release, Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel assigned a Buy rating and a price target of $1,670 (17.6% upside potential). Nagel commented, “We look very favorably upon recent trends at AZO and view accelerating sales and profitability at the company as reflective of management capitalizing successfully on economic re-opening tailwinds and consistent with our positive near- and longer-term calls on shares.” The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 11 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $1,588.46 implies 11.8% upside potential to current levels. Shares have increased 26.9% over the past six months.

(NYSE: AZO) today reported net sales of $3.7 billion for its third quarter (12 weeks) ended May 8, 2021, an increase of 31.4% from the third quarter of fiscal 2020 (12 weeks). Domestic same store sales, or sales for stores open at least one year, increased 28.9% for the quarter. For the quarter, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 52.4%, a decrease of 118 basis points versus the prior year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by the accelerated growth in our Commercial business and our investment in pricing initiatives. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, was 30.4% versus 35.9% for last year’s quarter. The decrease in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, was driven by strong sales growth and approximately $75 million in prior year pandemic related expenses, including Emergency Time-Off (“ETO”) for our AutoZoners. Operating profit increased 63.4% to $803.5 million. Net income for the quarter increased 73.9% over the same period last year to $596.2 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 84.0% to $26.48 per share from $14.39 per share in the year-ago quarter. The increase in net income was driven by strong topline growth and operating expense leverage. AutoZone repurchased 663,328 shares of its common stock for $900.0 million during the third quarter, at an average price of $1,357 per share. At the end of the third quarter, the Company had $1.3 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization. The Company’s inventory increased 5.1% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and improved product assortment. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, on a per store basis, was negative $167 thousand versus negative $56 thousand last year and negative $93 thousand last quarter.“We are very proud to report another quarter of exceptionally strong same store sales and earnings growth. The AutoZone team has done a wonderful job of managing, and leading, throughout this pandemic. While our DIY business was again very strong this quarter, our Commercial business’ 44% sales growth stood out as exceptional. The investments we are making in Commercial pricing, service and assortment are strengthening our competitive position in this large, fragmented market. We intend to accelerate our Company’s historical Commercial growth rate as we increase our penetration in this market. While we understand sales trends will slow, we must work diligently during this fourth quarter to maintain the share gains we have achieved. As always, we cannot take anything for granted, but we remain excited about the ongoing sales opportunities in front of us. Additionally, we remain committed to investing appropriately in a safe and productive environment for our customers and AutoZoners. As we opportunistically invest capital in our business, we remain committed to our disciplined approach of increasing operating earnings and cash flow, and of utilizing our balance sheet and capital effectively,” said Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. During the quarter ended May 8, 2021, AutoZone opened 25 new stores and closed one store in the U.S. and opened seven stores in Mexico and one store in Brazil. As of May 8, 2021, the Company had 5,975 stores in the U.S., 635 in Mexico and 47 in Brazil for a total store count of 6,657.

At the end of the second quarter (ended Feb. 13), the company had $717.6 million remaining under the existing authorization. Since the inception of AutoZone’s (AZO) stock buyback program in 1998, the board of directors has authorized share repurchases of $26.15 billion, including the recent authorization. Shares declined 1.3% to close at $1,323.57 on March 23. AutoZone’s CFO Jamere Jackson commented, “AutoZone’s continued strong financial performance allows us to grow our business, return meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders and maintain our investment grade credit ratings.” Earlier this month, the company reported fiscal 2Q results. Net earnings jumped 20.5% on a year-over-year basis to $14.93 per share and beat Street estimates of $12.84 per share. Net sales increased 15.8% to $2.91 billion and exceeded analysts’ expectations of $2.76 billion. (See AutoZone stock analysis on TipRanks) On March 17, Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem raised the stock’s price target to $1,500 (13.3% upside potential) from $1,375 and maintained a Buy rating. Fadem reiterated his bullish stance on aftermarket auto part retailers on an “onslaught” of prospective 2021 upside catalysts, which are not reflected in the current valuation. Currently, Fadem believes that AutoZone’s share price reflects an attractive entry point. The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 4 Buys and 3 Holds. The average analyst price target of $1,419.29 implies 7.2% upside potential to current levels. Shares have jumped 63.7% over the past year.
