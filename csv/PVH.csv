PVH Corp's CEO Stefan Larsson said it was a tough decision to exit the Heritage business because these brands were the foundation that built PVH as a leading fashion company. 



Larsson stated, “This transaction reflects our commitment to driving our next chapter of sustainable, profitable growth – focused on the Calvin Klein and TOMMY HILFIGER brands, our international markets, driving product strength with increased pricing power and margin expansion, and winning in the marketplace through super-charging e-commerce.”



PVH will still continue to own its underwear and intimate businesses, including the Warner brand, which complement its neckwear and dress shirts business. 



As a result of the sale, the company lowered its full guidance and now expects full-year revenue to increase by 22% to 24%, down from the initial forecast of 24% to 26% increase. On a Non-GAAP basis, full-year earnings per share are expected at $6.5, up from prior guidance of $5.5.



Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow has reiterated a Hold rating on the stock but raised the price target to $110 from $90, implying a 2.1% upside potential from current levels. According to the analyst, the company continues to see solid growth overseas, with the U.S. improvement around the corner.



Boruchow stated, “Expect beat & raise story to continue, though 2H21 Street expectations likely to be revised downward. The print itself was not overly surprising, and we don't believe bears nor bulls took much out of it.”



Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 7 Buys, 6 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst PVH price target of $119.08 implies 10.6% upside potential from current levels.



PVH scores 6 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, suggesting that the stock is likely to perform in line with market averages.

For Q2, PVH expects revenues to increase 34% to 36% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings are expected in the range of $1.15 to $1.18 versus the consensus estimate of $1.22.



PVH increased its full-year 2021 outlook despite continued uncertainty in the macro environment. It projects revenues to increase 24% to 26% year-over-year. Additionally, non-GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be $6.50. The consensus estimate for EPS is pegged at $6.16.



On April 13, Guggenheim analyst Robert Drbul reiterated the stock’s price target of $120 (9.7% upside potential) and a Buy rating. 



Drbul commented, “Given the company's actions to streamline its organization in recent months, coupled with a potentially normalizing retail environment in 2021 (including improving levels of store traffic, a potential return of tourism travel & spend, and an increase in discretionary spend on more formal apparel, all of which PVH stands to benefit from), we believe PVH will be emerging from the pandemic a stronger, leaner, and more profitable company with some favorable YoY tailwinds in 2021.”



The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 6 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $112.25 implies 2.6% upside potential to current levels. Shares have increased 24.1% over the past six months.

Shares of the premium apparel retailer closed 1.1% lower in Tuesday’s extended trading session. PVH Corporation (PVH) reported a loss of $0.38 per share for the quarter, which was wider than Street estimates of $0.35. The bottom-line result also compared unfavorably with the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.88 per share. 4Q revenues of $2.09 billion missed analysts’ expectations of $2.12 billion and declined 20% on a year-over-year basis. PVH said that about 70% of its stores across Europe and Canada were closed due to the pandemic. While company-operated stores were negatively impacted, PVH recorded robust growth in its digital sales. Revenues through digital channels grew 57% during the quarter. Moreover, it noted a 68% increase in sales through its directly operated digital commerce businesses. (See PVH stock analysis on TipRanks) For 2021, PVH projects revenues to grow between 22% and 24% year-on-year. The company anticipates generating non-GAAP earnings of $6 per share during the period. Following the earnings release, Guggenheim analyst Robert Drbul reiterated his Buy rating and price target of $120 (19.9% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, Drbul wrote, “Given the company’s actions to streamline its organization in recent months, coupled with a potentially normalizing retail environment in 2021 (including improving levels of store traffic, a return of tourism travel & spend, and an increase in discretionary spend on more formal apparel, all of which PVH stands to benefit from), we believe PVH will be emerging from the pandemic a stronger, leaner, and more profitable company with some favorable YoY tailwinds in 2021.” The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 4 Buys and 3 Holds. The average analyst price target of $109.86 implies 9.7% upside potential to current levels. Shares have rallied about 162% in one year.

Here is Benzinga's everything-that-matters guide for this Tuesday's Q4 earnings announcement. Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS. Earnings And Revenue Analysts covering PVH have modeled for quarterly EPS loss of $0.31 on revenue of $2.12 billion. PVH reported a per-share profit of $1.88 when it published results during the same quarter last year. Sales in that period totaled $2.60 billion. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the ""consensus estimates."" A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an ""earnings surprise"" and may move the stock by a considerable margin. View more earnings on PVH The analyst consensus estimate would represent a 116.49% decrease in the company's earnings. Sales would have fallen 18.49% from the same quarter last year. The company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past like this: Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 EPS Estimate 0.24 -2.42 -1.28 1.81 EPS Actual 1.32 0.13 -3.03 1.88 Revenue Estimate 2.00 B 1.25 B 1.40 B 2.50 B Revenue Actual 2.12 B 1.58 B 1.34 B 2.60 B Stock Performance Shares of PVH were trading at $101.95 as of March 26. Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 166.76%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders are probably satisfied going into this earnings release.
