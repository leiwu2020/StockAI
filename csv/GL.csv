It was also announced that shareholders of Globe Life's stock as of January 8, 2021 are entitled to the dividend. The stock is expected to become ex-dividend 1 business day(s) before the record date. Globe Life has an ex-dividend date set for for January 7, 2021. The company's current dividend payout is $0.19, which equates to a dividend yield of 0.81% at current price levels.What Are Ex-Dividend Dates? Ex-dividend dates signal when company shares cease to trade with their current dividend payouts. There is a small intermission period before companies announce new dividends. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Most ex-dividend dates operate on a quarterly basis.Understanding Globe Life's Dividend Payouts And Yields Over the past year, Globe Life has seen its dividend payouts and yields climb upward overall. Last year (January 2, 2020), the company's payout sat at $0.17, which has since increased by $0.02. Globe Life's dividend yield last year was 0.7%, which has since grown by 0.11%.  Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market.To read more about Globe Life click here.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Ex-Dividend Date Insight: Gentex  * Ex-Dividend Date Insight: Owens-Corning(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.
