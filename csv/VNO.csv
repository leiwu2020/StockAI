Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have also renewed leases at the skyscraper.Last year, Vornado tried selling 555 California and Manhattan’s 1290 Avenue of the Americas, which it also owns with Trump.

COVID-19 Pandemic Our business has been adversely affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the preventive measures taken to curb the spread of the virus. Some of the effects on us include the following: With the exception of grocery stores and other ""essential"" businesses, many of our retail tenants closed their stores in March 2020 and began reopening when New York City entered phase two of its state-mandated reopening plan on June 22, 2020, however, there continue to be limitations on occupancy and other restrictions that affect their ability to resume full operations.While our buildings remain open, many of our office tenants are working remotely.We temporarily closed the Hotel Pennsylvania on April 1, 2020 and on April 5, 2021, we announced that we permanently closed the hotel.We cancelled trade shows at theMART beginning late March of 2020 and expect to resume trade shows in the third quarter of 2021.As of April 30, 2021, approximately 70% of the 1,293 Building Maintenance Services LLC (""BMS"") employees that had been placed on furlough in 2020 have returned to work. While we believe our tenants are required to pay rent under their leases and we have commenced legal proceedings against certain tenants that have failed to pay under their leases, in limited circumstances, we have agreed to and may continue to agree to rent deferrals and rent abatements for certain of our tenants. For the quarter ended March 31, 2021, we collected 96% of rent due from our tenants, comprised of 97% from our office tenants and 90% from our retail tenants. Based on our assessment of the probability of rent collection of our lease receivables, we have written off $1,001,000 of receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents for the three months ended March 31, 2021. In addition, we have written off $2,910,000 of tenant receivables deemed uncollectible for the three months ended March 31, 2021. These write-offs resulted in a reduction of lease revenues and our share of income from partially owned entities. Prospectively, revenue recognition for lease receivables deemed uncollectible will be based on actual amounts received. In light of the evolving health, social, economic, and business environment, governmental regulation or mandates, and business disruptions that have occurred and may continue to occur, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial condition and operating results remains highly uncertain but that impact has been and may continue to be material. The impact on us includes lower rental income and potentially lower occupancy levels at our properties which will result in less cash flow available for operating costs, to pay our indebtedness and for distribution to our shareholders. We have experienced a decrease in cash flow from operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced collections of rents billed to certain of our tenants, the closure of Hotel Pennsylvania, the cancellation of trade shows at theMART, and lower revenues from BMS and signage. The value of our real estate assets may decline, which may result in non-cash impairment charges in future periods and that impact could be material.

Certain statements contained herein may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could materially affect the outcome of our forward-looking statements and our future results and financial condition, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Such factors include, among others, risks associated with the timing of and costs associated with property improvements, financing commitments and general competitive factors. Currently, one of the most significant factors is the ongoing adverse effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, operating performance and the effect it has had and may continue to have on our tenants, the global, national, regional and local economies and financial markets and the real estate market in general. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic, which are highly uncertain at this time but that impact could be material. Moreover, you are cautioned that the COVID-19 pandemic will heighten many of the risks identified in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.

NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciable real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because they exclude the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, we also disclose FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, as adjusted. Although this non-GAAP measure clearly differs from NAREIT’s definition of FFO, we believe it provides a meaningful presentation of operating performance. Reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions are provided on the following page.

company,1619805222,Trump Scores $617 Million of Cash With Vornado From Tower Bonds,67179881,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vZNWyNN7NaucNpx99tr3EQ--~B/aD04ODE7dz0xMzIwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/2d53b29c3906baee7dad392bbb92a994,VNO,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors snapped up $1.2 billion of bonds linked to a San Francisco office tower that makes up much of Donald Trump’s fortune.The AAA slice of the commercial mortgage-backed security sold Friday with a discount margin, or risk premium, of 125 basis points over one-month Libor -- roughly in line with other recent office-tower deals.The bonds are being used to refinance a loan on the 555 California Street property in a deal that gives joint owners Vornado Realty Trust and Trump a $617 million payout.The complex, among the tallest buildings in San Francisco, is one of two Trump-linked office towers that Vornado is refinancing. The other is in New York. While Vornado majority owns them, Trump’s 30% stake is the most valuable part of his portfolio, making up about one-third of his $2.3 billion fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.The refinancing -- and cash windfall for Vornado and Trump -- comes months after several banks tied to the former president said they would no longer work with him after the deadly U.S. Capitol riot in January.‘Trump’s Poor Record’While the bond found strong demand, at least one investor was put off by the Trump connection.“We looked at the deal and it did not pass our Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) process because of Trump’s poor record (going back to the 1990s) of not only paying back investors, but being difficult when he runs into difficulties,” John Kerschner, head of securitized products at Janus Henderson, said in an interview.Kerschner said the offering priced tighter than some other “esoteric” office-tower CMBS deals with somewhat lower-quality properties, such as a recent deal underpinned by a loan on office towers in downtown Houston. On the other hand, the deal priced the same or slightly wider than some deals tied to higher-quality trophy towers, he added.Proceeds of the 555 California Street CMBS will fund improvements to the buildings and return about $617 million to the owners, according to a marketing document obtained by Bloomberg.“For a complex that couldn’t be sold last year, a large equity return is arguably the next best thing for the sponsor,” said Christopher Sullivan, chief investment officer at the United Nations Federal Credit Union. “It is a trophy property in a prime location with stable, high-quality diverse tenants and high occupancy for the area given the pandemic.”Sullivan sees risks, though. The loan is structured as interest-only throughout, which may increase refinancing risk, on top of moderate leverage. Moreover, one-third of tenants also have the option to terminate their leases, “which is not surprising given the level of leasing or space-requirement uncertainties. However, it may present net cash flow risk,” he noted.New York NextMeanwhile, the refinancing of the New York tower at 1290 Avenue of the Americas is “on deck,“ Steve Roth, Vornado’s chief executive officer, said in a letter to shareholders earlier this month.The refinancing comes after Vornado tried selling the two assets last year. It shelved the effort after not reaching its pricing goals.“We found investors to be uncertain, distracted and handicapped by inability to travel,” Roth said in the letter to shareholders. “As markets improve, we may well revisit other alternatives for these two buildings,” he added.Earlier this week, Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and Donald Trump’s son, described the properties as “arguably two of the best commercial assets anywhere in the country.”Trump has at least $590 million in debt coming due in the next four years on other properties owned by the Trump Organization, more than half of which is personally guaranteed.

Proceeds will fund improvements to the buildings and return about $617 million to the owners, according to a marketing document obtained by Bloomberg.A similar deal on 1290 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan is in the works, Roth said this month, though it couldn’t be determined if that loan will also pay a dividend.While Vornado is the majority owner of the properties, Trump’s 30% stake in the towers is the most valuable part of his portfolio, making up about one-third of his $2.3 billion fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The refinancing -- and potential cash windfall -- comes months after several banks tied to the former president said they would no longer work with him in the fallout of the deadly Capitol riot.Trump has at least $590 million in debt coming due in the next four years on other properties owned by the Trump Organization, more than half of which is personally guaranteed. Some of those properties, such as the company’s Washington, D.C., hotel and its golf resort near Miami, have suffered from plunging revenue during the pandemic.“We are one of the most under-leveraged real estate companies in the country relative to our assets,” said Eric Trump, executive vice president of Trump Organization.Trump and Vornado are benefiting from an opportune time to refinance property debt as the Federal Reserve keeps rates at record lows and the government pumps money into the economy. With few sources of reliable income across markets globally, investors have turned to the relatively higher yields of securities like commercial mortgage bonds. Demand has extended even to office towers, even with the lingering uncertainty over when workers will return.Despite Covid-19 shuttering offices and turning San Francisco’s financial district into a ghost town for more than a year, Vornado and Trump’s campus of three properties was more than 90% leased as of February, according to the marketing materials. The main tenants of the property include Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley.Vornado tried selling the two assets it owns with Trump last year, but shelved the effort after not reaching their pricing goals.“We found investors to be uncertain, distracted, and handicapped by inability to travel,” Roth, Vornado’s chief executive officer, said in a letter to shareholders earlier this month. “As markets improve, we may well revisit other alternatives for these two buildings,” he added.Roth said in the letter that Vornado is in the process of refinancing 555 California and that the same process for 1290 Avenue of the Americas is “on deck.”Eric Trump described the properties as “arguably two of the best commercial assets anywhere in the country.”Still for Vornado, the connection to Trump may not be that helpful. In February, Roth emphasized Trump’s limited role in the ownership of the two properties.“His role in the buildings is totally passive,” Roth said on an earnings call. “He’s OK with that and I’m delighted with that.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f7bf32b767a4ad28c63af7cfc479fe0b6baec5aaada829f772fd72862d48f7ab

The developers are proposing a 1,600-foot skyscraper that would be among the tallest in the Western Hemisphere.Manhattan has been one of the hardest-hit places in the U.S. over the past year. But even as Covid-19 has crushed commercial-property values, developers are making big-money bets that it’s only a matter of time before Manhattan is Manhattan again.“Developers are optimistic by nature,” said Jim Costello, senior vice president at Real Capital Analytics. “The market they care about isn’t the here and now. It’s about where the market will be when their project is complete.”Read more: Fink Frets Over NYC’s Future, Fearing an Exodus Over TaxesAfter office construction in New York City ground to a virtual halt in the second and third quarters of last year, developers began work on $2.7 billion worth of projects in the final three months of 2020, according to data from Real Capital Analytics.That was down roughly one-third from the fourth quarter of 2019, but large enough to show builders and lenders haven’t lost their appetite for risk.Still, New York City landlords are digging out of a deep hole. The city has estimated that the value of Manhattan office buildings will drop 25%, with hotels worth 31% less. Apartment rents have slid amid a flood of vacancies, while key retail corridors are plagued by empty storefronts.Read more: At Long Last, Wall Street Sees Path to Return to the OfficeNew York commercial mortgage-backed securities saw a surge in delinquent loans over the past year, reaching a total balance of $5.8 billion in March, according to data firm Trepp. That equates to an overall delinquency rate of 5.77%. The jump was largely due to pain in the retail and hotel industries, though office delinquencies also soared.There are signs of revival in Manhattan these days. Foot traffic is ticking up in Times Square and other key corridors as tourists trickle back. Comedy clubs are open and restaurant tables are filling up with weather getting warmer.Vornado Realty Trust Chief Executive Officer Steven Roth’s ambitious plans for the area around Penn Station are a bet that office workers will eventually stream back into Midtown, which is key to Manhattan’s recovery.“The success of our business will continue to depend upon talented workers gathering together,” Roth wrote in a recent letter to shareholders. “I guess the kitchen table has a place for some, but I continue to believe the urban office is the future of work.”Across town, the project to build a new office tower at the site of the Grand Hyatt is now nearly 30% bigger than when it was introduced two years ago. And developers RXR Realty and TF Cornerstone are moving forward with plans to put a 500-room hotel at the top of the building.SL Green Realty Corp., the city’s largest office landlord, secured a $1.25 billion construction loan to redevelop a giant office tower in the tech-friendly Flatiron district. The firm also opened One Vanderbilt in September, a $3.3 billion skyscraper near Grand Central that is about 75% leased and features a restaurant by Daniel Boulud. A couple blocks away, Boston Properties Inc. has proposed an office tower that may rise more 1,000 feet at a former MTA building on Madison Avenue.Read More: Apollo Weighs Florida Outposts as Escape From New York Heats UpEven as vaccines fuel optimism about a return to the office, it’s easy to be skeptical about these projects. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is building a massive new headquarters near Grand Central, but CEO Jamie Dimon recently said he envisions some employees working remotely, with the bank perhaps needing maybe 60 seats for every 100 employees.Other finance firms, meanwhile, are expanding in Florida as wealthy financiers move south to avoid New York’s higher taxes. In a recent research note, Bank of America Corp. analyst James Feldman downgraded SL Green and Vornado, arguing that a decrease in demand for space will weigh on rents into 2023.For now, most of Manhattan’s employees are staying home as companies eye a return after September’s Labor Day holiday. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan have said they’ll bring their summer interns to the office, but fewer than 14% of workers in the New York metropolitan area were back at their desks as of April 7, according to data from Kastle Systems.Office availability, meanwhile, is at the highest level in at least 30 years, worse than it was after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the financial crisis.Still, New York has bounced back before, and its status as a business hub should help fuel the rebound, even if it takes time, according to Kathy Wylde, CEO of Partnership for New York City.“Manhattan is well-positioned for the future because it’s a global hub of finance, tech and education, which are keys to success in the innovation economy,” she said. “The rebound in the office market will not, in my view, happen quickly.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=48c90de31e8319eee795e4bbd1589104452795a37f54152b9366b9ff8b56bf23

The Pennsylvania may have been a grande dame in its time, but it is decades past its glory and sell-by date.”The news comes a year after Vornado shut down the hotel in response to the pandemic. The Manhattan-based landlord is also planning to separate its developments around Penn Station through a new tracking stock. The move would give investors the ability to choose between the “higher growth but longer-term” Penn District properties or the company’s traditional core assets, Roth said.Vornado’s shares fell 44% in 2020 but have since rebounded. They have gained 22% so far this year.Like other landlords, the company has taken a hit as Covid-19 roiled New York’s real estate industry. Hotels, stores and restaurants have suffered from social-distancing measures. And with office workers slow to return after the lockdown, many tenants have been questioning their space needs. Building sales and new leasing have dropped dramatically because of uncertainty in the market.Vornado tried to sell two offices towers that it co-owns with the Trump Organization last year to no avail. It also recorded hundreds of millions in losses on its investment in a Manhattan retail joint venture.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ddf16b89c779d8a06df76a33ba108730364cc3bc5056ad68e6f24b77c56099f1

Last month, several Wall Street analysts turned bullish on high-yielding dividend stocks – recommending defensive plays even as the market was trending strongly upwards. And... then we had the short-squeeze frenzy to finish off January, leading to the worst month for the major stock indexes since October. The market’s current conditions remain bullish overall, but the events of the past 10 days have reminded us all of the value in keeping a defensive segment to the portfolio.Against this backdrop, we've used the TipRanks database to pinpoint three high-yield dividend stocks that all share some important features; They are paying out reliable dividends with upwards of 5% yield. And, in each case, at least one of Wall Street’s analysts has turned bullish (i.e. upgraded the stock). Given that analysts usually reiterate recommendations, upgrades are a clear sign of increasing confidence in a company’s outlook.Regency Centers Corporation (REG)We will start with Regency Centers, a Florida-based real estate investment trust (REIT). There is no surprise finding a REIT in a list of high-yielding dividend stocks; these companies are required by tax code compliance to return a high percentage of profits to their shareholders, and frequently use dividends as the vehicle.Regency holds a diverse portfolio of desirable retail locations, 408 in total across 30 states, with 56 million square feet of leasable space. Even with the decline in brick-and-mortar retail due to the ongoing corona crisis, this portfolio has proven to be a continuing asset. The spaces are mainly shopping centers, located in affluent urban areas, and anchored by reliable, chain grocery stores.In the third quarter of 2020, the last with numbers available, the company reported that its properties had a 93.4% occupancy rate, and that 98% of rents due were collected. From this, the company reported an EPS of 7 cents per share. While positive, this represents a serious year-over-year decline, mainly attributable to pandemic-related causes.Even though income is down, Regency has maintained its dividend during the health crisis. The company’s most recent payment, which went out in early January, was for 59.5 cents per share – the same as the previous three quarters. Regency has a pattern of raising the dividend for the Q1 distribution, and has a 12-year history of reliable dividend growth. The 2020 dividends annualized to $2.38 and gives a yield of 5.07%.Covering the stock from Compass Point, analyst Floris van Dijkum writes, “[REG] fully covered its 2020 dividend, based on our estimates, and is expected to retain approximately $75 million of cash post dividend in 2021… REG shares appear [to be a] value at the moment. REG trades at a 20% discount to NAV, wider than sector peers… On an implied cap rate spread, REG trades at 1.1% over its warranted cap rate of 5.5%... We recommend that investors capture this relative valuation spread… by swapping exposure into REG.”Showing the extent of his bullishness, van Dijkum upgraded his stance of REG to a Buy, and raised his price target to $54. At current levels, his target implies a one-year upside of 15%. (To watch van Dijkum’s track record, click here)So, that’s Compass Point's view, let’s turn our attention now to rest of the Street: REG's 4 Buys, 1 Hold and 1 Sell coalesce into a Moderate Buy rating. Meanwhile, the average price target stands at $50.75 and implies an 8% upside from the current levels. (See REG stock analysis on TipRanks)Vornado Realty (VNO)Next up, Vornado, is another REIT, with its headquarters in New York City. The company is known for its ownership of high-brow locations in the city, including the Crowne Plaza Hotel and One Penn Plaza. In addition to the properties of which it is full owner, Vornado is also 70% owner of 1260 Avenue of the Americas and San Francisco’s 555 California Street; in each of these cases, the remaining 30% is connected to former President Trump.Those last-named properties are widely viewed as trophy assets, and were up for sale earlier in 2020. They were pulled from the market as the ‘corona recession’ deepened – and high-end real estate became something of a white whale. Both buildings remain valuable, however, in the range of $5 billion. Vornado is expected to either locate new tenants, or resume efforts to sell, later this year.Vornado’s financials fell off sharply in 2020, when the corona crisis hit, but earnings turned positive in Q3. The company reported $53.2 million in net income attributable to common shareholders, or 28 cents per share, which was up from a net loss of $1.04 per share in Q2. The company attributes the year-over-year declines to building closures and lower rent collections due to the ongoing pandemic – but notes that financial results should improve as the city’s economic reopening accelerates.Vornado was forced to reduce its dividend starting in Q3 2020, from 66 cents per common share to 53 cents, but it has maintained the payment since then. The next payout has been declared for February 12. At the current rate, the dividend annualizes to $2.12 and yields a 5.5%. Truist analyst Michael Lewis covers VNO, and he sees the company’s potentialities opening up again now that 2020 is behind us.“We like it better going into 2021 after earnings washed out in 2020… we think the narrative during the back half of this year will be reopening New York and getting it on a pathway to recovery after vaccine distribution,” the analyst noted.Turning to specific buildings, and the income they generate, Lewis wrote, “PENN1 and PENN2 are expected to gradually contribute to growth from 2022-2024 – and the success of 220 Central Park condo sales means the funding is already raised and is sitting in wait to earn a return.”In line with his upbeat outlook, Lewis upgraded VNO from Hold to Buy, and bumped his price target up to $46, implying 24% upside for the coming 12 months. (To watch Lewis’ track record, click here)Looking at the consensus breakdown, analysts are split right down the middle when it comes to VNO. 2 Buys, 2 Holds and 2 Sells add up to a Hold consensus rating. Additionally, the $40.80 average price target implies ~10% upside from current levels. (See VNO stock analysis on TipRanks)Chevron Corporation (CVX)From REITs, we’ll move over to the oil industry. This is another area rich with dividend potential, as Big Petroleum never lacks for customers, when facing headwinds. Those headwinds, in the past year, have included lower demand and lower prices during the COVID-19 recession – but as the coronavirus recedes, vaccines roll out in greater availability, and economies reopen, the price of oil has been rising. Since the end of October, WTI has gained 55% while Brent is up 54%. The gain in oil prices can’t come at a better time for Chevron, whose operations include, among other concerns, 11,000 oil wells in the Texas Permian Basin, Australia’s $43 billion Gorgon Gas Project, and a 40% interest in 13 of Nigeria’s Niger Delta oil concessions. In 2H20, the company’s revenues rebounded from sharp declines in Q2, reaching $23.9 billion in Q3 and $24.8 billion in Q4. Earnings per share are still negative, but are trending back upward.Many oil companies cut back on dividend payments in 2020 – but not Chevron. The oil giant has a 12-year history of keeping up its payments to shareholders, and kept its common share dividend at $1.29 per share through the difficult year. Last month, the company announced its first common-share dividend payment of CY21, also at $1.29. At that rate, the annual payout is $5.16 per share and the yield is 5.9%.To this end, analyst Paul Cheng, of Canada’s Scotiabank, saw fit to upgrade CVX’s rating from Neutral to Outperform (i.e. Buy), while raising the price target to $110 (from $95). This figure suggest a 23% upside from current levels. (To watch Cheng’s track record, click here)“As a result of the shares’ recent sharp underperformance, we think the company’s relative valuation has become compelling. While we don’t think CVX will perform as well as some of the large cap E&Ps… we think they will be a solid outperformer among the super majors and a good long-term holding with a solid management team focused on their cash return business model,” Cheng commented. Overall, Wall Street appears to be sanguine about Big Oil. CVX has 14 recent reviews, breaking down 10 to 4 in favor of the Buys and making the analyst consensus rating a Moderate Buy. The shares are priced at $89 and the $105.08 average price target suggests the stock has room for ~18% growth this year.

The company said that it “will recognize in the fourth quarter a reduction in Net Income of $23 million attributable to estimated severance and other reduction in force related expenses.”In addition, the company announced the appointment of Michael Franco as Vornado’s new CFO. Franco, who will continue to remain the company’s president, will replace Joseph Macnow on Dec. 31. Macnow is stepping down and will remain with the company as a senior advisor. (See VNO stock analysis on TipRanks)Unlike Ferguson, the rest of the Street is sidelined with an analyst consensus of a Hold based on 4 Holds, 2 Buys and 3 Sells. The average analyst price target of $40.38 implies upside potential of about 10.8% to current levels.Related News:Comtech Extends Term Of UHP Takeover Agreement; Street Stays BullishTiffany Shareholders Approve $15.8B LVMH Takeover; Street Says HoldEnghouse Systems Buys Altitude Software; Street is Bullish",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=243db97ac9cff4b42ab2d87522f2f3a6abfad877041ce905f4c2f2e2d665c436
