company,1626167880,Investors Doubling Down on Autodesk’s Digital Twin Platform,69173615,https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?1431727240,ADSK,Nasdaq,"The outbreak of the pandemic led enterprises to realize the importance of cloud computing in an unprecedented manner. Organizations rapidly transitioned to the cloud to adopt remote work for continual flow in their businesses, which might otherwise have been slowed down by the pandemic-induced restrictions. 



That led to a spur in demand for several companies that offer cloud-based applications and tools, as enterprises are now more vigilant of the cloud’s benefits.



Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK) is a global software company that designs software and services used in the architecture, engineering and construction, manufacturing, digital media, and entertainment industries. Amid the increasing adoption of cloud and the company’s transition from a traditional license revenue model to a cloud-based subscription model, it has lately emerged as an industry leader. 



Recently, following the company’s call with investors, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Blair Abernethy reiterated a Buy rating on Autodesk with a price target of $320 (9.6% upside potential).



Abernethy noted that during the call, Autodesk unveiled new details about its SaaS-based Tandem digital twin platform, which has been commercially available, post its successful beta, since February. A digital twin is a digital representation of a physical item. 



“Autodesk Tandem is a cloud-based digital twin technology platform that aims to turn that stat on its head,” said Bob Bray, senior director and general manager, Autodesk Tandem, in a recent press release. “It enables projects to start digital, stay digital, and deliver digital, transforming rich data into business intelligence,” Bray added.



According to the analyst, though the development of digital twins is in an early stage in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, there are some compelling reasons to adopt this technology. (See Autodesk stock chart on TipRanks)



Abernethy believes that through this platform, Autodesk has an opportunity to help owners manage their projects digitally in an efficient manner. Furthermore, the product will support digital transformation initiatives, possibly bringing significant returns on capital to owners.



Abernethy added that Autodesk has near-term opportunities for Tandem in healthcare, data center, water utilities, and campus facilities as well.



Overall, the analyst commented, “We are positive on the long-term opportunity for Autodesk to leverage its strong position in the AEC industry to provide a new level of abstraction, data capture opportunity and value for its customers through Digital Twins.”



On TipRanks, Autodesk is a Strong Buy based on 8 Buy and 2 Hold ratings. The average Autodesk price target of $337 implies upside potential of 15.4% from the current levels. Autodesk shares have increased around 26% over the past year.



According to the new TipRanks’ Risk Factors tool, the Autodesk stock is at risk mainly from two factors: Finance and Corporate risk and Tech and Innovation risk, which contribute 28% and 26%, respectively, to the total risk for the stock. Within the Finance and Corporate risk category, ADSK has 11 risks, details of which can be found on the TipRanks website.

(ADSK) has submitted a non-binding proposal for the acquisition of Altium Limited’s outstanding common shares for AUD$38.5. 



Altium develops software important to electric engineers and printed circuit board designers in creating connected and intelligent products. The proposed acquisition will enhance Autodesk’s strategy of creating a unified design, manufacturing and engineering cloud platform that enables improved productivity and sustainability for clients. 



The proposed acquisition represents a 41.5% premium over the closing price of Altium on June 4, 2021, the day before the announcement of the proposal. Autodesk will finance the transaction through debt and cash. It will be subject to various conditions including unanimous support of Altium’s board, execution of the implantation scheme, and other customary conditions.  (See ADSK stock analysis in TipRanks)



Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss raised ADSK’s price target from $266 to $269, implying a downside of 5.54% to current levels. This was after the company announced accelerated growth in cRPO bookings and billings in Q1, suggesting a return in momentum in the new business. Despite the positive indicators, Autodesk management did not raise FY22’s organic growth projections. That indicates conservatism, with the path towards recovery being short. 



Weiss reiterated a “Hold” rating on ADKS stock indicating, “the main focus was an acceleration in billings and cRPO bookings (recurring revenue + sequential change in cRPO). Billings accelerated to 10% YoY, from -1% in 2H FY21, signaling building momentum in new businesses, particularly given the smaller base of renewals.”



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 9 Buys and 2 Holds. The Autodesk average analyst price target of $338.60 implies 18.9% upside potential to current levels.



ADSK scores a “Perfect 10” on TipRanks’s Smart Score, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.
