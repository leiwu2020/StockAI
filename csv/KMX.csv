(KMX) delivered blowout quarterly results, driven by a substantial demand for used autos and exceptional performance by the company’s growing omni-channel business model. Shares jumped 6.7% to close at $127.40 on June 25. (See CarMax stock chart on TipRanks)



For the first quarter, net earnings stood at $2.63 per share, up from $0.03 year over year, and surpassed the Street's estimate of $1.63 per share.



Net sales climbed 138.4% to $7.70 billion, beating the analysts' estimate of $6.24 billion.



Retail used car sales doubled to 270,799 cars, and Wholesale used car sales grew 186.6% to 181,389 compared to the year-ago period. Retail comparable store sales increased 99.1% year-over-year.



Bill Nash the company’s President and CEO said, “With the most customer-centric experience in our industry, a highly profitable operating and financial model, and significant opportunities to grow our existing businesses and expand across the broader used auto ecosystem, we remain confident in our ability to meet our long-term targets of revenue growth, total unit growth, and market share.""



By fiscal 2026, CarMax targets $33 billion in revenue and 2 million units in sales per year through its Retail and Wholesale channels combined. Additionally, the company expects to grow its 0-10 year old used autos’ market share to more than 5% by the calendar year 2025.



Following the results, Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel assigned a Buy rating to the stock, with a price target of $153 implying 20.1% upside potential from current levels.



Nagel said, “KMX continues to transform its once traditional Retail business into a digitally-driven omni-channel model. As KMX builds out its digital offering, we view it as only a matter of time before the market begins to reward KMX shares more fully for a much more powerful, tech-enabled model.”



With 5 Buys and 2 Holds, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average analyst CarMax price target of $146.40 implies 14.9% upside potential from current levels. Shares gained 43.2% over the past year. 



Also, TipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 90% Bullish on KMX, compared to a sector average of 72%.

The report is expected to provide additional information on the status of U.S. inflation and is also expected to weigh heavily on the Federal Reserve's next policy action.



Ahead of the open, Dow futures had risen 0.3%, while Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures were trading 0.1% higher at the time of writing.



51job Inc (JOBS), Carmax Inc (KMX), Concord Medical Services Holdings Ltd (CCM), Paychex Inc (PAYX), and Quhuo Ltd (QH), are among the companies expected to release their quarterly earnings today.



Torchlight Energy (TRCH) was the most actively traded stock at the time of writing and was looking to open around 6.5% higher. The spike comes as the prices of oil and natural gas, two commodities that underpin the company's core business, edge higher. The bullish momentum could also be attributed to Torchlight Energy emerging as a meme stock on social media in recent days.



Fuwei Films (FFHL) was the biggest gainer at the time of writing, exploding around 65%, on volume of approximately 1 million shares. The spike comes as the manufacturer and distributor of high-quality BOPER plastic films delivered impressive unaudited Q1 results. Net sales for the quarter were up 22.1% to $15.5 million. Net profit more than doubled to $4.8 million.



Condor Hospitality (CDOR) was the biggest loser in pre-market trading, tanking 10.5% at the time of writing. The slide comes just days after the company announced its board of directors is evaluating strategic alternatives aimed at enhancing shareholder value.



BlackBerry (BB) delivered solid first-quarter results that topped analysts' estimates. Revenue came in at $174 million compared to the $171.25 million expected but slid 16% year-on-year. On the other hand, net loss narrowed to $62 million, or $0.11 a share, compared to the $636 million loss reported in the same period last year.



BlackBerry Executive Chairman and CEO said, “This quarter we aligned the business around the two key market opportunities – IoT and Cyber Security. In IoT we are pleased with the strong progress of the auto business, despite global chip shortage headwinds.”Nike (NKE) shares jumped 14% after the footwear and apparel company delivered a blowout fourth quarter. Revenue in the quarter jumped 96% to $12.3 billion, topping the Street's estimates of $11.1 billion. Earnings came in at $0.93 a share compared to a net loss of $0.51 a share reported the same period last year.



NIKE CEO John Donahoe said, “FY21 was a pivotal year for NIKE as we brought our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy to life across the marketplace. Fueled by our momentum, we continue to invest in innovation and our digital leadership to set the foundation for NIKE’s long-term growth.”



FedEx (FDX) also reported strong fourth-quarter and annual results on the back of volume growth and disciplined revenue and portfolio management. Adjusted earnings nearly doubled to $5.01 a share, topping analysts' estimates of $4.99 a share. Revenue was up 30% to $22.56 billion, surpassing Street estimates of $21.51 billion.



Chairman and CEO of FDX Frederick W. Smith said, “We continue to play an important role in global economic recovery and the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines and relief supplies throughout the U.S., Canada and more than 35 other countries. I am optimistic about the future of FedEx as we continue to innovate for our customers and meet strong demand for our global transportation network and capabilities.”



In M&A news, eBay (EBAY) has reached an agreement to offload a majority stake in its Korean Business to Emart. The company is selling an 80.01% stake in G-9, G-Market, and IAC for $3 billion. It will retain a 19.9% stake in the business valued at about $0.8 billion.



eBay CEO Jamie Iannone stated, “This deal brings together two strong e-commerce and retail companies that can unlock tremendous potential in Korea and provide more choice for customers. We believe this move further optimizes our portfolio and creates value for eBay shareholders.”

It's an interesting time for autos, Murphy told CNBC co-host Andrew Sorkin: production has been restrained due to supply shortages and demand has recovered. Murphy's Autos Forecast: Sorkin asked the analyst what company will be the winner in the space five years from now ""You are going to see a lot of the incumbents do really well,"" Murphy said, putting General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) at the top of the list. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) will continue to raise capital and invest for the future, he said. ""I think you will see some of the new entrants do pretty well also."" The Fate Of Used Cars: The industry will need to transition at some point, as internal combustion engines become the past and EVs move from the future into the present, Murphy told CNBC. In terms of used cars, the industry is being professionalized with companies like Carvana Co. (NYSE: CVNA) and CarMax Inc (NYSE: KMX), the analyst said, adding that this makes consumers more comfortable buying used vehicles. Murphy said he expects these companies to persist well into the EV future, which will be ""good for the industry."" 2021 Price Action: General Motors is up 48.75% year-to-date. Tesla is down 1.99% year-to-date. Carvana is up 15.89% year-to-date. CarMax is up 33.74% year-to-date. Image by Sravan Kumar Anirudhan from Pixabay.

Meanwhile, revenues for the quarter missed analysts’ expectations. Shares plunged 7% to close at $123.31 on April 1. CarMax’s (KMX) 4Q earnings dipped 2.3% to $1.27 per share compared to $1.30 reported in the prior-year period but beat analysts’ expectations of $1.26. Net sales and operating revenues of $5.16 billion missed the Street’s estimates of $5.17 billion but advanced 4.1% from the year-ago period. The company’s total used unit sales and unit sales in comparable stores declined 0.9% and 2.3%, respectively, while wholesale units dropped 1.2% year-over-year. Sales were impacted by the delay in tax refunds and severe weather. (See CarMax stock analysis on TipRanks) Additionally, CarMax inked a cash-and-stock deal to acquire Edmunds, an online guide for car shoppers from research to purchase, for an enterprise value of $404 million. In Jan. 2020, CarMax acquired a minority stake in Edmunds by investing $50 million. The company will acquire the remaining shares of Edmunds and the purchase price includes CarMax’s initial investment. CarMax expects the addition of Edmunds’ net income to be immaterial to the company’s earnings in fiscal 2022. CarMax CEO Bill Nash said, “Our partnership to date has proven to be an outstanding combination as we’ve developed innovative products, including an online instant appraisal offer on both edmunds.com and carmax.com. We look forward to collaborating on new products and initiatives leveraging Edmunds’ industry-leading content and technology expertise to serve both CarMax and Edmunds’ customers.” Following the 4Q results, Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $130. Nagel said, “Overall, we look upon underlying trends at KMX and commentary from management as decidedly constructive. We see today’s modest pullback in KMX shares as reactive in nature and as making for a buying opportunity.” CarMax shares have exploded 145.6% over the past year, while the stock still scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 4 Buys versus 1 Hold. That’s alongside an average analyst price target of $135 which implies 9.5% upside potential from current levels. Furthermore, TipRanks’ Stock Investors tool shows that investors currently have a Very Positive stance on CarMax, with 3.1% of investors increasing their exposure to KMX stock over the past 30 days.
