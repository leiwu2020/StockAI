With this agreement, Australia Post has become the fifth national postal service to use Western Union for international digital money transfers after France, Italy, Russia, and the U.K.



WU is an American worldwide financial services and communications company and has a 17-year association with Australia Post that started with the launch of retail services in 2004.  



Western Union Global Network President Jean Claude Farah said, “With expansion of our relationship with Australia Post, we are continuing our recent momentum powering retail players to succeed in the digital space and unlock new growth opportunities so that together we can serve as an economic force for our global customers.” (See Western Union stock analysis on TipRanks)



Farah added, “Western Union has a distinct vantage point on the diverse money movement needs of our global customers across different continents and economic, financial, and technological ecosystems. Our global platform transcends these complexities, making it possible to send funds easily and quickly across borders and currencies with a few clicks.”



Last month, Northland Securities analyst Michael Grondahl reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $32 (29.2% upside potential).



Commenting on the company’s Q1 results, Grondahl said, “For the rest of 2021, WU is focusing on adding additional third-party relationships and multiple partners in its markets, agent optimization, upgrading and modernizing technology.”



Based on 3 Buys, 4 Holds, and 2 Sells, consensus among analysts is a Hold. The WU average analyst price target of $26.78 implies 8.1% upside potential.



Shares of the company have gained 10.1% over the past year.

The retailer has teamed up with payment giant Western Union to make it easy for customers to transfer funds across the U.S. and to more than 200 countries. In January of this year, the two companies announced this planned agreement, which they are now launching. “Being able to send much-needed funds to a loved one, especially after a year like we’ve had, is more important than ever. We’re proud to extend our commitment to providing choice and value by offering Western Union services to our customers,” said Julia Unger, Vice President of Financial Services at Walmart. Over the years, Walmart has partnered with various financial service providers. Thanks to this partnership with Western Union, Walmart customers will be able to have their funds transferred within minutes across more than 550,000 retail locations or billions of bank accounts worldwide. (See Walmart stock analysis on TipRanks) Following Walmart’s impressive Q1 results boosted by strong discretionary sales, BMO Capital analyst Kelly Bania has reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. Bania stated, “Despite potential for continued upside in 2021, our 2022 EPS is largely unchanged. Longer term, we continue to see meaningful improvements to profitability on Ecommerce, supported in part by WMT's high-margin initiatives.” Bania has a $170 price target on the stock, implying 19.79% upside potential to current levels. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 15 Buy and 4 Hold ratings. The average analyst price target of $167.24 implies 17.9% upside potential to current levels. WMT scores a 3 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, implying it is likely to underperform market expectations.

We’re proud to extend our commitment to providing choice and value by offering Western Union services to our customers,” said Julia Unger, Vice President of Financial Services at Walmart.Over the years, Walmart has partnered with various financial service providers. Thanks to this partnership with Western Union, Walmart customers will be able to have their funds transferred within minutes across more than 550,000 retail locations or billions of bank accounts worldwide.

Western Union also is weighing the creation of a marketplace where consumers can shop, he said.“We think it’s a natural stretch -- people trust us, they trust the Western Union brand,” Agrawal said in the interview. “There’s no reason why we can’t have a broader consumer relationship.”Western Union has seen consumers flock to its website and app after the pandemic temporarily shuttered many of its retail locations around the world last year. The company said Tuesday it’s expecting revenue from its digital remittances business to jump to $1 billion this year, compared with just $600 million before the pandemic.Still, the firm said expenses increased 2% to $977 million, higher than the $953 million average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The firm’s shares fell 3% to $25.09 at 12:10 p.m. in New York, the worst performance in the 75-company S&P 500 Information Technology Index.Western Union now expects earnings per share of $2.06 to $2.16 for the full year, an increase of six cents from an earlier forecast. The increase was partially driven by the sale of Western Union’s investment in Digital Currency Group, a company focused on Bitcoin and blockchain.“That gained a fair amount of value and we thought it was the right time to monetize that,” Agrawal said in a separate interview.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=8e5ccfb42b29dc55b7b8cd3a4df11d3e10995626c20ce6eec2811d1d0f5c567a
