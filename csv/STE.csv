Revenue as reported for the quarter increased 6% to $873.5 million compared with $823.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, with growth in all three segments. Constant currency organic revenue (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures) increased 0.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to constant currency organic revenue results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. For the full fiscal year, revenue as reported increased 3% to $3,107.5 million and constant currency organic revenue was up slightly from the prior year. “We are pleased to finish fiscal 2021 with constant currency organic revenue up slightly from last year and double-digit adjusted net income growth, even with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This performance speaks to the resilience of our business and the good work by our Associates,"" said Walt Rosebrough, President and Chief Executive Officer of STERIS. “Our outlook for fiscal 2022 reflects the additions of Key Surgical for the full year and ten months of Cantel Medical as-well-as another year of record organic revenue and earnings, as we expect healthcare procedure volumes to return to pre-pandemic levels.” Fourth Quarter and Full Year Operating ResultsAs reported, net income for the fourth quarter was $87.4 million or $1.02 per diluted share, compared with $122.6 million or $1.43 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Adjusted net income (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 was $140.3 million or $1.63 per diluted share, compared with the previous year’s fourth quarter of $139.8 million or $1.63 per diluted share. As reported, full year net income was $397.4 million, or $4.63 per diluted share, compared with $407.7 million, or $4.76 per diluted share in fiscal 2020. Adjusted net income for fiscal 2021 was $530.2 million, or $6.17 per diluted share, compared with adjusted net income of $482.7 million, or $5.64 per diluted share in fiscal 2020. The effective tax rate was primarily impacted by discrete item adjustments. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, STERIS eliminated the use of LIFO for inventory accounting, which impacted our quarterly profit measures for fiscal 2021. The impact of this accounting change for fiscal 2021 caused a $0.03 reduction in earnings per diluted share. This accounting change has been retrospectively applied to all periods presented in the attached tables. Fourth Quarter Segment ResultsHealthcare revenue as reported grew 3% in the quarter to $561.8 million compared with $546.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. This performance reflected a 25% increase in consumable revenue, driven by the addition of $32.1 million in revenue from Key Surgical, and a 4% reduction in both service and capital equipment revenue. Constant currency organic revenue declined 4% for the quarter. Healthcare operating income was $122.7 million compared with $120.9 million in last year’s fourth quarter. The increase in profitability was primarily due to the favorable impact from Key Surgical. Fiscal 2021 fourth quarter revenue for Applied Sterilization Technologies increased 15% as reported to $187.5 million compared with $163.7 million in the same period last year. Constant currency organic revenue increased 10%, driven primarily by increased demand from medical device Customers in the quarter. Segment operating income was $88.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 compared with operating income of $72.0 million in the same period last year primarily due to the increased volume, lower expenses and favorable foreign currency impact. Life Sciences fourth quarter revenue as reported grew 10% to $124.2 million compared with $112.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, driven by 43% growth in capital equipment revenue and 5% growth in service revenue which were partially offset by a 4% decline in consumable revenue. Constant currency organic revenue growth was 7% in the quarter. Operating income was $44.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 compared with $41.0 million in the prior year’s fourth quarter primarily driven by increased volume. Cash Flow Net cash provided by operations for fiscal 2021 was $689.6 million, compared with $590.6 million for fiscal 2020. Free cash flow (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures) for fiscal 2021 was $450.9 million compared with $380.2 million in the prior year period. The increase in free cash flow is primarily due to improvements in working capital somewhat offset by higher capital expenditures. Fiscal 2022 OutlookWith Cantel Medical planned to close on June 2, STERIS is providing outlook including Cantel Medical for fiscal 2022. STERIS expects as reported revenue of approximately $4.5 billion. Constant currency organic revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 8-9% for fiscal 2022. Reflecting March 31, 2021 forward rates, currency movements are anticipated to be favorable to revenue by approximately $15 million for fiscal 2022. Adjusted earnings per diluted share are anticipated to be in the range of $7.40 - $7.65, which assumes an adjusted effective tax rate of 21-22% and a share count of approximately 99 million diluted shares. Free cash flow for fiscal 2022 is expected to be approximately $380 million, reflecting approximately $200 million in integration and deal related costs primarily for the purchase of Cantel Medical. Capital spending is anticipated to be approximately $320 million for the combined company. Dividend AnnouncementSTERIS’s Board of Directors has approved a quarterly interim dividend of $0.40 per share. The dividend is payable June 25, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 28, 2021.

Non-GAAP financial measures are presented in this release with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision making. These amounts are disclosed so that the reader has the same financial data that management uses with the belief that it will assist investors and other readers in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our operations for the periods presented. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered along with our GAAP financial measures, provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. Adjusted net income excludes the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations, acquisition related transaction costs, integration costs related to acquisitions, redomiciliation and tax restructuring costs, COVID-19 incremental costs, settlement of I.R.S. adjustments related to prior fiscal years, and certain other unusual or non-recurring items. COVID-19 incremental costs includes the additional costs attributable to COVID-19 such as enhanced cleaning protocols, personal protective equipment for our employees, event cancellation fees, and payroll costs associated with our response to COVID-19, net of any government subsidies available. STERIS believes this measure is useful because it excludes items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provides a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. The Company defines free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property, plant, equipment and intangibles, plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles. STERIS believes that free cash flow is a useful measure of the Company’s ability to fund future principal debt repayments and growth outside of core operations, pay cash dividends, and repurchase ordinary shares. To measure the percentage organic revenue growth, the Company removes the impact of significant acquisitions and divestitures that affect the comparability and trends in revenue. To measure the percentage constant currency organic revenue growth, the impact of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions and divestitures that affect the comparability and trends in revenue are removed. The impact of changes in currency exchange rates is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average currency exchange rates. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales, gross profit, operating income, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company’s operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures below, provide a more complete understanding of the business. The Company strongly encourages investors and shareholders to review its financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

The Company expects to report that revenue as reported for fiscal 2021 increased approximately 3% to $3.1 billion compared with $3.0 billion in fiscal 2020. Constant currency organic revenue was slightly higher than fiscal 2020. STERIS anticipates as reported income from operations for fiscal 2021 to be approximately $548 million and adjusted income from operations to be approximately $699 million. Free cash flow is anticipated to be approximately $447 million for fiscal 2021. “STERIS is announcing certain financial results today so that all investors have access to information regarding the Company’s most recent financial performance prior to the Cantel Medical shareholder vote scheduled for April 29th,” said Walt Rosebrough, STERIS President and CEO. “Given the impact of COVID-19, we are pleased with our fiscal 2021 performance and will be providing more complete results and commentary on our earnings call on May 19, 2021. We also intend to include our outlook for the combined company for fiscal 2022 at that time.” Pending the Cantel Medical shareholder vote and the satisfaction or waiver of other closing conditions, STERIS management now anticipates completing the acquisition of Cantel Medical by June 2, 2021. All applicable regulatory waiting periods have expired or been terminated, and all required pre-closing regulatory approvals or clearances have been obtained. Income tax calculations are in process, and the Company expects the effective tax rate to be in the range of 19-20%. These preliminary and estimated results of operations are based on management’s initial review of operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 and remain subject to completion of the Company’s customary closing and review procedures and final adjustments and other developments that may arise between now and the time the financial results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 are finalized. It is possible that the final reported results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 may differ materially from the information provided in this release.

Non-GAAP financial measures are presented in this release with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision making. These amounts are disclosed so that the reader has the same financial data that management uses with the belief that it will assist investors and other readers in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our operations for the periods presented. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered along with our GAAP financial measures, provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. Adjusted net income excludes the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations, acquisition related transaction costs, integration costs related to acquisitions, redomiciliation and tax restructuring costs, COVID-19 incremental costs, and certain other unusual or non-recurring items. COVID-19 incremental costs include the additional costs attributable to COVID-19 such as enhanced cleaning protocols, personal protective equipment for our employees, event cancellation fees, and payroll costs associated with our response to COVID-19, net of any government subsidies available. STERIS believes this measure is useful because it excludes items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provides a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. The Company defines free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property, plant, equipment and intangibles, plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles. STERIS believes that free cash flow is a useful measure of the Company’s ability to fund future principal debt repayments and growth outside of core operations, pay cash dividends, and repurchase ordinary shares. To measure the percentage organic revenue growth, the Company removes the impact of significant acquisitions and divestitures that affect the comparability and trends in revenue. To measure the percentage constant currency organic revenue growth, the impact of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions and divestitures that affect the comparability and trends in revenue are removed. The impact of changes in currency exchange rates is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average currency exchange rates. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales, gross profit, operating income, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company’s operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures below, provide a more complete understanding of the business. The Company strongly encourages investors and shareholders to review its financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

company,1614006786,Understanding Steris's Ex-Dividend Date,66342338,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,STE,Yahoo,"On February 2, 2021, Steris (NYSE:STE) declared a dividend payable on March 25, 2021 to its shareholders. Steris also announced that shareholders on the company's books on or before February 24, 2021 are entitled to the dividend. The stock will then go ex-dividend 1 business day(s) before the record date. The ex-dividend date for Steris is set for February 23, 2021. The company's current dividend payout sits at $0.4, equating to a dividend yield of 0.86% at current price levels. The Significance Of Ex-Dividend Dates Ex-dividend dates signal when company shares cease to trade with their current dividend payouts. There is a small intermission period before companies announce new dividends. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Most ex-dividend dates operate on a quarterly basis. Steris's Dividend History Over the past year, Steris has experienced an overall upward trend regarding its dividend payouts and a downward trend regarding its yields. Last year on February 24, 2020 the company's payout was $0.37, which has since grown by $0.03. Steris's dividend yield last year was 0.97%, which has since decreased by 0.11%. Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market. Click here to find details on Steris's previous dividends.

Mr. Rosebrough will remain as CEO Emeritus and Senior Advisor to STERIS’s leadership and Board for the next two years. STERIS’s Board of Directors has unanimously appointed Dan Carestio, currently Chief Operating Officer (COO), to the Board of Directors as of January 29, 2021 and Mr. Carestio will succeed Mr. Rosebrough as President and CEO, effective July 29, 2021. The board intends to include Mr. Carestio on the slate of Directors for election at the upcoming Annual General Meeting, and Mr. Rosebrough has advised the Board that he does not intend to stand for re-election. “I believe that STERIS is stronger and better positioned than ever and has a very talented overall leadership team in place to continue to drive forward,” said Walt Rosebrough, President and CEO. “Dan has been with STERIS over twenty years with progressively increasing responsibilities in marketing, sales, and general management. He drove our improvements in Life Sciences and Applied Sterilization Technologies (AST) segments the past decade. He led the successful integration of the Synergy Health AST business, took on the additional leadership of our Healthcare IPT business when that leader retired, and finally became responsible for all our operations as COO in 2018. The success of all three of our business segments since he became COO is a testament to Dan and the STERIS leadership team. I am extremely confident that Dan is the right person to lead STERIS into the future.” “This announcement follows a well-planned and thoughtful succession process, which prioritizes developing leaders from within the Company,” said Dr. Mohsen Sohi, Chairman of the Board. “Dan has a long history of demonstrating his ability to lead and drive results, and the Board has full confidence in him as the next CEO for STERIS. We are fortunate to have had Walt’s leadership for well over a decade, through some of the most challenging times in STERIS’s history. During Walt’s tenure, we have grown revenue three-fold, completed close to fifty acquisitions, added more than 8,000 people to our workforce and grown shareholder value nearly 10 times, adding over $14 billion of market capitalization. We are forever grateful for his contributions and look forward to continuing to have access to his counsel and expertise as an advisor to the Board and senior management for the next two years.” About STERIS STERIS’s MISSION IS TO HELP OUR CUSTOMERS CREATE A HEALTHIER AND SAFER WORLD by providing innovative healthcare and life science product and service solutions around the globe.

company,1612301400,STERIS Announces Financial Results for Fiscal 2021 Third Quarter,66342369,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/stEjqDh7dnp1Yijk32o0SQ--~B/aD0xMDQ7dz02NDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/globenewswire.com/cc405ff611499758e28ea7ead3725cd2,STE,Yahoo,"Third quarter revenue increases 4% as reported; 1% constant currency organic Third quarter earnings per diluted share increase to $1.33 on a U.S. GAAP basis and $1.73 on an adjusted basisIncreased free cash flow driven by net income growth and working capital improvements DUBLIN, IRELAND , Feb. 02, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- STERIS plc (NYSE: STE) (“STERIS” or the “Company”) today announced financial results for its fiscal 2021 third quarter ended December 31, 2020. Revenue as reported for the quarter increased 4% to $808.9 million compared with $774.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, with growth in all three segments. Constant currency organic revenue (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures) increased 1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to strong constant currency organic revenue results in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. “We continue to be impressed by the resilience of our business and the good work by STERIS Associates,” said Walt Rosebrough, President and Chief Executive Officer of STERIS. “In our third quarter, Healthcare capital equipment orders continued their sequential improvement, resulting in near record backlog at the end of December. As anticipated, Life Sciences consumable Customers appear to have worked through inventory, resulting in a return to more normalized revenue growth rates, and AST continues its path of strong growth. We are well positioned to finish another record year in revenue and income during fiscal 2021 and look forward to welcoming Cantel Medical to the STERIS family in fiscal 2022.” As reported, net income for the third quarter increased to $114.5 million or $1.33 per diluted share, compared with $104.9 million, or $1.23 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Adjusted net income (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures) for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 increased to $149.2 million, or $1.73 per diluted share, compared with the previous year’s third quarter of $124.0 million or $1.45 per diluted share. Third Quarter Segment ResultsHealthcare revenue as reported grew 2% in the quarter to $521.7 million compared with $509.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. This performance reflected a 14% increase in consumable revenue, in part benefiting from $15.5 million in revenue from Key Surgical, and 1% growth in service revenue offset by a 5% decline in capital equipment revenue. Constant currency organic revenue declined 1% during the quarter. Healthcare operating income was $115.4 million compared with $105.2 million in last year’s third quarter. The increase in profitability was primarily due to lower operating expenses due to business disruption from COVID-19 and the favorable impact from Key Surgical. Fiscal 2021 third quarter revenue for Applied Sterilization Technologies increased 13% as reported to $176.5 million compared with $156.3 million in the same period last year. Constant currency organic revenue increased 10%, driven primarily by increased demand from medical device Customers in the quarter. Segment operating income was $81.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 compared with operating income of $65.5 million in the same period last year primarily due to the increased volume, lower operating expenses and favorable foreign currency impact. Life Sciences third quarter revenue as reported grew 2% to $110.8 million compared with $108.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, driven by 7% growth in consumable revenue and 5% growth in service revenue offset by a 9% decline in capital equipment revenue. While capital equipment shipments declined compared with the prior year period, orders remained strong and backlog ended the quarter at record levels. Constant currency organic revenue was flat in the quarter. Operating income was $41.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 compared with $37.7 million in the prior year’s third quarter, primarily driven by revenue mix and lower operating expenses. Cash Flow Net cash provided by operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2021 was $501.8 million, compared with $391.3 million in fiscal 2020. Free cash flow (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures) for the first nine months of fiscal 2021 was $337.7 million compared with $238.1 million in the prior year period. The increase in free cash flow is primarily due to increases in net income and working capital improvements somewhat offset by higher capital expenditures. Dividend AnnouncementSTERIS’s Board of Directors has approved a quarterly interim dividend of $0.40 per share. The dividend is payable March 25, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 24, 2021.

Non-GAAP financial measures are presented in this release with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision making. These amounts are disclosed so that the reader has the same financial data that management uses with the belief that it will assist investors and other readers in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our operations for the periods presented. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered along with our GAAP financial measures, provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. Adjusted net income excludes the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations, acquisition related transaction costs, integration costs related to acquisitions, redomiciliation and tax restructuring costs, COVID-19 incremental costs, and certain other unusual or non-recurring items. COVID-19 incremental costs includes the additional costs attributable to COVID-19 such as enhanced cleaning protocols, personal protective equipment for our employees, event cancellation fees, and payroll costs associated with our response to COVID-19, net of any government subsidies available. STERIS believes this measure is useful because it excludes items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provides a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. The Company defines free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property, plant, equipment and intangibles, plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles. STERIS believes that free cash flow is a useful measure of the Company’s ability to fund future principal debt repayments and growth outside of core operations, pay cash dividends, and repurchase ordinary shares. To measure the percentage organic revenue growth, the Company removes the impact of significant acquisitions and divestitures that affect the comparability and trends in revenue. To measure the percentage constant currency organic revenue growth, the impact of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions and divestitures that affect the comparability and trends in revenue are removed. The impact of changes in currency exchange rates is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average currency exchange rates. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales, gross profit, operating income, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company’s operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures below, provide a more complete understanding of the business. The Company strongly encourages investors and shareholders to review its financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

Cantel stockholders will get about $16.93 in cash and 0.33787 of a Steris ordinary share for each Cantel share they own. Cantel shares closed at $83.87 on Jan. 12. The deal translates into a total enterprise value of about $4.6 billion, including Cantel’s net debt and convertible notes. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies.Cantel (CMD) is a global provider of infection prevention products and services primarily to endoscopy and dental customers. Meanwhile, Steris sells sterilization equipment, surgical tables and other products to hospitals and laboratories.Steris intends to fund the cash portion of the deal and repay a significant amount of Cantel’s existing debt with $2 billion of new debt for which it has secured bridge financing.  The transaction is expected to close by the end of June 30, subject to regulatory approvals and the approval by Cantel shareholders. “We have long appreciated Cantel, which is a natural complement and extension to Steris’ product and service offerings, global reach and customers,” said Steris CEO Walt Rosebrough. “Our companies share a similar focus on infection prevention across a range of healthcare customers.  Combined, we will offer a broader set of customers a more diversified selection of infection prevention and procedural products and services. We firmly believe we will create greater value for our customers and shareholders together.”Additionally, the companies expect to generate $110 million in annualized pre-tax cost synergies by the fourth fiscal year following the close, with approximately 50% achieved in the first two years. Cost synergies are expected to be primarily driven by cost reductions in redundant public company and back-office overhead, commercial integration, product manufacturing, and service operations.Oppenheimer analyst Michael Matson believes that the deal makes both strategic and financial sense. However, he reiterated a Hold rating on STE, adding that shares should trade in line with its current P/E multiple of ~27x his CY 2022E EPS estimate.“The deal allows STE to significantly expand its gastrointestinal (GI) presence and to expand into the adjacent dental market,” Matson wrote in a note to investors. “The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increased focus on infection prevention, which we expect to serve as a tailwind for CMD's business over the longer-term.” The analyst estimates the acquisition could drive adjusted EPS accretion of ~7% in CY22, ~10% in CY23, and ~11% in CY24.
