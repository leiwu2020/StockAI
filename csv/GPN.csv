A decade or so later, the second business they founded is now worth $95 billion, making it the most valuable U.S. startup.The latest valuation for Stripe Inc., their online payments processing firm, gives John, 30, and Patrick, 32, a net worth of about $11.5 billion each, putting the two brothers among the richest self-made millennial billionaires in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.The valuation figure is at the top of the range Bloomberg News reported in November, when Stripe was in talks with investors. At the time, discussions were for a value of more than $70 billion with the possibility of pushing it as high as $100 billion.Its current valuation puts it ahead of billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Instacart Inc., according to CBInsights data, and surpasses the market value of publicly traded rivals including Adyen NV, Global Payments Inc. and Fiserv Inc.The Irish brothers founded Stripe in 2010 after dropping out of college in the U.S. They were previously worth $4.3 billion, according to the wealth index.Snap Inc. founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, as well as China’s Wang Ning are the only other self-made billionaires under the age of 35 among the world’s 500 richest, while U.K. aristocrat Hugh Grosvenor and Walmart Inc. heir Lukas Walton hold the sole inherited fortunes in the group.Stripe, which sells software allowing businesses to accept online payments, has been a beneficiary of the e-commerce boom accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic. The company plans to invest in its European operations, in particular its headquarters in Dublin, to support surging demand and expand its global payments and treasury network, the company said Sunday in a statement.The firm also has a headquarters in San Francisco, according to its website, and counts Baillie Gifford, Fidelity Management & Research and Sequoia Capital among its investors.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ea23d12f0a2689d2820b8c94b91ca6b1c3343583d0d9eaf29c85875950780b8c

But don’t count out those pursuing targets in other industries, such as Foley Trasimene Acquisition II (NYSE:BFT) stock. Source: Sulastri Sulastri / Shutterstock.com This SPAC’s sponsor, Bill Foley, may not have the clout of the most well-known “SPAC Impresario,” Chamath Palihapitiya. But Foley is fast becoming one of the more prolific SPAC sponsors out there. As InvestorPlace columnist David Moadel wrote in his Feb. 22 column, Trasimene Acquisition II is Foley’s fourth SPAC. The first one (CF Corp) bought Fidelity & Guaranty Life, before getting acquired by Fidelity National Financial (NYSE:FIS), a company with which Foley was already involved.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Another one, Foley Trasimene Acquisition II, has announced a merger partner: payments processor Paysafe. More important than Foley’s background is whether BFT stock can continue to climb once the Paysafe deal closes. After examining the details, I think that the shares can rise in the years ahead. BFT stock is worth buying today, but keep the risks it carries in mind. The “SPAC bubble” may be about to pop, resulting in some near-term volatility in the shares. BFT Stock and the Paysafe Deal Whenever assessing a SPAC stock that’s announced a deal, your first question should be whether the deal terms make the shares worth investing in. To determine whether BFT stock is attractive, let’s examine the details of its deal. 8 Stocks to Buy for March First, let’s look at the overview of the transaction . At today’s prices, the combined entity is valued at around $11.3 billion. Combined with the $1.8 billion of post-deal debt, the implied enterprise value of the shares is around $13.7 billion. Paysafe is expecting sales of around $1.5 billion and EBITDA of $561 million this year. In short, today’s share price implies an EV/EBITDA ratio of around 25 times. That valuation is on par with that of similar companies, like Global Payments (NYSE:GPN). Also, Paysafe expects its EBITDA to reach $669 million to $744 million by 2023, around 20%-30% above its 2021 target. That suggests that BFT stock can gain 20%-30% in the coming years. The share price probably won’t double or triple like a number of other SPACS have. But it could appreciate reasonably in the coming years. This SPAC’s Risks On the other hand, there are several reasons why going long BFT stock today may not be profitable. Firstly, the valuation of payment processing plays could contract. Right now, the rapid growth of the online sports gambling market in the U.S. is helping to justify the high valuations of payment processors But if future years bring lower-than-expected growth for online sports gambling companies and iGaming operators, it may be tough for stocks like Paysafe to keep trading at their current EBITDA multiples. Secondly, the “SPAC Bubble” may be about to burst. That could push many blank-check stocks, including ones that have already announced deals, back towards their offering prices or even lower. While there’s little investors can do about the first risk, the second one may have a silver lining. If the market gets skittish about SPACs and sells blank check stocks across the board, you may be able to take advantage of the situation and buy BFT stock at a more favorable entry point. The Bottom Line I don’t see this SPAC becoming a “meme stock” anytime soon. But, because it’s reasonably priced, it may be a solid opportunity for long-term investors. Indeed, the shares could continue to climb, assuming the online gambling industry keeps expanding in the U.S. The risks posed by the name are more general to blank-check stocks, rather than company-specific issues. All in all, consider BFT stock a buy. On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not (either directly or indirectly) hold any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Global Payments has. Global Payments's Debt Based on Global Payments's balance sheet as of October 29, 2020, long-term debt is at $8.44 billion and current debt is at $1.27 billion, amounting to $9.71 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $2.22 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $7.49 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Global Payments's $44.55 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.22. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Why Shareholders Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.
