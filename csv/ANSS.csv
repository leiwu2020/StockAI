(ANSS) has acquired Phoenix Integration Inc. Phoenix provides software for model-based engineering (MBE) and model-based systems engineering (MBSE). Terms of the deal are undisclosed, but the acquisition is not expected to significantly impact Ansys’ consolidated financial statements in 2021. Ansys Senior Vice President Shane Emswiler said, “Companies across industries are benefitting from process integration and MBSE through improved communications, increased product quality, and heightened productivity across their engineering teams.” (See Ansys stock analysis on TipRanks) Emswiler added, “Acquiring market leader Phoenix integration will complement our acquisition of Dynardo in the process integration and design optimization space, and expand our capabilities providing customers with strong MBE and MBSE offerings to further our pervasive engineering strategy.” The addition of Phoenix integration will improve the usability of Ansys’ solutions, helping engineers and designers to connect a wider range of tools in the product development process. Software tools are often not connected, so changes have to be made manually, making them hard to trace. With the new MBE capabilities, more of Ansys’ processes will be automated. On May 7, RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg reiterated a Hold rating on the stock but lowered the price target to $360 (12.1% upside potential) from $380 on account of peer multiple contractions. Hedberg noted that Ansys’ recent Q1 performance was driven by higher software license revenue, and the analyst expects an improving environment for the company. Consensus among analysts is that Ansys is a Moderate Buy based on 4 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $365 implies 13.6% upside potential.

For the first quarter of 2021, the Company reported diluted earnings per share of $0.82 and $1.12 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively, compared to $0.53 and $0.83 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively, for the first quarter of 2020. “Ansys achieved excellent results for the first quarter, delivering double-digit revenue and earnings growth.

The 2021 and 2020 non-GAAP results exclude the income statement effects of the acquisition accounting adjustments to deferred revenue, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and transaction expenses related to business combinations. GAAP and non-GAAP results are as follows: GAAP Non-GAAP(in millions, except percentages and per share data)Q1 2021 Q1 2020 % Change Q1 2021 Q1 2020 % ChangeRevenue$363.2 $305.0 19% $372.1 $308.9 20%Net income$72.4 $46.1 57% $98.9 $72.3 37%Diluted earnings per share$0.82 $0.53 55% $1.12 $0.83 35%Operating profit margin13.8% 11.2% 33.5% 29.3% The non-GAAP financial results highlighted above, and the non-GAAP financial outlook for 2021 discussed below, represent non-GAAP financial measures.

There is no GAAP measure comparable to ACV. ACV is composed of the following: the annualized value of maintenance and lease contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plusthe value of perpetual license contracts with start dates during the period, plusthe annualized value of fixed-term services contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plusthe value of work performed during the period on fixed-deliverable services contracts. / Management's 2021 Financial Outlook The Company's second quarter and fiscal year 2021 revenue and diluted earnings per share guidance is provided below. The Company is also providing its fiscal year 2021 guidance for ACV and operating cash flows. The revenue and diluted earnings per share guidance is provided on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the income statement effects of acquisition adjustments to deferred revenue, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related transaction expenses. The financial guidance below reflects the Company's current estimates of the adverse impacts of the global pandemic and trade restrictions. This guidance is based on the Company's evaluation of factual information it has determined to be relevant and the application of certain assumptions made by the Company. Please refer to the Company's prepared remarks document for essential additional information regarding the Company's financial guidance, including its assumptions regarding overall business dynamics and the economic impacts of COVID-19 and trade restrictions. / Second Quarter 2021 Guidance The Company currently expects the following for the quarter ending June 30, 2021: (in millions, except per share data)GAAP Non-GAAPRevenue$409.7 - $439.7 $415.0 - $445.0Diluted earnings per share$0.82 - $1.10 $1.43 - $1.67 / Fiscal Year 2021 Guidance The Company currently expects the following for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021: (in millions, except per share data)GAAP Non-GAAPRevenue$1,790.7 - $1,855.7 $1,810.0 - $1,875.0Diluted earnings per share$4.62 - $5.16 $6.69 - $7.10 The difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance presented above is a result of the expected impact of the application of the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations in the amount of $5.3 million for the second quarter and $19.3 million for FY 2021. The FY 2021 revenue and ACV guidance assumes an incremental headwind of approximately $14 million from currency relative to our guidance initiated in February. This currency headwind had an approximately $0.06 per share impact on FY 2021 earnings per share guidance and an approximately $5 million impact on FY 2021 operating cash flow guidance. The Q2 and FY 2021 earnings per share guidance includes a gain of approximately $15.1 million, or $0.14 per share, related to a change in the value of an equity investment. This gain will not affect the Company’s revenue, operating income or cash flows.

These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. A detailed explanation of each of the adjustments to such financial measures is described below. This press release also contains a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable GAAP financial measure. We use non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to our competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and spending budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting, (e) to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and (f) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and employees. In addition, many financial analysts that follow us focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that it is in the best interest of our investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the non-GAAP financial information. Moreover, investors have historically requested, and we have historically reported, these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all our competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of our competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures. The adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below: Acquisition accounting for deferred revenue. Historically, we have consummated acquisitions in order to support our strategic and other business objectives. In accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value. Although this acquisition accounting requirement has no impact on our business or cash flow, it adversely impacts our reported GAAP revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition. In order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results, we provide non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment. We believe that this non-GAAP financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare our past and future reports of financial results as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods. Amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions. We incur amortization of intangible assets, included in our GAAP presentation of amortization expense, related to various acquisitions we have made. We exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by us after the acquisition. Accordingly, we do not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating our performance during the applicable time period after the acquisition, and we exclude such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare our past reports of financial results as we have historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures. Stock-based compensation expense. We incur expense related to stock-based compensation included in our GAAP presentation of cost of maintenance and service; research and development expense; and selling, general and administrative expense. This non-GAAP adjustment also includes excess payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense (benefit) incurred in connection with our deferred compensation plan held in a rabbi trust includes an offsetting benefit (charge) recorded in other income (expense). Although stock-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, we exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance. We similarly exclude income (expense) related to assets held in a rabbi trust in connection with our deferred compensation plan. Specifically, we exclude stock-based compensation and income (expense) related to assets held in the deferred compensation plan rabbi trust during our annual budgeting process and our quarterly and annual assessments of our performance. The annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby we allocate resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. Additionally, the annual review by our board of directors during which it compares our historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stock-based compensation. In evaluating the performance of our senior management and department managers, charges related to stock-based compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results. In fact, we record stock-based compensation expense into a stand-alone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable. In this way, we can review, on a period-to-period basis, each manager's performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stock-based compensation. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results. Transaction expenses related to business combinations. We incur expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, which are included in our GAAP presentation of selling, general and administrative expense. These expenses are generally not tax-deductible. We exclude these acquisition-related transaction expenses, derived from announced acquisitions, for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance, as we generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of our operations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results. Non-GAAP tax provision. We utilize a normalized non-GAAP annual effective tax rate (AETR) to calculate non-GAAP measures. This methodology provides better consistency across interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring items and aligning the non-GAAP tax rate with our expected geographic earnings mix. To project this rate, we analyzed our historic and projected non-GAAP earnings mix by geography along with other factors such as our current tax structure, recurring tax credits and incentives, and expected tax positions. On an annual basis we will re-evaluate this rate for significant items that may materially affect our projections. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as listed below: GAAP Reporting MeasureNon-GAAP Reporting MeasureRevenueNon-GAAP RevenueGross ProfitNon-GAAP Gross ProfitGross Profit MarginNon-GAAP Gross Profit MarginOperating IncomeNon-GAAP Operating IncomeOperating Profit MarginNon-GAAP Operating Profit MarginNet IncomeNon-GAAP Net IncomeDiluted Earnings Per ShareNon-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share / About Ansys If you've ever seen a rocket launch, flown on an airplane, driven a car, used a computer, touched a mobile device, crossed a bridge or put on wearable technology, chances are you've used a product where Ansys software played a critical role in its creation.

Velodyne’s leading-edge automotive lidar greatly increases the safety and reliability of ADA, powering highly intelligent AVs that improve decision making across many complex edge case scenarios.” Banerjee added, “Using VRXPERIENCE, OEMs will validate the lidar’s software stack and have full access to a validated sensor model while preserving Velodyne’s IP.” (See Ansys stock analysis on TipRanks) Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) need to test and recognize edge case scenarios. Lidar technology locates and tracks objects across different situations, but to be validated, extensive physical testing is required, increasing the development cost of the system.
