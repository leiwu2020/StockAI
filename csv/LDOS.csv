The company will merge with Leidos' maritime systems division, where it will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary. With the acquisition, the science and technology company gains access to an independent ship design company. Gibbs & Cox will provide Leidos with experienced designers and engineers specializing in the design and development of naval vessels. It will also position Leidos as a leading provider of engineering solutions to the U.S. Navy and foreign navies. “Gibbs & Cox will remain the nation’s largest independent provider of maritime services. The combination of our world-class naval architecture, design and engineering services with Leidos’ speed, security and scale will significantly enhance our combined offerings in the fast growing maritime undersea, autonomous and cyber security segments,” said Chris Deegan, Gibbs & Cox CEO. The acquisition of Gibbs & Cox, first announced in February, comes on the heels of Leidos reporting impressive Q1 financial results. Revenues were up 14.7% year-over-year to $3.32 billion. Operating income was up 60.4% compared to Q1 2020, to $308 million. Diluted EPS of $1.42 was reported during the quarter, vs. $0.80 in the comparable quarter of 2019. In line with its robust results, the company has increased its non-GAAP EPS guidance to between $6.35 and $6.65 for full-year 2021. (See Leidos stock analysis on TipRanks) Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi has since reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. According to the analyst, Leidos has been able to obscure the factors hindering its progress recently, such as COVID-19 and softness from its flagging airport business. DeNardi stated, “We believe Leidos has the best visibility into revenue growth over the next ~12-24 months and believes this bodes well for valuation and current risk/reward.” He continued, ""We like Leidos' positioning in a tougher budget environment, its ability to benefit from a re-opening through its airport business, and its recent track record of gaining share and winning large pursuits."" The analyst has since reiterated a $115 price target, implying 10.55% upside potential to current levels. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 9 Buy and 1 Hold ratings. The average analyst price target of $114.78 implies 10.33% upside potential to current levels. LDOS scores an 8 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating tool, implying it is likely to outperform the overall market.

(NYSE: LDOS) (“Leidos”) on behalf of those who purchased or acquired Leidos securities between May 4, 2020 and February 23, 2021, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investor Deadline Reminder: Investors who purchased or acquired Leidos securities during the Class Period may, no later than May 5, 2021, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. For additional information or to learn how to participate in this litigation please contact Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP: James Maro, Esq. (484) 270-1453 or Adrienne Bell, Esq. (484) 270-1435; toll free at (844) 887-9500; via e-mail at info@ktmc.com; or click https://www.ktmc.com/leidos-holdings-class-action-lawsuit?utm_source=PR&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=leidos Leidos is a science, engineering, and information technology company that provides services and solutions in the defense, intelligence, homeland security, civil and health markets, both domestically and internationally. The Class Period commences on May 4, 2020, when Leidos announced that it had completed the acquisition of L3Harris Technologies’ Security Detection and Automation businesses (“SD&A Businesses”). According to the complaint, on February 16, 2021, Spruce Point Capital Management LLC (“Spruce Point”) published a research report, alleging, among other things that “Leidos is potentially covering up at least $100m of fictitious sales, mischaracterizing $355 - $367m of international revenue.” The report also alleged that Leidos was “concealing numerous product defects from investors, notably faulty explosive detection systems at airports and borders.” Following this news, Leidos’s share price fell $2.58, or 2.4%, to close at $105.22 per share on February 16, 2021. Then, on February 23, 2021, Leidos announced its fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results in a press release. Therein, Leidos reported $89 million in revenue related to the SD&A Businesses for the fourth quarter, meaning that after two full quarters, the acquisition generated only $163 million in sales (or $326 million annualized), falling well short of projected $500 million sales. Leidos expected cash flow of $850 million, well below analyst estimates of $1.083 billion. Following this news, Leidos’s stock price fell $10.29, or 9.91%, to close at $93.51 per share on February 23, 2021. Finally, on February 24, 2021, Spruce Point highlighted that Leidos had “materially expanded” the risk disclosures in its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2020, which had been filed after the market closed on February 23, 2021. Spruce Point tweeted: “We believe it is validating all the major points of our report.” Spruce Point noted that Leidos expanded its risk disclosures regarding insurance coverage, as “Liedos is shipping defective products back from various countries [that] may not have the same protections as in the U.S.” Following this news, Leidos’s stock price fell $3.13, or 3.3%, to close at $90.38 per share on February 24, 2021. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, the defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the purported benefits of Leidos’s acquisition of L3Harris Technologies’ SD&A Businesses were significantly overstated; (2) Leidos’s products suffered from numerous product defects, including faulty explosive detection systems at airports, ports, and borders; (3) as a result of the foregoing, Leidos’s financial results were significantly overstated; and (4) as a result of the foregoing, the defendants’ positive statements about Leidos’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. Leidos investors may, no later than May 5, 2021, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed as a lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member’s claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff.

(“Leidos” or the “Company”) (NYSE: LDOS). Such investors are advised to contact Robert S. Willoughby at newaction@pomlaw.com or 888-476-6529, ext. 7980. The investigation concerns whether Leidos and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. [Click here for information about joining the class action] In May 2020, Leidos acquired the Security Detection and Automation (“SD&A”) business of L3 Harris Technologies for $1 billion, representing to Company investors that the highly leveraged deal would help Leidos achieve double-digit growth, 15% margins, $500 million in revenues, and boost international sales. Then, on February 16, 2021, Spruce Point Capital Management (“Spruce Point”) published a report concluding that Leidos had “wasted” $1 billion on the SD&A acquisition. The Spruce Point report alleges that Leidos is “potentially covering up at least $100m of fictitious sales, mischaracterizing $355 - $367m of international revenue” and that also “concealing numerous product defects from investors, including faulty explosive detection systems at airports, ports and borders.” The Spruce Point report further asserts that the Company’s management may be intentionally inflating certain of Leidos’ financial metrics, including operating cash flow and organic sales growth, to obscure strains from investors. For the foregoing reasons, among others, Spruce Point “an immediate Board investigation into the SD&A transaction and the dismissal of CEO [Roger A.] Krone and CFO [James C.] Reagan.” Following publication of the Spruce Point report, Leidos’s stock price fell sharply, damaging investors. The Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Paris is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 80 years later, the Pomerantz Firm continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomerantzlaw.com. CONTACT:Robert S.

(NYSE: LDOS) securities between May 4, 2020 and February 23, 2021, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until May 3, 2021 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. On February 16, 2021, Spruce Point Capital Management LLC (“Spruce Point”) published a research report, alleging, among other things that “Leidos is potentially covering up at least $100m of fictitious sales, mischaracterizing $355 - $367m of international revenue.” The report also alleged that the Company was “concealing numerous product defects from investors, notably faulty explosive detection systems at airports and borders.” On this news, the Company’s share price fell $2.58, or 2.4%, to close at $105.22 per share on February 16, 2021. On February 23, 2021, Leidos announced its fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results in a press release. Therein, the Company reported $89 million revenue related to the SD&A businesses for the fourth quarter, meaning that after two full quarters, the acquisition generated only $163 million in sales (or $326 million annualized), falling well short of projected $500 million sales. The Company expected cash flow of $850 million, well below analyst estimates of $1.083 billion. On this news, the Company’s stock price fell $10.29, or 9.91%, to close at $93.51 per share on February 23, 2021. On February 24, 2021, Spruce Point highlighted that Leidos had “materially expanded” the risk disclosures in its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2020. Spruce Point tweeted: “We believe it is validating all the major points of our report.” On this news, the Company’s stock price fell $3.13, or 3.3%, to close at $90.38 per share on February 24, 2021. The complaint, filed on March 4, 2021, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that the purported benefits of the Company’s acquisition of L3Harris’ Security Detection & Automation businesses were significantly overstated; (2) that Leidos’ products suffered from numerous product defects, including faulty explosive detection systems at airports, ports, and borders; (3) that, as a result of the foregoing, the Company’s financial results were significantly overstated; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

According to the complaint, on February 16, 2021, Spruce Point Capital Management LLC (“Spruce Point”) published a research report, alleging, among other things that “Leidos is potentially covering up at least $100m of fictitious sales, mischaracterizing $355 - $367m of international revenue.” Following this news, Leidos’s share price fell $2.58, or 2.4%, to close at $105.22 per share on February 16, 2021. Then, on February 24, 2021, Spruce Point highlighted that Leidos had “materially expanded” the risk disclosures in its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2020, which had been filed after the market closed on February 23, 2021. Following this news, Leidos’s stock price fell $3.13, or 3.3%, to close at $90.38 per share on February 24, 2021. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, the defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the purported benefits of Leidos’s acquisition of L3Harris Technologies’ Security Detection and Automation businesses were significantly overstated; (2) Leidos’s products suffered from numerous product defects, including faulty explosive detection systems at airports, ports, and borders; (3) as a result of the foregoing, Leidos’s financial results were significantly overstated; and (4) as a result of the foregoing, the defendants’ positive statements about Leidos’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. Leidos investors may, no later than May 5, 2021, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP, or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed as a lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member’s claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP prosecutes class actions in state and federal courts throughout the country involving securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duties and other violations of state and federal law. Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP is a driving force behind corporate governance reform, and has recovered billions of dollars on behalf of institutional and individual investors from the United States and around the world.

On February 16, 2021, it was reported by Spruce Point Capital Management that “Leidos’ $1.0 billion levered acquisition of L3Harris’ Security Detection and Automation business (SD&A) is experiencing significant problems, including product defects, that increase the likelihood of a material adverse effect.” This report continued to allege that Leidos misstated its revenue, citing, for example, a $6 million variance between the third quarter 2020 investor presentation and a Form 10-Q, which “raises the possibility that Leidos has booked fake revenue, or is keeping two sets of books.” On February 16, 2021, Leidos stock dropped $3.41 per share, or roughly 3%, to close at $105.22 on following this news. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than May 3, 2021.

(NYSE: LDOS) and certain of its executives. If you purchased or acquired shares of Leidos between May 4, 2020 and February 23, 2021, you are strongly encouraged to contact Block & Leviton attorneys at (617) 398-5600, via email at cases@blockleviton.com, or visit our website for information on the case. The deadline to move the Court to be appointed lead plaintiff is May 3, 2021. On February 16, 2021, analyst Spruce Point Capital Management published a report concluding that Leidos had “wasted” $1 billion on its May 2020 acquisition of the Security Detection and Automation business of L3 Harris Technologies. The Spruce Point report further alleged that Leidos is “potentially covering up at least $100m of fictitious sales, mischaracterizing $355 - $367m of international revenue,” and that Leidos is “concealing numerous product defects from investors, including faulty explosive detection systems at airports, ports and borders.” The Spruce Point report further alleged that Leidos’ management may be intentionally inflating certain of Leidos’ financial metrics to obscure strains from investors. Following publication of the Spruce Point report, Leidos’ stock price fell sharply. Then before the markets opened on February 23, 2021, Leidos published a press release announcing its fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results. On this news, Leidos’ shares fell $10.29 each, or approximately 10%. A lawsuit has been filed against Leidos and two of its executives in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit is captioned Morton v. Leidos Holdings, Inc., et al., No. 1:21-cv-019111 (S.D.N.Y.). If you purchased or acquired shares of Leidos between May 4, 2020 and February 23, 2021, you are strongly encouraged to contact Block & Leviton attorneys at (617) 398-5600, via email at cases@blockleviton.com, or visit our website for information on the case.

(“Leidos” or the “Company”) (NYSE: LDOS) securities between May 4, 2020 and February 23, 2021, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Leidos investors have until May 3, 2021 to file a lead plaintiff motion. If you suffered a loss on your Leidos investments or would like to inquire about potentially pursuing claims to recover your loss under the federal securities laws, you can submit your contact information at https://www.glancylaw.com/cases/leidos-holdings-inc.

On February 16, 2021, Spruce Point Capital Management LLC (“Spruce Point”) published a research report, alleging, among other things that “Leidos is potentially covering up at least $100m of fictitious sales, mischaracterizing $355 - $367m of international revenue.” The report also alleged that the Company was “concealing numerous product defects from investors, notably faulty explosive detection systems at airports and borders.” On this news, the Company’s share price fell $2.58, or 2.4%, to close at $105.22 per share on February 16, 2021, on unusually heavy trading volume. On February 23, 2021, Leidos announced its fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results in a press release. Therein, the Company reported $89 million revenue related to the SD&A businesses for the fourth quarter, meaning that after two full quarters, the acquisition generated only $163 million in sales (or $326 million annualized), falling well short of projected $500 million sales. The Company expected cash flow of $850 million, well below analyst estimates of $1.083 billion. On this news, the Company’s stock price fell $10.29, or 9.91%, to close at $93.51 per share on February 23, 2021. On February 24, 2021, Spruce Point highlighted that Leidos had “materially expanded” the risk disclosures in its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2020. Spruce Point tweeted: “We believe it is validating all the major points of our report.” On this news, the Company’s stock price fell $3.13, or 3.3%, to close at $90.38 per share on February 24, 2021, on unusually heavy trading volume. Throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that the purported benefits of the Company’s acquisition of L3Harris’ Security Detection & Automation businesses were significantly overstated; (2) that Leidos’ products suffered from numerous product defects, including faulty explosive detection systems at airports, ports, and borders; (3) that, as a result of the foregoing, the Company’s financial results were significantly overstated; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, the defendants failed to disclose material information to investors. Specifically, the defendants failed to disclose that: (1) the purported benefits of Leidos’s acquisition of L3Harris Technologies’ Security Detection and Automation businesses were significantly overstated; (2) Leidos’s products suffered from numerous product defects, including faulty explosive detection systems at airports, ports, and borders; (3) as a result of the foregoing, Leidos’s financial results were significantly overstated; and (4) as a result of the foregoing, the defendants’ positive statements about Leidos’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. As a result of the foregoing, Leidos securities lost significant value, directly harming Leidos investors. Leidos investors may, no later than May 5, 2021, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP, or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed as a lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member’s claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP prosecutes class actions in state and federal courts throughout the country involving securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duties and other violations of state and federal law. Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP is a driving force behind corporate governance reform, and has recovered billions of dollars on behalf of institutional and individual investors from the United States and around the world. The firm represents investors, consumers and whistleblowers (private citizens who report fraudulent practices against the government and share in the recovery of government dollars).

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than May 3, 2021. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience or resources. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020 founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the purported benefits of Leidos’ acquisition of L3Harris’ Security Detection & Automation businesses were significantly overstated; (2) Leidos’ products suffered from numerous product defects, including faulty explosive detection systems at airports, ports, and borders; (3) as a result of the foregoing, Leidos’ financial results were significantly overstated; and (4) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Leidos’ business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
