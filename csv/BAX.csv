What Happened: The FDA warned that the emergence of new variants or other COVID-19 challenges could prevent it from conducting in-person inspections. In the base-case scenario, FDA will work on mission-critical and priority domestic inspections for the next few months before resuming standard operations in July. If that happens, FDA expects to have cleared 26% of its backlog of medical products inspections by October. The agency continued doing mission-critical inspections, carrying out eight device-related assessments and more than 800 in total from March 2020 to March 2021. In July, FDA resumed prioritized domestic inspections and has since conducted 72 device assessments. The activity has failed to prevent the build of a backlog of inspections. FDA has delayed seven device application decisions solely due to pending inspections or facility assessments. As of March, FDA was yet to do 12 of the for-cause device inspections it plans to complete this fiscal year, which runs to the end of September. In the base-case scenario, FDA will resume standard operations in July. The change will enable FDA to start chipping away at the backlog of 2,002 domestic surveillance inspections at its device unit, which also has a backlog of 424 foreign site visits. The device department has a bigger backlog than the rest of the FDA’s human and animal medical products and tobacco groups combined. Including the device backlog, but not its food work, FDA has 3,229 domestic surveillance inspections remaining. Why It Matters: Even if standard operations resume this month, FDA only expects to complete half of the domestic surveillance inspections in the current financial year under the report’s best-case scenario. While there was a worst-case scenario outlined in the report, the agency did not offer any specific figure for how many inspections would be completed. The FDA will continue to use remote assessment tools when possible but needs to be on-site for many outstanding inspections. Notably, the annual Mammography Quality Standards Act mandates that inspections account for 25% of the remaining domestic assessments. FDA needs to visit sites in-person to perform those inspections.

Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Baxter Intl has. Baxter Intl's Debt According to the Baxter Intl's most recent balance sheet as reported on February 11, 2021, total debt is at $6.19 billion, with $5.79 billion in long-term debt and $406.00 million in current debt. Adjusting for $3.73 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $2.46 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Baxter Intl's $20.02 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.31. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Importance Of Debt Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?
