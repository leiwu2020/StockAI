That's for good reason. Currently, Facebook trades at a forward price-earnings multiple of 22.5-times. For its peer group, that’s cheap. (See Facebook stock charts on TipRanks)



Indeed, Facebook’s inherent value alongside its long-term growth potential has enticed many high-profile investors to jump aboard. One investor many have their eye on, Michael Burry, has bet big on Facebook this past quarter. 



Mr. Burry is the founder and manager of Scion Asset Management. Many investors know of Michael Burry via his portrayal in The Big Short, as one of the first to bet on the 2008/2009 housing collapse. He’s a person many view as a visionary. Accordingly, when he makes big bets, investors sit up in their chairs and pay attention.



Indeed, Mr. Burry’s recent use of call options to bet on Facebook has appeared to worked out well for this investor. Let’s dive a bit into what Mr. Burry’s position looks like, and why he may have decided now is the right time to pounce.



Burry Choosing Calls as the Investment Vehicle of Choice for FB Stock



When investors are bullish on the long-term prospects of a given company, most choose to go “long” via buying shares in said company. However, when investors are extremely bullish on the near- to medium-term potential of a given stock, buying call options can be a much more lucrative bet. Call options provide investors with greater upside potential (but higher downside risk), and are generally considered to reflect extremely high conviction on an upside move materializing in short order.



This past quarter, it was revealed through 13-F filings that Mr. Burry's fund had accumulated 550,000 call options on FB stock worth approximately $192 million. This made Facebook the number two holding of the fund, behind Alphabet (GOOG), at $195 million.



It’s important to note that these 550,000 call options were acquired some time during the past quarter. Accordingly, the exact timing of this bet is unknown. However, looking at the rather impressive year-to-date move we’ve seen in FB stock, it’s safe to say Burry has booked a nice profit on this trade, realized or not.



The timing of this trade is curious. It is also important to note that Facebook has been a favorite stock to trade for Mr. Burry in the past.



During the post-pandemic dip we saw in Q2 2020, Burry bet big on Facebook on the dip. At the time, Facebook calls took second place in Scion’s overall portfolio, as this famous investor bet big on a rebound in FB stock. He was right then, and it appears he’s right again.



Looking at his other top holdings, which included GameStop (GME), Goldman Sachs (GS), Booking Holdings (BKNG), and Alphabet (GOOG), investors can see why this guy is heralded as a genius in the investment community.



With Mr. Burry’s timing seemingly impeccable, investors are now forced to speculate as to whether Burry has sold out of his position, or whether he exercised these options. Given his previous moves in and out of calls in various stocks, it appears Scion’s upcoming 13-F filing will paint an interesting picture as to how bullish Mr. Burry is on Facebook’s prospects moving forward.



Is There Still Time to Capitalize on Facebook Stock?



As mentioned above, Facebook is a company that continues to trade at a relatively attractive valuation relative to its mega-cap tech peers. Accordingly, it’s a stock that has many value investors flocking to this growth stock for safety.



Indeed, such a view makes sense.



Facebook is among one of the top growth stocks among its mega-cap peers. The company’s forward revenue growth rate of 25% is incredible, given the company’s size. And Facebook’s profit margins are off the charts. The company produces gross margins of more than 80% currently. Thus, the amount of operating leverage with this stock is absolutely incredible.



Facebook’s ability to continue to monetize its platform has astounded investors who have held onto this name for the long haul. Indeed, all indications are that this level of high-quality, highly-profitable growth is likely to continue for some time.



As a long-term holding, Facebook stock now appears to be a holding catering to both growth and value investors. Accordingly, this is a stock many view as a unicorn in the markets today, and a relatively safe bet, given the margin of safety provided by Facebook’s robust growth rate.



What Analysts Are Saying About FB Stock



According to TipRanks’ analyst rating consensus, FB stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 34 analyst ratings, there are 29 Buy recommendations, 4 Hold recommendations, and 1 Sell recommendation.



As for price targets, the average Facebook analyst price target is $386.19. Analyst price targets range from a low of $275.00 per share to a high of $460.00 per share.







Bottom Line



Few stocks match up to the long-term growth potential of Facebook right now. This is a company which trades at a relative discount to its peer group, offering some of the best fundamentals of its group.



Additionally, Facebook is a stock that Michael Burry likes. Enough said.



Long-term investors will do well to consider this stock on any dips. Indeed, it appears Mr. Burry is selective with his entry points, and it’s unclear as to whether he’s currently holding Facebook. That said, the fact that he’s stepped into this stock on numerous occasions in the past is an indication of Facebook’s risk-reward profile today.

(ABNB) was fortunate enough to not be traded publicly until December 2020, and is now poised to capture the “biggest travel rebound in a century,” as one analyst put it. The world has changed a great deal over the last year, and with it, so have consumer trends and desires.  



Justin Post of Bank of America published a report detailing the more than 100 updates Airbnb made to its platform. Post reiterated a Hold rating and assigned a price target of $180, reflecting a potential upside of 21.26%.  



The five-star analyst wrote that the recently released upgrades will help Airbnb ride the fading pandemic’s tailwinds, as consumers look to book vacations on a more flexible basis. He delineated several reasons for this focus on flexible bookings, including an increase in remote work-from-home freeing up weekend time. Also, longer trips, which require longer-term hospitality solutions, are becoming more common. 



Many updates to the platform were directed to aid less professional hosts, providing streamlined property listing processes and a more organized and simplified support platform from which to manage bookings. Airbnb hoped to improve search capabilities for matching guests with hosts as well.  



In regards to share price action, a post-IPO lockup period recently expired and over $500 million in shares were made liquid. Although share price took a high volume hit for a day, the stock soon recovered and Post is encouraged that investors have moved past it.  



The analyst also mentioned that Booking.com of Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) has more exposure to the European markets, and as such stands to benefit more than Airbnb as U.S. travelers look to book trips abroad. Another downside can be opined that the travel industry recovery is already baked into Airbnb’s share price. Therefore, stock price would not necessarily be influenced by the number of  borders opening up this year for recreational tourism.  



On TipRanks, ABNB has an average rating consensus of Moderate Buy, and an average analyst Airbnb price target of $172.08, indicating a potential 12-month upside of 15.93%.

Will that result in an epic rebound in the price of Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock? Not necessarily. Yes, improved results may be just around the corner. But, you can make the argument that the “recovery” is already factored into its valuation. Source: AngieYeoh / Shutterstock.com After its IPO in December, the lodging booking platform’s shares bolted out of the gate. Priced at $68 per share, the stock closed at $146 on its first day of trading. Even as travel remained depressed due the second wave of Covid-19 in the U.S., the stock continued to trend higher through the winter. Boosted by the “meme stock”/Reddit stock trend, it hit a high of nearly $220 per share in February. But, since then, it’s pulled back substantially. Trading today for around $135 per share, it’s down nearly 39% off its highs. Even with this big decline, shares still price in an epic travel “reopening” as a certainty. At today’s prices, Airbnb trades at a high multiple to even 2022 projections. With such high expectations already baked-in, any ounce of disappointment could be enough to send it down to lower price levels. Not only that, the recent end to the insider lock-up may put downward pressure on it as well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips So, what’s the best move here? Other travel plays may have room to run, if recovery hopes pan out. With this in mind, there’s little reason to dive into this one at today’s prices. ABNB Stock and the Post-Pandemic ‘Reopening’ As seen from its recent earnings report, things are starting to come back for Airbnb, thanks to the vaccine rollout. Revenue for the quarter beat estimates, and bookings have surged in a big way. And, these results were from well before the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) made big changes to its safety guidance. With those vaccinated feeling more confident about getting back to normal, Airbnb could see its results improve further, as we enter the second half of 2021. Sell-side estimates call for revenue to come in at around $5.36 billion this year, a substantial jump from 2020’s sales levels ($3.38 billion). And, in 2022, sales could see another large boost, with sell-side projections ranging from $6.11 billion and $8.25 billion. The problem? ABNB stock already trades at a price that fully reflects this anticipated surge in its top line results. And then some. More richly priced than its peers, even following its around 39% stock price decline, it remains “priced for perfection.” This doesn’t automatically mean shares are set to pull back from here. But, it could show the stock is at best going to tread water. At worst? Sell off due to a correction in still-overheated travel booking plays. Valuation Continues to be a Top Concern Some Wall Street analysts, like RBC’s Brad Erickson, may see Airbnb as the standout travel recovery play. But, others on the sell-side have a more “on the fence” view of the stock. The key reason? Valuation concerns. According to Barron’s, 10 analysts have cut their price targets, citing the stock’s rich valuation relative to peers like Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) and Expedia Group (NASDAQ:EXPE). And, the premium applied to ABNB stock is on top of the overall frothiness surrounding travel booking stocks. Not only have BKNG and EXPE recovered from the 2020 stock price losses. Both today trade sharply above their pre-pandemic price levels. If travel numbers end up falling short of expectations calling for “pent up demand,” we could see names across the board correct. The result? Instead of moving back towards its high water mark, Airbnb shares could pull back, as enthusiasm for travel plays cools, and valuation concerns continue to mount. Worse yet, this isn’t the only factor that could weigh down on it. With its post-IPO lockup now over, insiders are more free to sell shares. Sure, even as its stock appears overvalued, insiders may not be rushing to cash out. But, it’s still another factor not working in favor of investors interested in buying ABNB stock today. Bottom Line: Other Travel Recovery Plays Offer More Room for Gains It’s understandable that, with recent headlines, investors are looking to bet big on a travel economy recovery. The issue? When it comes to names like travel booking stocks, much of the rebound is already priced-in. That’s especially the case for Airbnb, which today trades at a substantial premium to its already richly-priced peers. Add in the end of the insider lockup, and it may be tough for this recovery play to gain from here. With other kinds of travel stocks (like airlines) offering greater runway (if we see an off-the-charts resurgence in travel later this year), it may be best to stick to them, and steer clear of ABNB stock.

But the lingering effects of the pandemic could still be seen as the company’s loss ballooned, a result of repayment of debt it took on during the height of the crisis.The San Francisco-based company, which went public in December, reported $10.3 billion in gross bookings in the three months ended March 31, a 52% increase from the year earlier period and well beyond the $7.57 billion analysts’ had predicted. Revenue rose 5% to $887 million, also beating analyst’s projections.“While conditions aren’t yet normal, they are improving, and we expect a travel rebound unlike anything we have seen before,” the company wrote in a letter to shareholders accompanying the results. Airbnb didn’t release an official outlook for the current period, citing ongoing impacts of Covid-19, but said it expects gross bookings to be higher than 2019 levels and that April trends improved from March.“We were not expecting gross booking value to be quite as strong as it was,” Airbnb Chief Executive Officer Brian Chesky said in an interview on Bloomberg Television after the results were published. “We were expecting a strong quarter, but a travel company to actually grow in the midst of a pandemic that certainly was a pretty good scenario for us.”When people in the U.S. older than 60 became eligible for vaccinations earlier this year, Airbnb saw bookings for that age group jump 60%, Chesky said, adding the upcoming travel rebound will be “unlike anything you’ve seen in a century.”Airbnb’s shares fluctuated in extended trading after closing down 3.2% in New York at $135.75.The surprisingly positive results reflect a big upswing from a year ago, when Airbnb’s bookings plunged 80% after the coronavirus shut down most of the world. Travel was one of the hardest hit sectors of the economy in the pandemic, but Airbnb saw a swifter recovery than its peers when urbanites started abandoning their city apartments in favor of longer stays in rural rentals. Domestic leisure travel has continued to increase this year as vaccination rates have climbed in the U.S., with some analysts expecting Airbnb to see bookings return to pre-pandemic levels by summer. “We want to see if we are moving toward post-pandemic normalcy,” Ivan Feinseth, an analyst at Tigress Financial Partners, said in an interview before results were released.Prior to the pandemic, alternative accommodation, or non-hotel type lodgings that Airbnb specializes in, was already the fastest growing segment of the travel market and it’s now leading the rebound. Last week, Booking Holdings Inc. and Expedia Group Inc. reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, buoyed by vacation home-rental demand in the U.S. Both online travel agents said they would be trying to expand their property inventory in the U.S. to take on Airbnb in the peak summer season. Booking’s quarterly revenue declined 50% while Expedia’s was down 44% compared with a year earlier.Airbnb is fighting to retain its top position. In February, the company launched its biggest marketing campaign in five years in a bid to recruit more hosts and said it’s already driving new customers to its platform. Later this month, Airbnb will be unveiling a platform upgrade, which promises to streamline the process to become a host.Almost 60% of Airbnb’s revenue came from the U.S., where vaccines are now widely available, the company said. Guests are taking advantage of remote work policies and choosing to travel to non-urban areas and stay for longer: Nearly a quarter of Airbnb’s bookings in the first quarter were for stays longer than 28 days, an increase of 14% from 2019. Bookings in North America, primarily the U.S., increased to levels above 2019 in the first quarter, the company said.However, other countries are still struggling to contain Covid-19. India is reporting 4,000 deaths a day, meanwhile Europe’s vaccine rollout is lagging the U.S. and Australia has said its borders may be closed to international travelers for another year. As countries like the U.K. and France have announced reopenings and eased restrictions, Airbnb has seen a sharp increase in bookings, the company said. “We anticipate the pace of recovery in Europe will continue to be heavily influenced by the severity and duration of travel restrictions, but believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the recovery as they ease,” the company said.Releasing its financial results for the second time as a public company, Airbnb reported net loss of $1.17 billion, or $1.95 a share, significantly higher than the loss of $341 million a year earlier. Airbnb said it was due to the repayment of debt the company took on during the pandemic. In April 2020, Airbnb lined up about $2 billion in debt financing to help it grow and pay bills while travel demand was crushed.(Updates with comments from CEO beginning in the fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=378b15f1bbdd21f304350f8edb9f8d91728194a09c99701910ac6ffd7c783478

Revenue fell 44% to $1.25 billion, the Seattle-based company said Thursday in a statement, slightly ahead of analysts’ estimates. Shares climbed about 7% in extended trading.Still, the travel industry remains a “study in contrasts,” Chief Executive Officer Peter Kern said, as demand for international and business travel and conventional lodging remain challenged. “Beach and outdoor destinations have shown robust rebounds while major cities remain muted, and some regions have been growing while others remain locked down,” Kern said. “The market has clearly shown that when people feel safe to travel, demand comes roaring back.”After a year of pandemic-related border closures, steep revenue declines and mass layoffs, the travel sector is starting to see the green shoots of recovery. Booking Holdings Inc., the biggest online travel agency, on Wednesday reported a significant jump in the number of room-night reservations made in the beginning of the year. Analysts and industry experts expect the vaccine roll out in the U.S., which makes up more than 50% of Expedia’s revenue, will ignite a 2021 travel boom, driven largely by the alternative accommodation market.Expedia has seen booking trends “well above 2019 levels,” Kern said on a conference call with analysts after the results were released. Gross bookings, net of cancellations, were down about 40% in January. This improved to 20% in March and continued to show signs of growth into April, Kern said.“This is an unpredictable time,” Kern said. “Things could get worse before they get better, but we are optimistic we are seeing a lot of improvement across the globe.” The world will open up as the pace of vaccinations continues to increase, he said.Vrbo, which competes directly with Airbnb Inc., has weathered the pandemic better than its parent as travelers sought out regional staycations and remote work getaways. Expedia doesn’t disclose Vrbo metrics, but analysts expect the unit will lead Expedia’s recovery. Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman estimated Vrbo accounted for more than 40% of Expedia’s gross bookings value in the quarter, up from about 14% in the same period in 2019.Expedia has “amped up” its marketing investment in order to woo successful hosts from rival platforms, like Airbnb. “We are driving it as fast as we can,” Kern said.Truist Securities analyst Naved Khan predicted Vrbo would see “robust growth,” reflecting consumer interest in home rentals amid rising travel demand. “We estimate that Vrbo’s 2021 revenue could easily be 35% above 2019 levels,” Khan said in an interview before the results were released.Earlier this week, Expedia sold its corporate business travel arm, Egencia, to American Express Global Business Travel. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Expedia will become a shareholder and enter into a long-term commercial agreement with AmEx Global Business Travel as part of the agreement.Expedia reported an adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $58 million. Analysts were expecting a loss of $137.3 million. The adjusted loss per share was $2.02, beating the average analyst estimate of $2.27. Expedia’s shares are up about 25% this year, outperforming Booking and Airbnb, which were both up less than 5%.(Updates with comments from CEO in the fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=fd821a8f0aa84939d62e627c2ae636a657a3114073eedcd0d45b04eeb18113a3

The Best Brunch Restaurants in America list was culled from more than 12 million verified diner reviews of over 30,000 restaurants in 50 states and Washington, D.C. California is the most recognized state on the list with 17 restaurants honored, followed by Florida and Pennsylvania with eight winning restaurants. Illinois and Texas each boast seven winning restaurants and Georgia, Minnesota and Nevada claim six honorees. From restaurants with just the right ambiance for both indoor and outdoor dining, like Foreign Cinema in San Francisco, to sweet and savory favorites at Yardbird Southern Table and Bar in Las Vegas and Miami to local big-city favorites like Perch in Los Angeles, the Best Brunch list features a wide variety of options for any type of menu and environment diners are looking for. The annual list comes on the heels of OpenTable's national “Frame the Feeling” promotion, an initiative to help families capture the moment as they reconnect this Mother’s Day. The campaign offers professional family photos for all reservations made on Mother’s Day at 14 select restaurants nationwide.

(NASDAQ: BKNG), Mother’s Day reservations are up 64% compared to 2019 (pre-pandemic levels), indicating strong demand for dining out with loved ones again. In fact, a recent survey* conducted by OpenTable showed one in three Americans haven’t had an extended family gathering in over a year and 63% either haven’t had a professional family picture in that time or can’t remember the last time they had one taken. To help families capture their reunions this Mother’s Day, OpenTable today launched the “Frame the Feeling” campaign, bringing together 14 iconic restaurant partners in 14 cities nationwide to offer complimentary professional photographs at participating restaurants this Mother’s Day (May 9, 2021). “Based on our data, Mother’s Day 2021 is shaping up to be the first holiday where many families will celebrate and dine out together - an experience diners are eagerly anticipating after more than a year of restrictions,” said Debby Soo, CEO of OpenTable. “We want to help people commemorate their overdue family reunions by offering a priceless photo that captures the cherished feeling of seeing loved ones around the table at their favorite restaurants after being apart for so long.” Furthermore, nearly 43% of Americans say they’d dine out for Mother’s Day if restaurants safely offered a professional family photo. Families will have the opportunity to snap a photo through OpenTable’s partnership with local photographers and restaurant partners and download their photo online afterwards - all free of charge. Participating OpenTable restaurants will offer the opportunity to capture a Mother’s Day photo from 11:30 - 2 p.m. (local time) and include: a’Bouzy - Houston, TXAlden and Harlow - Cambridge, MABrennan’s - New Orleans, LACabra - Chicago, ILEl Five - Denver, COHoney Salt - Las Vegas, NVIron Gate - Washington D.C.Jack’s Wife Freda - New York, NYMerriman’s - Honolulu, HIMILA - Miami, FLPositano Coast by Aldo Lamberti - Philadelphia, PAPresidio Social Club - San Francisco, CAThe Rose - Venice, CARumi’s Kitchen - Atlanta, GA For more information about OpenTable’s “Frame the Feeling” Mother’s Day offering visit the OpenTable blog at http://blog.opentable.com/2021/mothers-day-2021-frame-the-feeling. *OT Survey Methodology:OpenTable partnered with YouGov on April 19 - 20, 2021 to survey 1,326 adults (aged 18+) online within the U.S. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all U.S. adults (aged 18+).
