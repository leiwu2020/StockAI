COVID-19 Pandemic The Company’s top priority remains the health, safety and well-being of its employees. The Company’s flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities, have operated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company’s bottlers/distributors are operating and the Company’s products remain generally available to consumers. In limited countries, the operations of the Company’s bottlers/distributors have, in part, been negatively affected for varying periods of time. Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company achieved record first quarter net sales. Currently, the Company does not foresee a material impact on the ability of its co-packers to manufacture and its bottlers/distributors to distribute its products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company’s supply chain remains largely intact. However, the Company is experiencing shortages in its aluminum can requirements in North America and Europe, given the Company’s volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. The Company has taken steps to source additional quantities of aluminum cans from South America and Asia, however, logistical issues, including ocean freight and port of entry congestion could delay such supply. Logistical issues in relation to the importation of certain other raw materials and ingredients could impact future supply. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had $1.18 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $980.1 million in short-term investments and $63.8 million in long-term investments. Based on currently available information, the Company does not expect the COVID-19 pandemic to have a material impact on its liquidity. First Quarter Results Net sales for the 2021 first quarter increased 17.1 percent to $1.24 billion, from $1.06 billion in the same period last year. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales for the 2021 first quarter of $9.3 million. Net sales for the Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment, which primarily includes the Company’s Monster Energy® drinks and Reign Total Body Fuel® high performance energy drinks, increased 17.9 percent to $1.17 billion for the 2021 first quarter, from $992.5 million for the 2020 first quarter. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $9.3 million for the 2021 first quarter. Net sales for the Company’s Strategic Brands segment, which primarily includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company, as well as the Company’s affordable energy brands, increased 5.1 percent to $67.8 million for the 2021 first quarter, from $64.5 million in the 2020 first quarter. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had no significant impact on net sales for the Strategic Brands segment for the 2021 first quarter. Net sales for the Company’s Other segment, which includes certain products of American Fruits and Flavors, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, sold to independent third-party customers (the “AFF Third-Party Products”), increased to $5.7 million for the 2021 first quarter, from $5.1 million in the 2020 first quarter. Net sales to customers outside the United States increased 28.8 percent to $459.4 million in the 2021 first quarter, from $356.8 million in the 2020 first quarter. Such sales were approximately 37 percent of total net sales in the 2021 first quarter, compared with 34 percent in the 2020 first quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, for the 2021 first quarter was 57.5 percent, compared with 60.0 percent in the 2020 first quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2021 first quarter was primarily the result of increased input costs (mainly increased raw material freight-in costs), geographical sales mix, and higher promotional allowances as a percentage of net sales. Operating expenses for the 2021 first quarter were $300.8 million, compared with $272.2 million in the 2020 first quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2021 first quarter were 24.2 percent, compared with 25.6 percent in the 2020 first quarter. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 4.4 percent for the 2021 first quarter, compared with 3.7 percent in the 2020 first quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2021 first quarter were 9.2 percent, compared with 10.3 percent in the 2020 first quarter. General and administrative expenses for the 2021 first quarter were $131.9 million, or 10.6 percent of net sales, compared with $124.1 million, or 11.7 percent of net sales, for the 2020 first quarter. Stock-based compensation was $18.4 million for the first quarter of 2021, compared with $17.1 million in the 2020 first quarter. Operating income for the 2021 first quarter increased to $414.1 million, from $365.0 million in the 2020 first quarter. The effective tax rate was 23.8 percent for both the 2021 and 2020 first quarters. Net income for the 2021 first quarter increased 13.0 percent to $315.2 million, from $278.8 million in the 2020 first quarter. Net income per diluted share for the 2021 first quarter increased 14.2 percent to $0.59, from $0.52 in the first quarter of 2020. Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, said: “The Company posted record first quarter net sales and profits, despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. “According to Nielsen, the energy drink category, and in particular our Monster Energy® brand, continues to accelerate in most of our markets, including the United States. “In the first quarter of 2021, we continued with our robust program of product launches in both our domestic and international markets, with plans for additional launches during 2021,” Sacks added. Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer Hilton H. Schlosberg said: “In order to satisfy increased consumer demand, we are sourcing aluminum cans in excess of our contracted volumes from South America and Asia. In addition, to meet consumer demand, we experienced freight inefficiencies in the United States and in Europe in the quarter, which resulted in increased costs of sales as well as increased operating expenses. “We are pleased with the early results for our new energy drinks that were launched in the quarter,” Schlosberg added. Share Repurchase Program No shares of the Company’s common stock were repurchased during the 2021 first quarter. As of May 6, 2021, approximately $441.5 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program.

company,1617379178,"With Valuations Stretched, Monster Beverage Is Running Out Of Fizz",66828686,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4IJtqoRsaEN9C1_lKaY5pw--~B/aD01NDM7dz0xMDI0O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/tipranks_452/9851a4b618521d7d84ef5f969d068dbe,MNST,Yahoo,"Shares of Monster Beverage (MNST) have delivered a stunning performance over the past twelve months. Shares took a big leap in the second half of 2020 having quickly recovered to pre-pandemic levels following the COVID-19 crash. But since the beginning of 2021, MNST stock has traded relatively sideways between $85 and $95 per share. This makes sense given its current stretched valuation following last year’s massive move upward, however, the underlying fundamentals for the company remain strong. So, what’s next for Monster Beverage? While markets remain robust, the stock could hold onto most of its prior year gains and continue to trade around current levels, but if markets take a tumble in the near-term, richly priced names like MNST could potentially see the heaviest declines. Monster Beverage’s Valuation Concerns There is some rationale behind Monster Beverage’s rich valuation with its strong balance sheet, consistent cash flows, and runway for 10-15% revenue and earnings growth in the coming years. The launch of a new premium energy drink brand has also boosted its prospects and some analysts believe that the company’s growth could top expectations. But these positives may not be enough to sustain it at recent prices. Monster Beverage currently sports a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of around 33x. In comparison, its similarly sized peer, Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) has a much more modest forward PE of 21.5x, and National Beverage (FIZZ), a smaller competitor and the maker of La Croix, has a forward multiple of around 24.9x. This does not mean that MNST stock will eventually revert to the mean and fall to a valuation on par with peers, but if markets correct in the coming months, this “priced for perfection” name could see some valuation contraction. Vulnerable If Markets Pull Back It’s hard to tell whether the markets are gearing up for another pullback, or if the bears are underestimating the strength of the overall economic recovery. With interest rates expected to rise, and other factors pointing to a market-wide correction, buying high-flying names while they trade near all-time highs could result in some heavy near-term losses. If markets-at-large correct, it won’t necessarily matter what stocks investors own as we would probably see a dip across most equities. But stocks like MNST which are trading at stretched-out multiples could see more out-sized moves lower. While this is not set in stone, bearing this concern in mind might be prudent and waiting for a more reasonable valuation to enter a position may be the best move. What Analysts Are Saying About MNST Stock According to TipRanks, MNST comes in as a Strong Buy based on 14 analyst ratings. Of these, 11 rate it a Buy, 3 recommend a Hold while none suggest a Sell. As for price targets, the average analyst price target on Monster Beverage stock is $103.83 per share, which implies around 14% upside potential from current prices. Analyst price targets range from a low of $94 per share to a high of $118 per share. (See Monster Beverage stock analysis on TipRanks) Bottom Line: Wait For More Reasonable Prices The fundamentals for Monster Beverage stock remain rock-solid. The company is still set to deliver double-digit earnings growth in 2021 (around 13.5%) and 2022 (around 13%). There is also the possibility that actual results will exceed these already great projections. While there is some justification for a premium valuation, perhaps not to the levels currently seen with the stock. If markets experience another sell-off, it’s stocks like this one that could produce outsized losses. So, what’s the best move right now? Waiting for more reasonable prices before buying MNST stock might be the sensible thing for investors to consider.

One such opportunity is in one of my favorite small-cap growth stocks, healthy energy drink maker Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH). Back in early September 2020, I told subscribers of my financial newsletter The Daily 10X Stock Report — which is aimed at delivering to your inbox, every single day, a stock pick that could rise by at least 10X — that CELH stock was a strong buy because Celsius was turning into the next Monster (NASDAQ:MNST). Source: Shutterstock At the time, CELH stock was trading below $20. Four months later, in January, Celsius stock had skyrocketed to $70 — representing a whopping 250% return in less than half a year.

Silicon Valley Whiz Kid Reveals No. 1 Tech Stock in America This dip is a golden buying opportunity into one of the most exciting hypergrowth stocks in the market today. Silicon Valley Whiz Kid Reveals #1 Tech Stock in America Here’s why. CELH Stock: The Energy Drink Company of the Future I’m a huge fan of CELH stock long-term because, from where I sit, Celsius looks like the healthy energy drink company of the future — a company that will, one day, challenge Monster and Red Bull for supremacy in the energy drink category. Here’s the story. Humans love to feel energized. Naturally, they also love energy drinks. That’s why the energy drink market is one of the larger beverage markets in the world at $60, and also the fastest growing beverage category with a 7% compounded annual growth rate. But this hypergrowth category has grown out-of-sync with consumer demand. That is, consumers are increasingly demanding healthy, all-natural, and functional foods and drinks. Yet, the titans of the energy drink industry — Red Bull, Monster, and Rock Star — are still selling a bunch of sugar-loaded, not-that-good-for-you energy drinks. This reality represents an enormous opportunity for Celsius Holdings, a relatively new and small energy drink maker that is cutting out a niche for itself in the overlap of rising pro-health trends and huge energy drink demand. Capitalizing on the Pro-Health Shift Leaning into its proprietary scientific formulation which combines green tea with EGCG, ginger and guarana seed to catalyze thermogenesis, Celsius has a created a portfolio of unique, functional healthy energy drinks that have been proven to energize, accelerate metabolism, and burn body fat and calories… all at once. Plus, the drinks are vegan. Gluten-free. Non-GMO. Contain zero sugar. Have zero preservatives. Zero artificial colors or flavors. Zero aspartame. You know… all the good stuff that young, pro-health consumers are looking for in a “clean label” these days. To that end, Celsius has created a scientifically superior and socially more relevant energy drink which has the potential to turn into the next big thing in this massive category. Over the next several years, I fully expect Celsius to leverage these pro-health drinks with its eco-friendly branding to rapidly expand product distribution, drum up huge consumer demand, and ultimately turn into a mini-Monster. The upside for CELH stock comes from the fact that Monster is worth $50 billion, while Celsius is worth just $3.4 billion today. Business Momentum Is Building My bullishness on CELH stock is reinforced by the company’s strong execution over the past several years, in which the company has rapidly expanded product distribution and increased demand to the tune of a 665% increase in sales since 2015. Investors are concerned that this growth trend is slowing. Fourth quarter revenues declined from the third quarter. That’s why CELH stock fell off a cliff recently. But this drawdown in revenues is due to Covid-19 related restrictions in the company’s international markets. Backing those one-off headwinds out, the underlying business momentum here remains vigorous. The company continues to rapidly expand distribution. In 2020, Celsius’ distribution footprint expanded by 18,000 stores to 82,000 stores by the end of the year. Management expects this expansion to accelerate in 2021, as retailers who have delayed planogram resets — many of which include more shelf space for Celsius — execute those resets at Covid-19 restrictions ease. Perhaps more importantly, Celsius continues to expand market share in the energy drink category at a rapid pace. According to U.S. SPINS data, Celsius’ sales for the 52 weeks ended January 24, 2021 increased 58% year-over-year, about 8X that of the energy drink market’s overall growth rate. Concurrently, recent Nielsen data for the four weeks ended Feb. 20, 2021 shows that Celsius’ sales rose 98% in that time frame, with the next closest competitor (Red Bull) registering just an 18% growth rate. And on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) — which is Celsius’ most established channel — Celsius increased market share in February by 2.1 percentage points to 14.5%. In that world, Celsius is now almost as big as Red Bull (14.7% share). From head to toe, then, the Celsius growth narrative is still on fire — despite the recent plunge in CELH stock. That ultimately means that this selloff is a buying opportunity. Celsius Stock Is Undervalued By my numbers, Celsius stock is dramatically undervalued following its recent 35% haircut. Celsius owns about 14.5% of the energy drink market on Amazon.com, where distribution is equal among all energy drink players. I fully expect, given Celsius’ impressive sales velocity and shifting consumer demand for healthier drinks, that physical retail distribution will equalize over the next several years, too. By 2030, Celsius drinks should be as widely available in grocery, general merchandise, and convenience stores as Monster and Red Bull drinks. Assuming so, Celsius’ overall share of the energy drink category should rise to 14.5% over time. According to management, that equates to a $2 billion revenue opportunity. That’s roughly where I think revenues will trend over the next decade. Assuming similar profit margins and valuation multiples as Monster, my modeling suggests that CELH stock is worth around $70 today. That’s why I think CELH stock will make a run back to all time highs once interest rate volatility passes. Bottom Line on CELH Stock The growth stock meltdown has created multiple golden buying opportunities. CELH stock is one such opportunity. But it’s not the best opportunity. Instead, the best opportunity is in a company that reminds me of a young Amazon. Indeed, I think buying this stock today could be like buying AMZN stock back in 1997 — before it soared thousands of percent. Which stock am I talking about?

company,1614447759,"RBC: Keurig Dr Pepper Growth 'Gets Another Jolt', 'Monster' Results From Monster Beverage",66828748,,MNST,Yahoo,"RBC analysts maintained a bullish stance on Keurig Dr Pepper Inc (NASDAQ: KDP) and Monster Beverage Corp (NASDAQ: MNST) after the two beverage giants reported encouraging fourth quarter results. The Keurig Dr Pepper and Monster Beverage Analyst: Nik Modi maintains an Outperform rating on Keurig Dr Pepper's stock with an unchanged $37 price target. Modi also maintains an Outperform rating on Monster Beverage's stock with an unchanged $104 price target. The Monster Beverage Thesis: Monster Beverage posted ""very strong results"" that suggest momentum continued into 2021, Modi wrote in a note. The three main positive takeaways from the company's fourth quarter earnings report are: 1. US net sales growth of 16.3% beat expectations of 8% and improved 720 basis points sequentially to 11.8% on a two-year average basis. 2. International net sales improved by 20.4% in the quarter and 18.5% on a two-year average basis. The performance was ""solid"" as the company was up against difficult restrictive measures, especially across Europe. 3. January gross sales were higher by 17.2% year-over-year despite two fewer selling days. Two negative takeaways that are worth noting are: 1) Net sales were impacted by $15.2 million due to product returns in Europe and a labelling issue in Japan, and 2) gross margin contracted by 75 basis points even when the returns are excluded. Management said it will provide a product update soon although its tone on a hard seltzer launch ""was a bit less optimistic"" than prior commentary, Modi wrote. While a hard seltzer launch could come in 2022, near-term products will likely focus on caffeinated and non-alcoholic seltzers. Related Link: Wells Fargo Taps Coca Cola, Monster In The Beverage Stock Race The Keurig Dr Pepper Thesis: Keurig Dr Pepper saw continued momentum in the coffee category along with gains in packaged beverages, Modi wrote in a note. The three main takeaways from the company's fourth quarter earnings report are: 1. Coffee Systems shows a (constant currency) sales growth rate of 8.9% in the quarter while the two-year average sales growth accelerated 4 percentage points since September at 6.5%. 2. Packaged beverages grew 7.9% versus the consensus estimate of 5%. The momentum was driven by volume and price mix and cold beverage market share gains. 3. Management's target market of households that could convert to a single-serve coffee machine stands at 60 million. Looking forward to 2021, Keurig Dr Pepper expects to exceed its original merger target of 2% to 3% annual revenue growth and deliver synergies of $200 million, the analyst wrote. Management is also targeting 3% to 4% sales growth and EPS growth of 13% to 15% in 2021. ""We believe KDP has a very unique combination of strong underlying growth and significant balance sheet optionality,"" Modi wrote.
