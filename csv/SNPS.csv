The financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.



Jacob Avidan, SVP of engineering for the Digital Design Group at Synopsys, commented, ""Robustness has become an essential design quality metric, in addition to power, performance, and area, for our leading-edge customers, such as Samsung,""



He further added, ""PrimeShield continues its technology advancements with machine learning-driven robustness analysis and optimization to improve design immunity to variation. As part of the Fusion Design Platform, it effectively helps deliver superior power and performance along with cost-effective designs for our customers.""



Rosenblatt Securities analyst John McPeake recently initiated coverage on Synopsys with a Buy rating and a price target of $302 (10.3% upside potential).

Overall, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 4 unanimous Buys. The average Synopsys analyst price target of $318.33 implies 16.3% upside potential from current levels. Shares of SNPS have jumped 44% over the past year.

Trac Pham, the company’s CFO said, “We continue to execute well on our strategy to balance strategic investments to grow the business, expand margins and return capital to stockholders.”

The program may be terminated or suspended at any time by the company’s CFO or at the Board’s discretion.



After a recent interview with the company’s top brass, Robert W. Baird analyst Joseph Vruwink maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $320, implying 20.7% upside potential to current levels.

Synopsys is an electronic design automation company that focuses on silicon design and verification, silicon intellectual property and software security and quality.



Code Dx is the provider of an application that automates and accelerates the discovery, prioritization, and remediation of software vulnerabilities.



The terms of the deal have been kept under wraps. The acquisition expands Synopsys' portfolio of application security tools and services. 



Synopsys Software Integrity Group’s general manager Jason Schmitt said, “While robust security testing is vital to securing modern software, it often produces large amounts of vulnerability data that is difficult to manage. Code Dx enables our customers to optimize and harness the breadth of our application security portfolio, along with third-party tools, by aggregating, correlating, and prioritizing security testing results based on risk.” (See Synopsys stock analysis on TipRanks)



On June 1, Rosenblatt Securities analyst John McPeake initiated coverage of the stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $302 (18.4% upside potential).



McPeake said, “We think ballooning chip and packaging complexity, increasing levels of software on the chip, new vertical markets, and Synopsys' AI-enabled Fusion Compiler have positioned the company for an inflection in demand and revenue growth.”



The consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 4 unanimous Buys. SNPS average analyst price target of $318.3 implies a 24.8% upside potential. Shares have gained 34.5% over the past year.



Synopsys scores a “Perfect 10” on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

The latter provides Ethernet Digital Controller IP, which supports data rates of 10G to 800G. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed by the company. Joachim Kunkel, General Manager of the Solutions Group at Synopsys (SNPS), said, “Hyperscale cloud data centers continue to evolve due to tremendous internet traffic growth, driving the need for high-speed interfaces to optimize data processing, networking, and storage in the cloud.” Kunkel added, “The acquisition of MorethanIP enables us to build on our leading Ethernet IP portfolio and provide a complete controller and PHY Ethernet IP solution that addresses the performance and latency requirements of 200G/400G/800G cloud computing designs, while allowing customers to comprehensively meet their needs for high-quality IP solutions from a single, trusted supplier.” (See Synopsys stock analysis on TipRanks) This acquisition expands Synopsys’ DesignWare Ethernet Controller IP portfolio and the acquired MAC and PCS IP complement the company’s current 112G Ethernet PHY IP solution. Synopsys expects the transaction to close in May. Synopsys has a broad DesignWare IP portfolio and its IP Accelerated initiative includes IP prototyping kits, IP software development kits, and IP subsystems. This, coupled with technical support, helps designers to minimize integration risk and speed up the product time-to-market. Recently, Needham analyst Richard Valera reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $310 (20.1% upside potential) from $275. Commenting on the company’s quarterly performance, Valera said, “With the company’s SIG business expected to gain steam as F21 progresses, and expectations for ongoing strength in its core business, underpinned by strong design activity in AI, 5G, HPC, and Auto, we see SNPS’ fundamental outlook as robust.” Overall, the consensus among analysts is that Synopsys is a Strong Buy, based on 9 unanimous Buys.

According to the majority of US Equity Research analysts at RBC Capital, the outlook for the rest of the year remains positive, too. A recent analyst survey at the investment firm revealed that 67% have a bullish or very bullish outlook for performance of the stocks in their respective industries over the next 6-12 months. Looking ahead, the analysts are concerned by Covid-19 related uncertainty and monetary policy more than inflation and are particularly buoyant regarding the cash deployment outlook, margin expansion and fundamentals. On the other hand, less than half of those surveyed think valuations for their industries are attractive. That’s not a problem, however, for a pair of stocks recently highlighted by two of RBC’s top analysts. And when we say top analysts making these calls, we mean it. These are stock picks from analysts among the top 15 in the TipRanks database. It also doesn’t hurt that each stock is admired by the rest of the analyst community, enough so to earn a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Visa, Inc. (V) The first stock we’re looking at, Visa, is a stalwart of the equity markets. Visa is a $480 billion company, and a long-time component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The company dominates the world’s banking card industry, with a 50% market share globally, excluding China. Unfortunately for Visa, it’s very size has worked against it recently. The US Department of Justice has opened an investigation of Visa’s debit card practices – specifically, into whether or not the company has engaged in illegal anticompetitive practices by preventing merchants from routing Visa-branded debit card transactions over less-expensive networks. The DOJ move comes after Visa has had a difficult year. The corona crisis, and the governmental reactions to it, tanked economies and trade worldwide; the reduction in commerce sent ripple effects through multiple industries, including payment processors like Visa. The company’s last three quarters have all shown year-over-year declines in revenues and earnings – although, since Q3 fiscal 2020, the results have been growing sequentially, an indication that improved economic conditions are stimulating commercial activity. Visa’s most recent report, for Q1 fiscal 2021, showed $5.7 billion at the top line with $3.04 billion in net earnings. These numbers were down 6% and 4% from the prior year quarter. Three major metrics, however, all point toward continued recovery: payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions were up from 4Q20. And even the top line revenue was up 12% quarter-over-quarter. Visa’s management expressed confidence in the results, and showed it by authorizing an additional $8 billion to the company’s share repurchase program, bringing the total fund available for capital returns to $11 billion. This came after Visa returned $2.5 billion to shareholders in fiscal first quarter. Covering Visa for RBC is 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin, who's ranked #8 in the TipRanks database. Perlin is of the opinion that there are better days ahead for the stock. “Visa’s current quarter and forward commentary firmly re-establishes the durability in the model long-term as cross-border, debit, and ecommerce volumes all point to better days ahead... the quarter’s cross-border results were better than it had previously forecasted and drove what it considered an overall stronger-than-expected FQ1/21,"" Perlin noted. The analyst summed up, ""As the path to 'normalization' becomes clearer, likely in the second half of calendar 2021, we believe many of the positive structural changes that are now benefiting Visa will persist, while cyclical drags (such as short-haul travel) will modestly abate…” In line with his comments, Perlin rates Visa stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $297 price target indicating a potential 36% upside in the year ahead. (To watch Perlin’s track record, click here) Overall, it’s clear that Wall Street agrees with the bullish outlook on Visa. The stock has 18 recent reviews, breaking down 16 to 2 in favor of Buy versus Hold. V shares are trading for $216.86, and their average target of $247.67 implies a one-year upside of ~13%. (See Visa stock analysis on TipRanks) Synopsys (SNPS) From the payment industry we transition to where the semiconductor and software segments intersect. Synopsys is one of the world’s largest software companies and specializes in Electronic design automation (EDA), also known as electronic computer-aided design (ECAD). While the company operates in close proximity to the semiconductor sector, it is not impacted by the cyclical nature of the chip industry. Synopsys isn't a semiconductor manufacturer per se but provides the tools for engineers to test and design cutting-edge semiconductors. The company delivered a strong display in its latest quarterly financial report. Revenue hit $970.32 million, increasing by 16.3% year-over-year, and beating the consensus estimates by $15.95 million. There was a beat on the bottom-line, too, as Non-GAAP EPS of $1.52 came ahead of Wall Street’s forecast by $0.06 That said, after shares appreciated by 83% throughout 2020, the stock has found 2021 tough going, and sits slightly in the red. RBC’s Mitch Steves, however, expects that to change over the next 12 months. The 5-star analyst, rated #15 overall on TipRanks, noted, ""Synopsys has a record of stable operations, a well-managed order pipeline, and predictable earnings. We expect it to benefit from an improving pricing environment in the sector and strong growth in IP offerings. We expect earnings growth above normalized EPS growth for semiconductor companies, with almost no volatility.” Steves added, “We see no change to the fundamental thesis and continue to believe that EDA is one of the best (if not the best) ways to invest in semiconductor growth long-term without material business volatility. Net Net: we remain positive on shares of SNPS.” In line with his optimistic approach, Steves rates SNPS an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $330 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of 28% from current levels. (To watch Steves’ track record, click here) Steves’ positive outlook resonates with almost all his colleagues. Barring 1 Hold, all 9 other reviews say Buy, culminating in a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target currently stands at $318.89, suggesting gains of ~24% in the year ahead.

(See Synopsys stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the impressive results, Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer raised the stock’s price target to $300 (15.3% upside potential) from $265 and maintained a Buy rating. The analyst believes that there are multiple drivers to EDA [electronic design automation], which would support a premium to long-term Semi CAGR of 6%-8%. Meanwhile, the Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on the stock based on 9 Buys and 1 Hold. The average analyst price target of $318.89 implies upside potential of about 22.6% to current levels.
