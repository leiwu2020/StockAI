(KMI) announced that it has agreed to acquire liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplier Kinetrex Energy from an affiliate of Parallel49 Equity for $310 million. The deal is likely to close in the third quarter of 2021.



Following the news, shares of the company declined 1.2% in Friday’s trading session and closed at $17.71 in the extended trading session.



With this buyout, Kinder Morgan will gain access to two small-scale production and fueling facilities, a 50% interest in a landfill renewable natural gas (RNG) facility, and three additional RNG facilities with signed commercial arrangements.



Kinder Morgan believes the purchase to be value accretive to its shareholders as the three RNG facilities become operational over the next 18 months. Further, the acquisition price and additional capital expenditures are six times less than the expected 2023 EBITDA.



The President of Kinder Morgan Energy Transition Ventures (ETV), Jesse Arenivas, said, ""We have been focused on RNG due to its potential to grow rapidly in the near term and deliver attractive returns, with landfills providing a low cost, predictable and long-term feedstock. The team at Kinetrex has developed an outstanding business model and platform for future growth in a fragmented market, and we are excited to welcome them to Kinder Morgan."" (See Kinder Morgan stock chart on TipRanks)



Recently, TD Securities analyst Linda Ezergailis reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. The analyst, however, raised the price target from $20 to $21, which implies an upside potential of 19.1% from current levels. 



Consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 2 Buys, 7 Holds, and 3 Sells. The average Kinder Morgan price target stands at $18.09, which implies upside potential of 2.6% from current levels. Shares have gained 21.7% over the past year.

The transaction should close in the third quarter, subject to regulatory approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

The unit that Kinder Morgan is acquiring consists of 4 storage facilities for the natural gas pipeline network. The purchase bid represents about ten times Stagecoach’s 2020 EBITDA. The acquisition should allow Kinder Morgan to enhance service delivery to customers in the Northeast market.  (See Kinder Morgan stock analysis on TipRanks).

""These natural gas pipeline and storage facilities help connect natural gas supply sources and Northeast demand areas. Natural gas has long been responsible for providing heat and hot water to homes and businesses in the Northeast, and it now has an increasingly vital role as a reliable, low emissions partner backing up growing renewable power generation,"" said Kimberly Watson, KMI's head of Interstate Natural Gas Pipelines. (See Crestwood Equity stock analysis on TipRanks).

Last week, Morgan Stanley analyst Devin McDermott downgraded Kinder Morgan to a Sell citing near-term pandemic headwinds.

“Model adjustments to reflect temporary Winter Storm Uri benefits and certain near-term pandemic headwinds (weaker refined product volumes, lower Jones Act tanker renewal rates) largely wash out from a valuation perspective and unchanged resulting DCF fair value screens more consistent with the Underweight grouping,” McDermott stated.

The analyst has a price target of $18 on the stock, implying 2.76% downside potential to current levels.

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Hold based on 1 Buy, 7 Hold, and 2 Sell ratings. The average analyst price target of $17.44 implies 5.78% downside potential to current levels.

KMI scores a 5 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, suggesting that the stock is likely to perform in line with market averages.

In a job post on LinkedIn, the company is looking for someone with at least seven years of experience in marketing and trading refined petroleum products who will be “responsible for developing profitable commercial opportunities.”The shift means that one of the most powerful companies in the U.S. fuel business is poised to gain even more clout. Co-founded by billionaire Rich Kinder, the Houston-based firm operates about 3,000 miles of refined-product pipelines from Texas and California to Oregon and Washington.Major U.S. pipeline companies don’t usually trade petroleum products. Rivals like Plains All American Pipeline LP and Enterprise Products Partners LP, for instance, trade mostly crude and natural gas liquids on a regular basis.Energy Transfer LP, however, owns Sunoco LP, which actively trades fuels like gasoline and diesel. The pipeline giant controlled by billionaire Kelcy Warren also emerged as a winner from the Texas storm in February, making about $2.4 billion.Both Kinder and Energy Transfer shocked many in the energy industry when they reported gains from selling natural gas at skyrocketing prices during the deadly winter storm that left millions without power and heating.Kinder declined to comment.The company’s shares have jumped 34% this year.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=04ead69695d9a0017c7487169b684ba10a791b4af861326873fd4e6dccc5b5d7

The earnings report caught analysts off guard and raises the prospect of more surprises to come in the latest round of quarterly earnings.Kinder’s bombshell disclosure “will surely set in motion a thematic that will likely carry through” quarterly earnings season, said Timm Schneider, a Citigroup Inc. analyst. “Further, we view KMI’s large beat as a ‘zero-sum-game,’ meaning someone (i.e. buyers of the gas) had to pay the bill, which could make for some interesting utility earnings calls.”Kinder’s sprawling network of pipelines and gas storage facilities positioned it to ramp up shipments to power generators at the height of the emergency as wells and pumping stations froze.Other Kinder peers seen as potential winners from the Arctic blast include Enterprise Product Partners LP and Energy Transfer LP. There is ample room for upside: Prior to Kinder’s announcement, analysts were forecasting the lowest first-quarter adjusted profit per share in four years for Enterprise. Meanwhile, Energy Transfer was expected to bounce back from an atrocious year-earlier performance but still fall short of 2019 results.Energy Transfer Co-Chief Executive Officer Marshall McCrea foreshadowed a banner quarter before the storm had even ended, telling investors during a conference call that the company did “exceptionally well” as gas shortages spurred orders for fuel stowed in underground caverns.READ: Texas Missed Out on a Cheap Fix to Its Fragile Power GridThe pipeline giant created by billionaire Kelcy Warren is facing backlash from at least one Texas utility that objected to the rates it was charged for gas. CPS Energy has sued Energy Transfer as well as BP Plc, Chevron Corp. and others for allegedly charging 15,000% more than the typical price for gas.On the other side of the market, the list of self-admitted or probable losers is long.Atmos Energy Corp., a Dallas-based utility that ships gas to 3 million homes and businesses across eight states, racked up $2.5 billion in fuel costs during the disaster. Calpine Corp., Vistra Corp. and NRG Energy Inc. all said disruptions to gas deliveries interfered with their ability to generate power just as frigid weather sent residential demand soaring.‘Wealth Transfer’Vistra has gone as far as to warn the event may have slashed $1.3 billion in profit.“There was a significant amount of wealth transfer from power to gas,” Vistra Chief Executive Officer Curt Morgan told a state legislative hearing in February. “We’re the guy sitting in the middle, getting it from both ends.”The burden is so heavy on municipal utilities and rural energy cooperatives that Texas lawmakers are considering a rescue that could include sales of low-interest 30-year bonds backed by extra charges on residential bills.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=10f4893c08f71281ff9850bdf9f72c84000dc2768ba2cf621e3aafee49515744

The gain was so outsized that the pipeline operator results surpassed the average estimate by almost three times.Kinder Morgan “was not really on anyone’s list of potential winners from Winter Storm Uri,” said Gabriel Moreen, an analyst at Mizuho Americas LLC. “Shame on us.”Kinder disclosed a $116 million net gain from voluntarily curbing power use during the disaster and reselling it at sky-high prices, which implies an $880 million windfall from gas sales. A Kinder Morgan spokesperson declined to comment on the figures.Losers, WinnersPower producers and utilities across the Lone Star state incurred billions of dollars in losses when the Arctic blast hobbled the electricity grid and disrupted gas deliveries, pushing prices to unprecedented levels. On the other side of that market, Kinder and drillers such as Comstock Resources Inc. reaped fat profits.Investors and analysts will be closely watching for similar positive surprises among Kinder’s pipeline-sector peers as they disclose first-quarter results in coming weeks.“Our storage assets performed exceptionally well, allowing us to deliver gas into the market throughout the storm,” said Chief Executive Officer Steve Kean. “These storage withdrawals, along with gas we purchased before and during the event, enabled us to deliver significant volumes of gas at contractual or prevailing prices.”RamificationsMuch of the extra gas Kinder sold went to power generators whose normal suppliers were shut down or blacked out as the catastrophe intensified, Kean said.The storm may have long-term ramifications for Kinder if costumers pay up to guarantee uninterrupted gas deliveries, which in turn would elevate the value of the company’s conduits and storage facilities, Moreen said in an interview.Peers such as Energy Transfer LP also may be poised to show hefty profits from the disaster. The units jumped as much as 3.3% to the highest since March 15.
