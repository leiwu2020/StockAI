SafeAuto is an auto insurance carrier with a focus on state-minimum private passenger auto insurance and provides coverage options across 28 states. This acquisition broadens Allstate’s product and distribution footprint, the company said.



The transaction, which is likely to close at the end of Q3 is expected to be immediately accretive to Allstate’s earnings.



Peter Rendall, President, National General, Property and Casualty said, “SafeAuto will accelerate our strategy of offering affordable protection solutions by lowering costs and lead to higher growth.” Notably, National General is a subsidiary of Allstate. (See Allstate Corp stock analysis on TipRanks)



On May 10, Argus Research analyst Kevin Heal reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $155 (12.3% upside potential) from $125.



Heal highlighted Allstate’s “strong” ROE and underwriting performance coupled with its ability to raise prices, lower costs and grow policies. According to the analyst, Allstate stock has value as the environment for property and casualty insurers seems favorable.



Consensus among analysts is that Allstate is a Moderate Buy based on 7 Buys and 5 Holds. The average analyst price target of $135 implies the stock is almost fairly priced at current levels.



Shares have gained about 27.7% so far this year.

In January, Allstate reached a deal to sell a life business to Blackstone Group Inc. for $2.8 billion.Allstate has been adjusting its strategy to focus more on personal property-liability coverage, expanding its distribution with independent agents through a $4 billion agreement to buy National General Holdings Corp. that was completed this year. The two life-insurance divestitures will contribute to the estimated $4 billion net loss under generally accepted accounting principles, while also generating $1.7 billion of deployable capital, the company said.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“Allstate’s sale of the rest of its life and annuity unit is a positive, narrowing its focus to P&C, and we believe it should boost return on equity.”-- Matthew Palazola, senior industry analyst“This transaction has minimal impact on our strategy of increasing market share in personal property-liability and expanding protection solutions for customers,” Allstate Chief Financial Officer Mario Rizzo said in the statement. “Wilton Re is a trusted name with a history of excellent customer service and expert management of life-insurance and annuity portfolios.”Allstate also agreed to contribute $660 million of capital into the New York life business unit and then receive the $220 million payment from Wilton Re. Both the New York sale and the deal with Blackstone are expected to be completed in the second half of this year, Allstate said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ec29d1e2a4b7f9a614c278171d204e735b85c07cad43cc7f0597203574b5a4f2
