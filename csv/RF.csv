The deal, subject to certain regulatory and closing conditions, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021.



As of March 31, Regions Bank had $153 billion in assets, including $83 billion in loans. The deal is expected to be immediately accretive to the company’s net interest margins by 10 - 15 bps and to the efficiency ratio by 100 bps, but will be dilutive to EPS in 2022. (See Regions Financial stock analysis on TipRanks)



Scott Peters, senior executive VP and head of the Consumer Banking Group for Regions Bank said, “We have thoughtfully evaluated the home improvement point-of-sale lending space for a number of years, and we believe this is the right partner at the right time to deliver on our vision. EnerBank’s platform and skilled financial professionals, combined with the reach and experience of Regions’ Consumer Banking teams, will help us deepen relationships with clients while reaching new customers with convenient home improvement lending options.”



Following the news, Raymond James analyst Michael Rose reiterated a Buy rating on RF and said, “Management is assuming limited cost and no revenue synergies, which could be a source of upside from the transaction. This deal is similar to the Ascentium Capital deal that was announced last year and it helps advance Regions' strategy of deepening customer relationships through offering new products and capabilities.”



The Wall Street community is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 9 Buys, 6 Holds, and 1 Sell. The RF average analyst price target of $22.93 implies 2.6% upside potential to current levels. Shares have gained 40% year-to-date.

Net income increased to $642 million, or 63 cents a share, from $162 million, or 14 cents a share, in the year-ago period. The FactSet consensus for earnings per share was 48 cents. Total revenue grew 13.7% to $1.60 billion, topping the FactSet consensus of $1.55 billion. Net interest income increased 4.2% to $967 million but missed expectations of $987.5 million, while noninteret income rose 32.2% to $641 million to beat expectations of $565.7 million. The bank said net interest income was negatively impacted by lower loan balances and the remixing out of higher yielding consumer indirect categories. The bank declared $149 million in dividends during the quarter, but did not repurchase any shares. ""While we are all still dealing with the lingering effects of the pandemic, our ongoing conversations with customers reflect optimism about further economic recovery and growth,"" said Chief Executive John Turner.

Regions Financial’s (RF) 4Q earnings spiked 61% year-over-year to $0.61 per share and topped analysts’ expectations of $0.42 per share. The company's revenue of $1.6 billion exceeded consensus estimates of $1.55 billion and grew 11.7% year-over-year.The bank’s 4Q net interest margin (NIM), on a fully-taxable equivalent basis, declined to 3.13% from 3.39% in the year-ago period. At the end of the fourth quarter, average adjusted loans and leases increased 1.9% year-over-year, while average core deposits rose 26.7% year-over-year. The company said ""the overall allowance reduction resulted in a net $38 million benefit to the credit loss provision during the fourth quarter."" (See RF stock analysis on TipRanks).Following the 4Q results, Wedbush analyst Peter Winter maintained a Hold rating and a price target of $21 (18.4% upside potential) on the stock. The analyst said, “there will be challenges to generating positive operating leverage in 2021; which is the case for most banks. Net interest income projected to be down in 2021 due to a decline in average loans and margin pressure.” Winter added, “the ability to grow NII and the resulting margin has to come from loan growth, plus the timing of PPP [paycheck protection program] forgiveness. Loan growth will be challenging in 2021 due to several consumer loan portfolios in runoff mode and a decline in PPP loans.” Overall, the rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic on the stock. The Moderate Buy analyst consensus is based on 9 Buys, 6 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $19 implies upside potential of about 7.1% to current levels. Shares have gained about 14.3% over the past year.Furthermore, TipRanks data shows that financial bloggers have a bullish call on the stock.Related News:Ally Financial Crushes 4Q Estimates Driven By Lower ProvisionsKansas City Sees Double-Digit Sales Growth In 2021Union Pacific Slips 5% On Weak 4Q Freight Revenues",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=345e72fd7cef4b723ab936bf5915a7fee9f911e9df301047589819d3abb5b79d
