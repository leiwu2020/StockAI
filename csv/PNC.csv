The company offers information processing, loan servicing, estate planning, wealth management and asset management services.



Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) stood at $4.50, beating the Street’s estimates of $3.12. (See PNC stock chart on TipRanks)



Total revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $4.67 billion, surpassing analysts’ expectations of $4.39 billion. Net interest income grew 10% to $2.6 billion, and noninterest income rose 11% to $2.1 billion.



The company completed the acquisition of BBVA USA Bancshares on June 1, and expects to incur merger and integration-related costs of $980 million. Most of this cost will be incurred this year, with the conversion of systems, branches and customers likely to take place in October.



KBW analyst David Konrad recently initiated coverage on the stock with a Hold rating and a price target of $193 (3.2% upside potential). 



In a research note to investors, the analyst said despite recent volatility and uncertainty regarding the macro reflation trade, he was constructive on large-cap banks due to expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term rates.



Overall, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 9 Buys and 8 Holds. The average PNC Financial price target of $204.25 implies 9.2% upside potential. The company’s shares have gained 81% over the past year.



According to TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, PNC scores a 9 out of 10, suggesting that the stock is likely to outperform market averages.

The approval included the green light from the Board of Governor of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as well as Banking departments of the States of Alabama and Texas. Upon closure of the acquisition, which is expected on June 1, PNC Financial will become the fifth-largest commercial bank in the U.S. with assets of more than $560 billion. PNC Financial Chairman, President, and CEO William S. Demchak said, “We are pleased to have received regulatory approval of our acquisition that will accelerate our growth trajectory and drive long-term shareholder value.” (See PNC Financial stock analysis on TipRanks) Demchak added, “With common cultures and values and a shared commitment to our customers, employees, and communities, we look forward to bringing PNC’s industry-leading technology and innovative products and services to new markets and clients.” On May 6, Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and raised the price target to $230 (15.4% upside potential) from $197. Mayo highlighted expected benefits from the BBVA USA acquisition for the upward target price revision and believes the transaction is “one of the most advantageous purchase prices since the GFC.” Consensus among analysts is that PNC Financial is a Moderate Buy based on 7 Buys and 8 Holds. The average analyst price target of $196.07 implies the stock is fairly priced at current levels. Shares have gained 91.6% over the past year.
