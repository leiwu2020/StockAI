(TJX) reported outstanding Q1 FY22 results despite temporary store closures for part of the quarter. TJX is a leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the United States and internationally. Net sales for the quarter were up 129% at $10.09 billion and surpassed the Street’s estimates of $8.38 billion. Earnings stood at $0.44 per share compared to a loss of $0.74 per share in the prior-year quarter. The company’s reported earnings beat the Street’s estimates of $0.28 per share. However, shares of the company fell 5.2% to close at $67.38 on May 19. The company’s overall open-only comp sales increased 16% year-over-year. Open-only comp sales is a measure of increase/decrease in sales for a comparable number of days the stores remain open in the same quarters for both Fiscal 2022 and 2021. The company ended the quarter with 4,639 stores (including temporarily closed stores) and a square footage increase of 1% compared to the prior quarter. (See TJX Companies stock analysis on TipRanks) Commenting on the results, Ernie Herrman, CEO and President of TJX said, “As we start the second quarter, overall open-only comp store sales trends remain similar to the first quarter. While the environment remains uncertain, particularly internationally, we are convinced we are strongly positioned as we emerge from this health crisis. Looking ahead, we see numerous opportunities to capture additional market share around the world and are excited about the runway for growth we see for TJX.” Owing to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the company is not giving any guidance. The company forecasts its stores to be closed for around 3% of the upcoming quarter. In April, the company reduced its debt by $750 million and expects further debt reduction of $2 billion during the year. Following the Q1 FY22 results, Guggenheim analyst Robert Drbul maintained a Buy rating on the stock and lifted the price target to $80, which implies 18.7% upside potential to current levels. “We are raising our estimates to reflect the upside in 1Q and our favorable outlook for TJX and off-price… For off-price overall, we see several favorable secular tailwinds over the long-term, as well as near-term benefits from store reopening’s and a favorable outlook for apparel spend in particular in coming months as consumers to look to refresh their wardrobes post COVID,” Drbul said. Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 11 Buys and 3 Holds. The average analyst price target stands at $78.71 and implies upside potential of 17.1% to current levels. Shares have gained 32.5% over the past year. TJX scores a 9 out of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

Looking ahead, we see numerous opportunities to capture additional market share around the world and are excited about the runway for growth we see for TJX.""Owing to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the company is not giving any guidance. The company forecasts its stores to be closed for around 3% of the upcoming quarter.In April, the company reduced its debt by $750 million and expects further debt reduction of $2 billion during the year.Following the Q1 FY22 results, Guggenheim analyst Robert Drbul maintained a Buy rating on the stock and lifted the price target to $80, which implies 18.7% upside potential to current levels.“We are raising our estimates to reflect the upside in 1Q and our favorable outlook for TJX and off-price... For off-price overall, we see several favorable secular tailwinds over the long-term, as well as near-term benefits from store reopening’s and a favorable outlook for apparel spend in particular in coming months as consumers to look to refresh their wardrobes post COVID,” Drbul said.Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 11 Buys and 3 Holds. The average analyst price target stands at $78.71 and implies upside potential of 17.1% to current levels. Shares have gained 32.5% over the past year.TJX scores a 9 out of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.Related News:Keysight Technologies Beats Analyst Expectations in Q2Pentair Expands National Footprint With Ken’s Beverage AcquisitionAdvanced Micro to Buy Back $4B in Stock; Shares Jump 2.4%",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4f681a613e6628e5c74e3ee015a999306a4da60a10b94e76b912b5f045ad427f

However, many made strong recoveries on the day and stocks rallied off the lows. Let’s look at a few top stock trades for Thursday. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Ethereum (ETH-USD) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) had been on a powerful rally not that long ago. However, it’s been under pressure since topping out earlier this month and then finally broke down on Wednesday. At the session low, Ethereum was down 37% today! However, from the lows, it’s actually up 40%, curbing its one-day losses to “just” 23% at the moment. The volatility has been wild, to say the least.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Now back above the 50-day and 10-week moving averages, bulls need to see Ethereum hold above these measures. At the very least, it has to hold above $2,550. If ETH loses the $2,500 mark, we can’t rule out a return to this week’s low. Luckily, shares caught a bounce right where we had the breakout marked, near $2,000. 7 High Quality Industrial Stocks to Buy Now On the upside, however, let’s see how Ethereum does on a test of its 10-day moving average. Above it could put the $3,500 mark and the 21-day moving average in play. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: AMD (AMD) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been range bound since last summer, although $74 continues to hold as support. On the upside, we want to see a rally back to $80, where AMD stock will find its 10-week and 50-week moving averages. Above these measures puts the 21-week on the table, followed by resistance at $88. On a break below last week’s low at $72.50, it’s possible we see a move lower. In that scenario, keep an eye on the 21-month moving average. If for some reason AMD stock breaks below that measure, the $60 breakout level could be in play. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Target (TGT) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider While other retailers have struggled despite strong earnings results, Target (NYSE:TGT) is doing quite well. Shares are pushing higher on Wednesday, running into its prior highs. From here I’d love to see a push up to the 161.8% extension near $220. Above that puts the two-times range extension at $233 in play. 7 Blue-Chip Stocks Looking Better Than Ever On the downside, though, keep an eye on $210. Losing that mark likely puts it below the 10-day and 21-day moving averages, and puts the 10-week and 50-day moving averages on the table. For now, bulls are in control with this one. Top Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: TJX Companies (TJX) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Unlike Target, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) is not responding well to earnings. However, that’s not the end of the world, either. Shares are trading right down into the 21-week moving average, a measure that has been support all year. If it holds, look to see if TJX stock can reclaim the 10-week. If it fails to do so, it’s possible we see a retest of the pre-coronavirus highs near $65, with more support sitting in the low $60s. Back above $71, and TJX stock could retest the all-time highs. Top Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: JD.com (JD) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) was trading really well coming into 2021, but like other growth stocks, it has struggled mightily since topping out in mid-February. After cascading lower, JD stock quickly saw its short-term moving averages turn from support to resistance, while it failed to reclaim $85. This combination should have kept bulls out of the name. Then it failed to hold the $78 to $79 area and 50-week moving average, which also turned to resistance. Are you sensing a pattern? Now trying to hold last week’s low near $66.50, let’s navigate this one. On the upside, see how JD stock does on a retest of the $77 to $80 area, if it can get there. There it finds current resistance, but it also finds the 10-day, 10-month and 50-week moving averages. A close below $66.50 likely puts the 21-month moving average and the $60 area in play.

And of course, he has more plans in the works, like the infrastructure plan. Investors are trying to figure out which companies will benefit. It’s important to recognize that President Biden’s policies will also have adverse impacts on some businesses. Perhaps one of the biggest impacts could be the support of unions. With growing concerns about inflation, unions may see a resurgence — and this could put pressure on the profits for Corporate America. There are various studies that have looked at how labor unions can impact the bottom line. For example, there was one – from St. Francis Xavier University professor Hatem Ghouma, King Saud University professor Abdullah Aldahmesh and Hamdi Ben-Nasr – that analyzed data from 1984-2013.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The outcome? Well, the influence of labor unions can lead to a “stock price crash risk”! 7 Great Stocks to Buy Under $10 So if President Biden’s actions lead to more union activity, which companies could be negatively impacted? Let’s take a look at seven: Target (NYSE:TGT) TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) Macy’s (NYSE:M) Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Stocks Watching Biden Administration’s Impact: Target (TGT) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Last year was particularly strong for Target as the novel corona virus spurred a big increase in consumer spending there. Comparable sales growth was 19.3% and there was a $9.3 billion improvement in marketshare. In a show of appreciation to the hard work of its employees, Target did provide a $500 bonus for its hourly workers. The minimum wage was also set to $15 per hour. But there could still be pressure from unions. For example, a Target warehouse center in New Jersey has indicated an intention to unionize. Let’s face it, such jobs can be so stressful. But of course, the warehouse part of the business has become a major source of profits for Target because of the importance of ecommerce. It’s not clear how many employees are in these facilities – but the headcount is likely growing. As for the total base across the company, it’s about 368,000. TJX Companies (TJX) Source: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.com TJX Companies has been effective in navigating the impact of the novel coronavirus. During the fourth quarter, the open-only comp store sales were off only about 3%. The company has also been able to maintain robust profitability. It certainly helps that the company is highly disciplined with its costs. It’s all a part of the low-price model. 7 Big Names That Could Be the Next Tesla But this could make it vulnerable to the pro-union focus of President Biden. Note that TJX is a fairly large organization with about 320,000 employees. And a union drive could really have a material impact on margins. Macy’s (M) Source: digitalreflections / Shutterstock.com Even with the cost cutting and unloading of stores, Macy’s still has a large employee base. It’s around 75,000. Since Macy’s has been around for decades, the company is unionized, but this represents a fairly small part of the workforce. But if it gets easier to expand on this — such as with the policies of President Biden — the impact could mean a squeeze on the bottom line. After all, Macy’s still must deal with the secular trends to ecommerce, battling giants like Amazon. And while the company has been making investments in its digital offerings, they have still not been enough to reverse the pressures on revenues. Tesla (TSLA) Source: Grisha Bruev / Shutterstock.com The auto industry has historically been heavily unionized. But Tesla has been able to buck that trend. Hey, there is little doubt that the company’s cofounder and CEO Elon Musk is no fan of unions. Keep in mind that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) recently ruled that he violated the labor laws by firing a union activist in 2018. It was actually in regard to the following tweet: “Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing?” One of the consequences of the NLRB action is that Tesla will have to amend its confidentiality agreements to allow its employees to freely talk with the media about their labor situations. The company will also have to provide notices about their labor rights. 7 Monthly Dividend Stocks That Pay the Bills Tesla has over 70,000 employees – and the headcount is growing at a rapid clip. So given that United Autoworkers has a lot of power and may be emboldened by President Biden, there could be more unionization efforts at the company. Still, Biden’s ambitious electric vehicle initiatives could provide tailwinds for TSLA stock at the same time. Darden Restaurants (DRI) Source: Shutterstock The restaurant business is tough. There is wide-spread competition and, of course, the labor costs are substantial — as is the turnover rate. Thus, if there is more unionization, the impact could be significant. One of the largest restaurant operators in the U.S. is Darden Restaurants. The company has over 175,000 employees and operates chains like Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Yard House and Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen. Yet it is taking some proactive steps to head off the efforts of unions. For example, Darden Restaurants recently set aside $17 million in bonuses and increased the minimum hourly pay $10. However, in light of Biden’s plans, this may not prove to be enough. Keep in mind that there is a growing movement in the restaurant industry to “Fight for $15” for the minimum wage and Darden Restaurants has definitely been a target of this. Alphabet (GOOGL) Source: Benny Marty / Shutterstock.com There are currently more than 800 members of the Alphabet Workers Union, which is associated with the Communications Workers of America Local 1400. Even though the union is fairly small, it may be a sign of more unionization to come. But, interestingly enough, the focus is not on wages. Alphabet is known for being competitive in regards to compensation. The reality is that it’s tough to attract and retain high level technical talent. But there is still likely to be an effect. The reason is that employees at large tech companies are mindful of their responsibilities and impact on society. There are potential threats with AI (Artificial Intelligence) and other new technologies. 7 Cheap Stocks with Growing Tailwinds The issue for a company like Alphabet is that its business model is often at odds with such things as privacy. In other words, if unions become more prevalent, it could be tougher for the company to monetize its platforms. Amazon (AMZN) Source: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has supported President Biden’s infrastructure plan — even the proposed corporate tax increases. Yet he may not be as keen about Biden’s support for unions. And this should come as no surprise. Keep in mind that the company has over one million employees. Something else: employees at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, recently voted against unionizing. Although this may bode well for AMZN shareholders in the short-term, the media attention that this vote garnered could engender other union efforts across the company and corporate America more broadly. So unionization may yet pose a headwind to Amazon, and this could present a growing challenge to the stock.
