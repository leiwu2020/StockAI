Kessler said, “After a thorough review, we concluded Perrigo does not have sufficient scale in its Latin American businesses… As the path to improving margins in these regions would be further dilutive for the foreseeable future, the decision was made to exit these businesses.” (See Perrigo stock analysis on TipRanks) Kessler added, “We are pleased to have reached an agreement with Advent and look forward to ensuring a seamless transition.” The divested units generated $85 million in revenue in Fiscal 2020.

company,1620730065,Perrigo shares down 1.6% premarket as earnings fall short of estimates,67743267,,PRGO,Yahoo,"Perrigo Co. Plc share slid 1.6% in premarket trade Tuesday, after the Dublin-based provider of consumer self-care products posted weaker-than-expected earnings for its first quarter. The company said it had net income of $3 million, or 2 cents a share, in the quarter, down from $58 million, or 42 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, adjusted per-share earnings came to 50 cents, below the 57 cents FactSet consensus. Sales fell to $1.010 billion from $1.083 billion, also below the $1.025 billion FactSet consensus. Perrigo has spent the past two years changing from a healthcare company to a consumer self-care company and announced the sale of its generic drug business on March 1. That deal is expected to generate about $2 billion in cash. ""We have made the necessary investments in infrastructure, capabilities, talent and capacity, and as a result have restored Perrigo to growth, all while weathering the storm of a horrific global pandemic,"" Chief Executive Murray S. Kessler said in a statement. Earnings and sales declines were due to consumer pantry loading a year ago and a historically weak cough and cold season this year, both caused by COVID-19, he said. ""Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we are encouraged to see the recent increases in retail store foot traffic, more people traveling again, and children returning to school in the fall,"" he said. The company is still expecting fiscal 2021 adjusted EPS to range from $2.50 to $2.70, compared with a FactSet consensus of $2.62. Shares have fallen 3.6% in the year through Monday, while the S&P 500 has gained 11.5%.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f6ac8b0b7b8722ffa9566b82de9b41e8a3951d65e00ecb04f9982951ed318c89

Other featured articles show which food stocks are worth bite and which real estate stocks have room to run. Also, see the prospects for a high-profile biotech, a logistics play, a video streaming leader and more. Cover story ""This Bull Market Is Far From Over, Pros Say. Where They're Investing Now"" by Nicholas Jasinski covers an exclusive Barron's survey, which found that two-thirds of Big Money managers are now bullish on stocks. That is up from a little more than half in the fall. Their picks range from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) to Zoom Video Communications Inc (NYSE: ZM). Andrew Bary's ""Food Stocks Worth Filling Up On"" suggests that, with their cheap valuations and generous yields, packaged-food giants such as Hershey Co (NYSE: HSY) and Kellogg Company (NYSE: K) offer an appetizing alternative to bonds. They have better growth prospects than many expect too, says the article. In ""Buy Moderna Stock. It's More Than a One-Hit Wonder,"" Josh Nathan-Kazis discusses how vaccine maker Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA), now one of the best-known biotechs in the world, has the cash and the messenger RNA platform to drive years of strong growth. Find out why Barron's believes that, for a biotech, the stock is inexpensive. By splitting the company in two parts, XPO Logistics Inc (NYSE: XPO) hopes to unlock value in its shipping business while creating new value with GXO Logistics as a play on the trend toward outsourced logistics, according to ""XPO Logistics Is Worth More Than the Sum of Its Parts"" by Al Root. Find out why this stock is a Barron's pick ahead of the split. In Teresa Rivas' ""Perrigo Stock Has Been Broken for a Long Time. It's Time for a Turnaround,"" discover how, at its peak in 2015, Perrigo Company PLC (NYSE: PRGO) was worth more than $28 billion, and now the Dublin-based generic pharmaceuticals company finally is taking steps to turn itself around. ""Bill Miller Is Roaring Back With Amazon, Bitcoin, and GM"" by William Green points out that this former Legg Mason investing star has had renewed success, and a lot of his recent performance has come from a few spectacular investment plays, such as Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and General Motors Company (NYSE: GM). See also: Benzinga's Bulls And Bears Of The Week: Apple, Boeing, Intel, Netflix, Tesla And More The Nifty Fifty of the 1960s and 1970s were the FAANG stocks of their day. So says Kenneth G. Pringle's ""The FAANG Stocks Could Fall, if History Is Any Guide."" See whether Barron's thinks Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and the rest of the FAANGs will prove equally vulnerable. In ""How Netflix Could Become a Surprise Reopening Play,"" Eric J. Savitz reveals why, with Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) shares down by double digits from their recent high, bulls argue that the streaming giant's real growth is still to come. This though movie theaters, sports leagues, bars, gyms, schools, restaurants, offices and more get back to business. Ben Levisohn's ""Why Real Estate Stocks Still Have Room to Run"" argues that real estate investment trusts (REITs) are among this year's better performers due to the reopening trade. See why Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE: SPG) and others look cheap and could even offer some protection from rising inflation.

Perrigo also announced that shareholders on the company's books on or before March 12, 2021 are entitled to the dividend. The stock will then go ex-dividend 1 business day(s) before the record date. Perrigo has an ex-dividend date planned for March 11, 2021. The company's current dividend payout sits at $0.24. That equates to a dividend yield of 2.28% at current price levels. The Significance Of Ex-Dividend Dates An ex-dividend date signals when a company's shares cease to trade with its current dividend payout. There is a small intermission period before the company announces a new dividend. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Typically, companies will announce and implement new dividend yields on a quarterly basis. Perrigo's Dividend Payouts And Yields Over the past year, Perrigo has seen its dividend payouts and yields climb upward overall. Last year (February 27, 2020), the company's payout sat at $0.23, which has since increased by $0.01. Perrigo's dividend yield last year was 1.56%, which has since grown by 0.72%. Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market. Click here to find details on Perrigo's previous dividends.
