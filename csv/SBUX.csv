The burger and milkshake chain is teaming up with executive chef Sarah Grueneberg to serve its fans in Chicago special menu items. Proceeds from the offering will go towards Inspiration Kitchens, a nonprofit that trains homeless people in Chicago for a career in the food industry. (See Shake Shack stock analysis on TipRanks)



Additionally, the burger and milkshake chain plans to open a new outlet in Montgomery County, Maryland. According to Bethesda Magazine, the new retail outlet should be up and running in 2022.



Shake Shack has already submitted plans to the city as it seeks to open a freestanding restaurant next to Starbucks (SBUX). The restaurant chain opened its first outlet in Montgomery in 2018. Earlier this month, it announced plans to add a location in the food court of the Westfield Montgomery Mall. (See Starbucks stock analysis on TipRanks)



Piper Sandler analyst Nicole Miller Regan maintains a Buy rating on SHAK stock and a $131 price target, implying 32.11% upside potential to current levels. Moreover, according to the analyst, the stock is undervalued, considering its pipeline for growth.



While Shake Shack is not immune to labor pressures in the industry, Regan believes investments on the team, diversity equity, and inclusions are “long-term strategic differentiators.”



Consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 4 Buys, 8 Holds, and 2 Sells. The average analyst Shake Shack price target of $103.58 implies 4.46% upside potential to current levels.



SHAK scores 3 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock could underperform market expectations.

The coffee chain filed for the stadium naming rights with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on June 2.



The company said in the filing that it intends to use its name to promote business, sports, and entertainment events. However, the company declined to discuss its plans beyond the filing, according to the report.



If Starbucks secures the approval for the stadium naming rights, it would join corporations such as Amazon (AMZN), FedEx (FDX), and Barclays (BCS) that have used their brands on stadiums and arenas. (See Starbucks stock analysis on TipRanks)



Companies put their names on sports venues to drive brand awareness and secure fan loyalty. But stadium sponsorship does not come cheap. For example, e-commerce and cloud computing provider Amazon spent anywhere between $300 million and $400 million last year for the rights to name a Seattle arena Climate Pledge Arena, according to the CNBC report.



BMO Capital analyst Andrew Strelzik reiterated a Buy rating on Starbucks stock and raised the price target to $125 from $120. The analyst’s new price target implies 11.05% upside potential. 



Strelzik observed that Starbucks' sales should continue to improve even though margin targets still look conservative. The analyst noted a recovery in Starbucks’ U.S. business where two-year comps rose 6% above pre-pandemic levels. However, the international business is still sluggish, with sales in places like China falling short of expectations. 



Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 14 Buys and 10 Holds. The Starbucks average analyst price target of $125.09 implies 11.13% upside potential to current levels.



SBUX scores a 9 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.
