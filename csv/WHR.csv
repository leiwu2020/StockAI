The cloud partnership builds on a strategic alliance that began in 2014 with Whirlpool rolling out Google Workspace to its employees.



As part of the expanded collaboration, Whirlpool has deployed its company-wide applications and SAP environment on Google Cloud.



The cloud giant will also offer Whirlpool cloud capabilities powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, ideal for enhancing its digital revolution. (See Alphabet stock analysis on TipRanks).



“Whirlpool Corp. is creating a foundation for future growth with a forward-looking, cloud-first approach to its critical SAP systems, while maintaining a strong commitment to sustainability... We’re proud to expand our strategic collaboration with Whirlpool and will continue to support the company’s digital transformation across all of its global operations,” said Google Cloud’s President Rob Enslin



Whirlpool settled on Google Cloud because it is the cleanest in the industry, running 100% on renewable energy. (See Whirlpool stock analysis on TipRanks).



On May 10, Citigroup analyst Jason Bazinet downgraded the stock to a Hold from a Buy. The analyst has a $2,415 price target on the stock implying 2.87% upside potential to current levels.



Bazinet told investors that looking ahead, he has three main concerns about the stock. “First, among the top 10 Internet ad firms, in absolute dollar terms, sell side expects ~2x the annual growth from ’21 to ’25 versus ’18 to ’20. Second, many investors believe ad intensity per dollar of economic activity is rising. We see little evidence of this. Third, even if the sell side estimates are right, growth will likely decelerate after 2Q21 (on tougher comps). Historically, that usually isn’t bullish for multiples.”



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 27 Buys and 2 Holds. The average analyst price target of $2,785.97 implies 18.67% upside potential to current levels.



GOOGL scores an 8 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score tool, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

Sundial Growers (SNDL), a licensed cannabis producer was the most actively traded stock in pre-market trading as the company stands to benefit from the US House of Representatives’ vote in favour of legislation that seeks to allow banks to legally serve cannabis producers. Akers Biosciences (AKER) was the biggest gainer in pre-market trading, up by 42.2% at the time of writing. There was no fundamental news explaining the gain in the stock price. However, the company was listed on the NASDAQ yesterday following last week’s approval by shareholders of the merger with AKER. Caci International (CACI) was the biggest laggard dropping 17% in the pre-market despite being awarded a $376 million contract by the NGA. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s (NVDA) proposed $40 billion acquisition of Cambridge-based Arm faces scrutiny from the UK Government. On Monday, the UK’s Secretary of State issued an intervention notice on behalf of the UK Government citing national security interests.

The company reported a 5% year-on-year increase in net revenues of $9 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $8.6 billion and 1Q non-GAAP EPS of $0.55 that came in ahead of consensus estimates of $0.50. Coca-Cola’s Chairman and CEO, James Quincey said, “We remain focused on emerging stronger and executing against our growth accelerators during the recovery phase. We are pleased with the progress we are making. We are encouraged by improvements in our business, especially in markets where vaccine availability is increasing and economies are opening up, and we remain confident in our full year guidance.” Whirlpool Corp. (WHR) announced a share buyback program of $2 billion and also hiked its quarterly dividend by $0.15 to $1.40 per share. The dividend is payable on June 15 to shareholders of record on May 21.

Analysts expect Whirlpool to report earnings per share of $5.02 on revenue of $4.78 billion. On April 19, Raymond James analyst Sam Darkatsh reiterated a Hold rating on the stock but did not assign any price target. Darkatsh thinks the “current robust demand level is unsustainable” and rising raw material prices should be a substantial headwind in fiscal 2022. For 1Q, Darkatsh estimates 19% year-on-year top-line growth for the company. Consensus on the street is that Whirlpool is a Moderate Buy based on 1 Buy and 3 Holds. The average analyst price target of $231 implies the stock is fairly priced. Shares have gained about 143% over the past year.
