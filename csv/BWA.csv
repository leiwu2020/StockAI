AKASOL designs and manufactures customizable lithium-ion battery systems for buses, commercial, rail, and industrial vehicles, as well as for ships and boats.



The company has paid approximately €648 million from its current cash balances to settle the tender offer. The company expects to provide more details on the acquisition when it reports its second-quarter earnings on August 4.



The acquisition is in line with BorgWarner’s electrification strategy and will strengthen the company’s capabilities in the commercial vehicle and industrial electrification markets. The deal will further enhance BorgWarner’s offerings in the off-highway battery systems business.



BorgWarner CEO Frederic Lissalde said, “We are excited to add AKASOL's innovative products, capabilities and team to BorgWarner as we advance our plan to grow our electric vehicle businesses to approximately 45% of total revenues by 2030 under Project Charging Forward.”



He further added, ""Our companies share a commitment to delivering innovative, environmentally friendly solutions to our global customers, and together, we'll be even better positioned to do just that.” (See BorgWarner stock analysis on TipRanks)



On June 2, Oppenheimer analyst Noah Kaye reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $56 price target. This implies 2.9% upside potential to current levels.



Kaye said, “We note that Hyundai, similar to multiple North American and European OEMs, recently unveiled a dedicated BEV platform (e-GMP) to support design flexibility, standardization and manufacturing competitiveness. We believe this award showcases BWA's ability to participate in major OEMs' EV commercialization plans with differentiated solutions.”



The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 8 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $54.58 implies that shares are fully valued at current levels. Shares have increased 38.8% over the past six months.



BorgWarner scores a 4 of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock is likely to perform in line with market averages.

BorgWarner Inc. (BWA), a leading auto parts and equipment solutions provider based in the U.S., might just bring back those investors. The company is still cheaply valued in the market, but it has been aggressively expanding into the EV industry. Government authorities around the world are actively pushing for zero-emission goals, and EVs are expected to play a major role in helping to achieve this objective. For this reason, policymakers have introduced tax subsidies for electric vehicles. This favorable macroeconomic environment could suggest that the EV industry is primed for exponential growth in the next decade. BorgWarner’s Strategy At its core, BorgWarner is an original equipment manufacturer that has historically focused on selling clutches and turbochargers. The company is now transforming its business model to prioritize EV engines and equipment, in an attempt to tap into the massive growth opportunity this industry presents. Last year, revenue from EVs accounted for less than 3% of total revenue, but BorgWarner has guided for $10 billion in EV revenue by 2030, or approximately 45% of total revenue. (See BorgWarner stock analysis on TipRanks) The strategy of the company focuses on an M&A model. The company has spent billions of dollars to acquire third-party equipment manufacturing companies to gain market share in the EV industry, with it snapping up four names since 2015. In addition to these investments, BorgWarner’s strong ties with Ford (F) and Volkswagen (VWAGY) will help earnings growth in the future, as both legacy automakers have pledged to invest billions of dollars through 2025 to launch EVs. U.S. EV Market Is Undergoing A Transformation In Europe, EVs accounted for 14% of the total passenger vehicles sold in December 2020, which was a fresh high. Inclusive of plug-in hybrids that use fossil fuel as a secondary option, the penetration of EVs was as high as 23% last December. BorgWarner has a strong presence in Europe because of its relationship with Volkswagen, and Europe accounted for 35% of its 2020 revenue. Going by the increasing adoption of EVs in Europe and the progress Volkswagen has made in penetrating this all-important market, BorgWarner seems well-positioned to grow its earnings in Europe. The U.S., in contrast, has been slower to embrace EVs than Europe and China. In 2020, EVs accounted for just 1.8% of new light vehicle registrations in the country, which was a record high. A deep dive into consumer preferences in the country shows that a lack of available options for EV trucks and SUVs is behind this slow adoption. According to data from Forbes, the Ford F-Series was the top-selling vehicle in the U.S. in 2020, followed by Chevrolet Silverado and Ram Pickup. In fact, 8 out of 10 top-selling vehicles last year were SUVs or pickup trucks, which confirms Americans’ affinity for this vehicle category. 2021 is bound to be a transformational year for the U.S. automobile industry, as many automakers have pledged to introduce EV trucks and SUVs later this year. That is likely to trigger a multi-year growth phase in EV adoption in the country. Some noteworthy trucks to look out for in 2021 and 2022 include the Tesla Cybertruck and the Rivian R1T. Many EV trucks are expected to be available in the market by the fourth quarter of this year, presenting new opportunities for BorgWarner. Wall Street’s Take BorgWarner stock collapsed in March 2020 along with the broader market sell-off, but the stock has recovered sharply in the last 12 months by appreciating 81%. With an average analyst target price of $51.77, the upside potential lands at 7%. According to TipRanks' consensus breakdown, BWA is a Moderate Buy, with 8 Buy ratings, 5 Hold ratings, and 1 Sell rating. Takeaway The company’s push to expand into the EV industry is likely to aid not only earnings growth, but also valuation multiples. Investor sentiment towards this industry is positive, so once the company announces new business partnerships with EV manufacturers to supply equipment, the stock is likely to attract premium valuation multiples. Considering this possibility, it would be reasonable to conclude that BorgWarner stock is well-positioned to reach new highs in the coming years.

Morgan Says These 2 Stocks Could Surge at Least 30% From Current Levels,66379404,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LzV63kUB4nL.U2mD1XbDIQ--~B/aD00NTQ7dz0xMDI0O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/tipranks_452/74b66bf4866b270be434f7c00be7dbc8,BWA,Yahoo,"In a volatile market environment, with stocks getting buffeted about by a variety of conflicting forces, investors are looking to the expert commentators for some guidance. Covering the macro situation from banking giant JPMorgan, quant strategist Marko Kolanovic believes that we’re in for continued gains in stocks. Kolanovic doesn’t dismiss the recent dips in the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ; rather, he sees them as temporary. Kolanovic points out that we’re approaching the end of Q1 and will soon see the first earnings reports of 2021. He expects that to build momentum for stocks going into the summer, boosting the market indexes and keeping inflation at a steady state with bond yields stabilizing. Kolanovic has set a 4,400 year-end price target for the S&P 500, which suggests ~13% growth in the market’s benchmark index. Taking Kolanovic’s outlook to heart, J.P. Morgan analysts are offering up concrete recommendations, pointing to two names that look compelling. As the firm’s analysts are forecasting at least 30% upside potential for each, we used TipRanks’ database to dig a bit deeper. BorgWarner, Inc. (BWA) The first JPM pick we're looking at is BorgWarner, a major manufacturer of drivetrain components, especially transmissions and air management systems, which has long been a stalwart of Detroit’s automotive industry. The company has, in recent years, been a leader in the development of powertrains and motors for electric vehicles, and is committed to accelerating that development. The company announced this week that it intends to expand its EV revenues to 45% of the company total by 2030. The company’s plan, called Charging Forward, would see a focus on developing componentry for electric commercial vehicles while optimizing the combustion portfolio, and scaling the EV business up to deliver the projected higher demand. Management expects to maintain BorgWarner’s high margin performance while generating a strong free cash flow. Current performance gives BorgWarner a solid foundation for its ambitious EV plans. The company saw a strong beat in 4Q20 on several key metrics. BWA reported revenues of $3.93 billion, a 53% gain year-over-year. EPS came in at $1.52, up from $1.06 in the year-ago quarter. Turning to full-year numbers, 2020 ended with BWA showing $10.17 billion at the top line, about equal to last year’s total. 2020 earnings were down, to $2.34 from $3.61 in 2019. Despite the lower earnings, BWA’s cash position improved in 2020. Free cash flow was $743 million for the year, and the company increased its cash and cash equivalent holdings by $818 million year-over-year. Among the bulls is JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman who wrote: “Demand for BWA products is strong, driven by both consumer ‘pull’ and government ‘push’ elements, and we believe will only increase over time as the rising amount of vehicles in emerging markets upwardly pressures fuel prices. BWA already enjoys the second-highest margins in the sector, in part driven by the fact that many of the products it manufactures are of a highly engineered nature, leading to high technical barriers to entry and market concentration. Still, we expect the combination of rapid top-line growth and financial discipline to allow for top-tier operating margin expansion.” To this end, Brinkman rates BWA an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his $58 price target implies a potential upside of 33% for the coming year. (To watch Brinkman’s track record, click here) Brinkman is not an outlier in his bullish stance, but there is some division on Wall Street regarding BWA. The analyst consensus view is a Moderate Buy, based on 14 recent reviews breaking down to 8 Buys, 5 Holds and 1 Sell. The shares are priced at $43.70 and their $49.69 average price target suggests a one-year upside of ~14%. (See BWA stock analysis on TipRanks) Adobe, Inc. (ADBE) Shifting gears, we’ll move from automotive to software. Adobe is a name we’re all familiar with, and rightly so. The company created the PDF format, and among its product line-up are Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, among many, many others. In recent years, Adobe has shifted to a subscription SaaS model, offering its products as a bundle on Adobe Creative Cloud. Adobe saw gains last year, as its cloud-based model was well suited to 2020’s shift to remote work and telecommuting. The company’s fiscal 2020 revenues hit $12.8 billion, up nearly 14% from 2019, and growth has continued into its first quarter of fiscal 2021. The company reported $3.9 billion in Q1’s top line, a company record and up 26% year-over-year. EPS, at $2.61 per share, was up 33% yoy. That guidance was updated based on the Q1 results. Management sees the company bringing in $15.45 billion in total revenue for fiscal 2021, which would represent a 20% yoy increase from the published 2020 figure. Digital media, a major driver of the 2020 numbers, is expected to deliver 22% yoy growth and show annualized recurring revenue of $1.8 billion. Covering this stock for JPM is 5-star analyst Sterling Auty, who sees a clear path forward for Adobe. “When the economic cycle turns for the better companies tend to invest in solutions that will help drive revenue growth and that is exactly what the Adobe Experience Cloud, with its digital marketing solutions, can help customers achieve,” Auty noted. The analyst added, ""Over the years it is more common for Adobe to reiterate the full-year guidance after reporting the first-quarter earnings, so seeing the raise above just the first quarter upside for the full year numbers is a sign of incremental strength in our opinion. As a reminder, the stock has not done a lot since the start of September and this might be the catalyst to get it moving again."" In line with his bullish comments, Auty rates ADBE shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy). His $595 price target indicates his confidence in a 32% one-year upside. (To watch Auty’s track record, click here) Overall, Wall Street analysts are pretty well unified in their views on Adobe – the stock has 16 Buy reviews, against a single Hold, for a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. The shares are priced at $450.99, with an average price target, $559.82, suggesting an upside of ~24% by year’s end.

company,1614265970,Understanding BorgWarner's Ex-Dividend Date,66379441,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,BWA,Yahoo,"On February 11, 2021, BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) declared a dividend payable on March 15, 2021 to its shareholders. BorgWarner also announced that shareholders on the company's books on or before March 1, 2021 are entitled to the dividend. The stock will then go ex-dividend 1 business day(s) before the record date. The ex-dividend date for BorgWarner will be on February 26, 2021. The company's current dividend payout is at $0.17. That equates to a dividend yield of 1.56% at current price levels. What Is An Ex-Dividend Date? Ex-dividend dates signal when company shares cease to trade with their current dividend payouts. There is a small intermission period before companies announce new dividends. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Most ex-dividend dates operate on a quarterly basis. BorgWarner's Dividend Performance Over the past year, BorgWarner has seen its dividend payouts remain the same and its yields trend downward. Last year on February 28, 2020 the company's payout sat at $0.17, which has returned to its value today. BorgWarner's dividend yield last year was 1.96%, which has since decreased by 0.4%. Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market. To read more about BorgWarner click here.
