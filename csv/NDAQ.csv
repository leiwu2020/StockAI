The survey is based on interviews with 25 chief information officers and senior technology leaders of market infrastructure operators (MI) worldwide to understand their focus, priorities, and investments around the creation of their future technology platforms. With the COVID-19 pandemic acting as a stress test on capital markets infrastructure – exposing data flow, scaling, and operational challenges – the survey results uncover increasing demand to move to more agile technology, microservices, and data models. “For our survey, we wanted to examine how technology leaders of the world’s markets have navigated rapidly changing technological advancements in the face of modernization challenges,” said Lars Ottersgård, Executive Vice President and Head of Market Technology at Nasdaq. “The capital markets ecosystem experienced intense volatility and record high transaction volumes in 2020. In combination with a changing regulatory landscape, evolving market forces and emerging digital models, our research has shown technology leaders across the industry investing in cloud technology and data analytics specifically to future-proof infrastructure across both traditional and digital asset classes.” “The changing face of the capital markets at a time of accelerated technology innovation have many CIOs thinking about their technology estate and the platforms required to future-proof it,” said Brad Bailey, Research Director at Celent’s Capital Markets division. “The burden of technical debt and inefficient data processes is critical to their internal and external clients. Furthermore, the survey shows considerable differences in where digital change can occur most readily within the various lines of businesses and functional areas that market infrastructures run.” Additional key findings from the 2021 survey: MI CIOs plan to increase their investment in modern technology as they replatform core trading and post-trade systems. There will be a 45% increase in the number of MI providers with fully modernized technology stacks by 2025.65% of MI CIOs see cloud technology as a fundamental and expanding part of their software development. The increasing use of cloud technology and microservices is seen as a tool to add agility and to service partner and client demand. Researchers estimate a 27% increase in cloud-ready applications between 2021 and 2025.MI CIOs are actively modernizing their infrastructure. Now more than ever, CIOs are open to partner with third parties in accessing and provisioning technology and services. 31% of the surveyed CIOs will move more components to third party providers in the future.The majority of the surveyed MI CIOs see data distribution as an area to explore managed services. 96% of the surveyed CIOs report that they are either seriously considering investments in enhanced data analytics or already have projects underway in the area.

Puro.earth is the world´s first marketplace to offer industrial carbon removal instruments that are verifiable and tradable through an open, online platform. The platform already provides carbon removal services to some of the world’s leading corporations, including Microsoft and SEB. The partnership with Puro.earth will scale the marketplace to address a growing demand for carbon removal by corporations, as well as enable new carbon removal methodologies as technology evolves. The addition of Puro.earth’s marketplace capabilities to Nasdaq’s environmental, social, and governance (ESG)-focused technologies and workflow solutions gives Nasdaq’s corporate clients further resources to successfully achieve their ESG objectives. Fortum, a leading European energy company, will remain a minority owner and an important partner in the venture. “The addition of Puro.earth to our growing suite of innovative ESG products and services extends our strategy into an increasingly important area for our 4,000+ corporate clients worldwide,” said Bjørn Sibbern, Executive Vice President and President of European Markets at Nasdaq. “The partnership with Puro.earth will provide our global network of corporate clients access to a unique marketplace for carbon removal and will allow Puro.earth to scale its platform through the Nasdaq network and technology platform. We look forward to working together with the Puro.earth and Fortum teams to create a global, transparent and authenticated market for carbon removal.” Carbon removal is a process in which CO2 is physically captured from the atmosphere and stabilized into a durable storage. Carbon removal is expected to play a critical role in keeping global warming below 1.5C degrees. Puro.earth maintains a rigorous process to approve and verify its removal methodologies. Leveraging its robust experience maintaining quality and compliance standards on both the issuer and supplier side, Nasdaq will work with Puro.earth to further strengthen the governance around new methodologies by establishing an external advisory committee with representation from the industry, academia, buyside and suppliers. “This investment and strategic partnership with Nasdaq will enable us to realize our mission to support the transformation of the world’s economy to reward carbon negative emissions and help our customers reach their ambitious net-zero goals. So far we have seen the carbon removal industry take small steps, and with Nasdaq involved we have the potential to make much bigger strides”, said Antti Vihavainen, CEO of Puro.earth. Leading Northern European financial services group SEB is committed to supporting its customers in their sustainable transformation and to limit its own emissions. “To stop global warming, it is not enough to limit emissions, measures are also needed to remove carbon dioxide from the air,” said Joachim Alpen, Co-head of SEB’s division Large Corporates & Financial Institutions. “The market for carbon removals is still evolving. We appreciate initiatives to create economic drivers to accelerate carbon removal.” Puro.earth will remain an independent company and brand following the investment. Terms of the transaction have not been disclosed. With a rich history and experience in navigating the global ESG landscape, Nasdaq has become an established leader in corporate sustainability. The company engages with corporate clients, investors, regulators, influencers, employees and corporates to drive innovation and transparency.

Since last June, 145 S&P 500 companies have added at least one Black director, a “brisk” pace compared to past years, according to recruiter Russell Reynolds Associates. Latino board appointments at public companies quadrupled from a year ago, and women, for the first time, hold almost a third of all seats on the S&P 500. Only one major U.S. initial public offering debuted with an all-male board last year. “Ninety plus percent of every board search that we’ve been asked to execute in the last nine months has had a strong focus on diversity, especially ethnic diversity,” said Keith Meyer, the co-head of board and chief executive recruiting at Allegis Partners. A year ago, only around half of his clients asked about finding women and minority candidates, Meyer estimated. The momentum has been driven largely by controversial quotas, similar to the rule proposed by Nasdaq Inc. Late last year, the stock exchange announced a plan to require listed companies to have at least one female and one underrepresented director. Companies without such directors can stay on the exchange if they explain their lack of diversity.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will decide by August whether to approve Nasdaq’s proposal. Meanwhile, all companies based in the state of California will have to meet the same requirements starting at the end of this year. In addition, since July 1, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has refused to underwrite companies that don't have a certain level of board diversity. These constraints were front of mind for Carl Hull, chief executive of Maravai LifeSciences Holdings Inc. as the company prepared to go public last Summer. The four-member, all-male board had no choice but to diversify; the company is headquartered in San Diego, California and had chosen Goldman Sachs to underwrite its IPO. It was also seeking a listing on the Nasdaq exchange.Critics of quotas say they lower standards and give unfair advantages to people based on their race, ethnicity or gender. Working with Goldman and executive recruiter Heidrick & Struggles, in about three months Maravai found three qualified women to add to its roster: Anat Ashkenazi, chief financial officer at Eli Lilly & Co., Jessica Hopfield, a scientist and pharmaceutical industry advisor, and Susannah Gray, former CFO of Royalty Pharma. Maravai develops drugs and health therapies, including some technologies used in Covid vaccines, and all of these women had decades of experience in the medical sciences industry. Gray, who had never sat on a board before last year, now sits on four. “You get into that loop where if you haven’t been on a board you can’t get on a board,” she said. “Goldman broadened the aperture.” Traditionally, boards have been stacked with friends and family of founders, executives, and other directors. That pattern has kept them largely White and male, and needs to change if companies want to meet new mandates, said Ilana Wolfe, head of corporate board engagement at Goldman Sachs. “There’s real value in selecting someone you know and trust,” she said. “But when the only pool candidates you know and trust all look the same and likely have shared experiences and backgrounds, that’s not efficient for optimizing talent.” In the past year, Goldman has helped find 23 diverse directors for 21 companies, the bank said. Among those companies was Root Inc., a car insurance company. CEO Alex Timm had been trying and failing for more than a year to find diverse directors. The company is based in Ohio, which has no board quotas, but wanted Goldman Sachs underwrite its IPO last fall. The bank helped him find Jerri DeVard, former chief marketing officer at Home Depot who was already on the Under Armour Inc. board. This year DeVard also helped found the Black Executive CMO Alliance, a group of c-suite executives from companies such as Amazon and Netflix pushing for more Black executives in marketing roles. Often, boards look for certain credentials, like c-suite experience, in potential directors. Women and minorities are notoriously underrepresented in those roles, leading to their underrepresentation on boards. “The system was designed for majorities to succeed and not minorities,” said DeVard. “We’re not playing on a level playing field.” Both the MeToo movement and Black Lives Matter protests brought greater awareness to the discrimination women and minorities face that has kept them out of positions of power. But the push for board diversity is as much about improving governance by adding different kinds of thinkers to to the table. Hull said the new directors at Maravai LifeSciences have changed the dynamic and brought fresh new perspectives. In their second meeting early this year, the three women had different ideas about communication strategies than the veterans, Hull said.“All of us speak up,” Gray, one of the new directors, said. “There’s no sense that any of us were put on the board because conveniently we happen to have the right gender.”The fate of the Nasdaq rule remains unclear. The exchange said it got almost 85% support for the plan among the more than 200 comments submitted during the SEC’s comments period this winter. That included notes of approval from Facebook Inc. chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and U.S. Senators Catherine Cortez Masto and Kirsten Gillibrand. Newly confirmed SEC Chair Gary Gensler is exploring recommendations for company disclosures of board-diversity data. In addition, Congress is considering a law that would require companies to include board diversity in regulatory filings.Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee urged the SEC to reject the rule, arguing it’s not Nasdaq’s role to “act as an arbitrator of social policy or force a prescriptive one-size-fits-all solution upon markets.”When the proposal was announced in December, only about a quarter of Nasdaq-listed companies met the proposed standard. Even if the rule isn't approved, the face of corporate boards will continue to change.

These new index options are now listed on the Nasdaq PHLX options exchange, and are available on many trading platforms that support index options. The Nasdaq-100 is one of the world’s preeminent and increasingly popular large-cap growth indexes, with exposure to leading businesses that drive the economy across a broad swath of industries including technology, health care, and consumer staples. As the Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX) continues to outperform the market, the notional size of NDX index options often outsize the reach of individual investors. Nasdaq-100® Micro Index Options address this by representing 1/100th the full value of the Nasdaq-100 Index, providing investors with a lower notional entry point. This enables Main Street investors to mitigate risk and enhance the yield of the Nasdaq-100 with a new, cost-effective tradable instrument. “Option investor engagement is at an important inflection point, with newer participants embracing the options market like never before,” said Greg Ferrari, Vice President and Head of U.S. Options for Nasdaq. “The Nasdaq-100® Micro Index Options address this evolving demographic by providing individual investors with a more precise and manageable way to access innovative Nasdaq-100 companies. Our work continues to encourage broader participation in the market and helps investors recognize the benefits that exist when utilizing index options in a portfolio.” Upon initial launch, Nasdaq-100® Micro Index Options are available for monthly expirations, with weekly expirations set to launch later next month. Additional expiries, including long-term equity anticipation securities (LEAPS) as well as Monday and Wednesday weekly expiries, will be added per customer demand. Index options serve a valuable role for options investors, with the main benefits being cash-settlement, European-style expiration, and favorable tax treatment. The Nasdaq-100 Index landscape is one of the most liquid index ecosystems in the world and supports liquid futures, options, ETFs, ETF options, index options, index funds, variable and fixed insurance products, and structured products. In total, NDX gained in value by more than 40% last year, with the notional value of all financial instruments that follow the index exceeding $1 trillion.

The event will award Benzinga Listmakers, those top companies part of Benzinga’s Global Fintech Index, for their accomplishments innovating, as well as merging the best of finance and technology. In recognition of those disruptive innovators creating positive and diverse change within the financial services space, Benzinga chatted with Nasdaq Inc’s (NASDAQ: NDAQ) Garrick Stavrovich and Devin McCarthy regarding the Nasdaq Fund Network. About: Nasdaq, at its core, is a financial technology company. Apart from supporting firms like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), from their earliest stages, Nasdaq offers numerous other products and services, all of which increase market access and transparency for both institutions and retail participants. One service is the Nasdaq Fund Network, or NFN, which collects and disseminates performance, NAV, valuation, and strategy-level reference data for over 35,000 investible products. “The goal of the Nasdaq Fund Network is to provide transparency and distribution for IRAs, asset managers, and both institutional and retail investors,” said Devin McCarthy, NFN managing director. “We work with the issuers of mutual funds, collective investment trusts, unit investment trusts, and we register those instruments and apply, whether it’s a five- or six-character ticker symbol, and then we publish that market data to over 400,000 different financial platforms.” In the simplest way, NFN enables users to register their products and receive a unique symbol. Thereafter, Nasdaq disseminates product data and makes it searchable to nearly 100 million-plus investors, through online brokerages and market data providers. Issuers and asset managers, in turn, benefit from the increased awareness, which can help gather assets for new and existing products. “With the use of the NFN identifiers, you can now find insight into ... the many other products that have been around, that the Main Street investor doesn’t really have insight or transparency into, and many of them have better returns than the market, in certain cases,” said Garrick Stavrovich, head of product development, Nasdaq Cloud Data Service. Use Case, Recent Developments: Take Collective Investment Trusts (CITs), a type of tax-exempt, pooled investment vehicle, for example. “CITs are very similar to mutual funds,” McCarthy explained. “They strike a daily NAV, but they’re only for qualified, institutional investors.” For the last 80 to 90 years, according to McCarthy, CITs were relatively non-transparent and seldom published by major vendors and platforms. As asset management fees have declined, financial advisors, in the retirement planning space, are looking at lower-cost vehicles, like CITs, to recommend to plan sponsors. “One of the things that we’ve done recently is being able to provide more transparency into this really opaque asset class,” the managing director noted. “CITs are advantageous to recommend because the fees are much lower than mutual funds, and that’s a trend we’ve been responding to, ... allowing financial advisors and, ultimately, retirement plan participants to have access to this information.” Adding, Nasdaq is currently hard at work, bringing standardization and transparency to the area of Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs), a space that has grown over the last few years. “We’re working on the ability to register retail SMAs and models, to be able to give financial advisors and retail participants, that are invested in these instruments, more clarity into how their investments are doing.” Innovation Outlook: In light of the data explosion, market participants are looking for better ways to derive actionable insights. As a result, Nasdaq, in line with its commitment to fuel the new wave of on-demand finance and democratize information, is working on adding data to the NFN and augmenting it. “That includes holding data, information regarding related fund strategies that we have on our platform, and being able to provide that out as part of the overall service we provide to the asset management community,” Stavrovich said. “People come to us for the insights of the NAV, dividend, and yield. It’s about ... [providing] a one-stop-shop.” See more from BenzingaClick here for options trades from BenzingaFinary Raises .2M For Platform That Enables Finance Creators To Monetize Content© 2021 Benzinga.com.

NEW YORK, April 21, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nasdaq, Inc. (Nasdaq: NDAQ) today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2021. First quarter 2021 net revenues were $851 million, an increase of $150 million, or 21%, from $701 million in the prior year period. Net revenues reflected a $118 million, or 17%, positive impact from organic growth, an $18 million increase from the impact of favorable changes in FX rates and a $14 million increase from the inclusion of revenues from acquisitions. “I am pleased with how our team delivered for clients against an incredibly dynamic capital markets backdrop, reflecting record trading and listing results as well as strong growth across our solutions segments,"" said Adena Friedman, President and CEO, Nasdaq. ""We continue to execute against key secular growth opportunities, as illustrated by strong momentum in our institutional investor analytics solutions, as well as by the broad-based growth in total company ARR compared to the prior year period. We are also making fundamental progress in Nasdaq's strategic repositioning this year, with the close of the Verafin acquisition, and the consequent expansion of our addressable market and long-term performance potential.” GAAP operating expenses were $486 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $60 million from $426 million in the first quarter of 2020. The increase of $60 million primarily relates to an $18 million increase from acquisitions and a $15 million increase from changes in FX rates. In addition, the increase reflects higher compensation and benefits expense, higher merger and strategic initiatives expense, and higher depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by lower general, administrative and other expense. The lower general, administrative and other expense primarily reflects bond refinancing costs that were incurred in the first quarter of 2020, higher charitable donations made to COVID-19 response and relief efforts in the first quarter of 2020 and reduced corporate travel expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $393 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $57 million, or 17%, compared to the first quarter of 2020. This increase reflects a $24 million, or 7%, organic increase over the prior year period, an $18 million increase from acquisitions and a $15 million increase from changes in FX rates. The organic increase was primarily driven by higher performance-linked compensation expenses. ""I am incredibly excited to become Nasdaq's CFO at such an interesting time, in particular to have the opportunity to support our evolution as a technology and analytics provider,"" said Ann Dennison, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Nasdaq. ""During the first quarter, we completed the Verafin acquisition, which we financed at attractive interest rates. In addition, we reached an agreement to divest our U.S. Fixed Income business and announced an increase to our existing share repurchase program authorization to, over time, neutralize the impact of the divestiture on our EPS."" On a GAAP basis, net income in the first quarter of 2021 was $298 million, an increase of 47% compared to $203 million in the first quarter of 2020. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.78, an increase of 46% compared $1.22 in the first quarter of 2020. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the first quarter of 2021 was $327 million, an increase of 30% compared to $251 million in the first quarter of 2020. Non-GAAP diluted EPS totaled $1.96, an increase of 31% from $1.50 in the first quarter of 2020. As of March 31, 2021, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $774 million and total debt of $5,890 million, resulting in net debt of $5,116 million. This compares to total debt of $5,541 million and net debt of $2,796 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in net debt reflects closing the acquisition of Verafin. As of March 31, 2021, there was $248 million remaining under the board authorized share repurchase program (excluding the additional $1 billion authorized subject to the closing of the divestiture of our U.S. Fixed Income business and the resulting share issuance upon the consummation of that transaction). UPDATING 2021 NON-GAAP EXPENSE AND TAX GUIDANCE5 The company is updating its 2021 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1,570 to $1,620 million. Nasdaq expects its 2021 non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 27%. BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Market Services - Net revenues were a record $338 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $57 million, or 20%, compared to the first quarter of 2020. Equity Derivative Trading and Clearing - Net revenues increased $12 million, or 13%, in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020. The increase primarily reflects higher U.S. industry trading volumes, partially offset by a lower U.S. net capture rate. Cash Equity Trading - Net revenues increased $35 million, or 36%, in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020. The increase primarily reflects higher U.S. industry trading volumes, net capture rates, and the impact from changes in FX rates, partially offset by lower U.S. market share. Fixed Income and Commodities Trading and Clearing - Net revenues increased $2 million, or 12%, in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to the impact from changes in FX rates. Trade Management Services - Revenues increased $8 million, or 11%, in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to increased demand for connectivity services. Corporate Platforms - Revenues were $155 million in the first quarter of 2021, up $27 million, or 21%, compared to the first quarter of 2020. Listing Services - Revenues increased $23 million, or 31%, in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. listing revenues due to an increase in the overall number of listed companies and higher Nasdaq Private Market revenues. IR & ESG Services - Revenues increased $4 million, or 8%, in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to an increase in both IR and ESG advisory services revenues. Investment Intelligence - Revenues were $258 million in the first quarter of 2021, up $47 million, or 22%, compared to the first quarter of 2020. Market Data - Revenues increased $11 million, or 11%, in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020. The increase reflects organic growth in proprietary data products from new sales, including continued expansion geographically and an increase in shared tape plan revenues. Index - Revenues increased $29 million, or 40%, in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher licensing revenues from higher average assets under management (AUM) in exchange traded products (ETPs) linked to Nasdaq indexes and higher licensing revenues from futures trading linked to the Nasdaq-100 Index. Analytics - Revenues increased $7 million, or 17%, in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to growth in eVestment and Solovis clients. Market Technology - Revenues were $100 million in the first quarter of 2021, up $19 million, or 23% compared to the first quarter of 2020. Marketplace Infrastructure Technology - Revenues increased $2 million, or 4%, in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020, primary due to the impact from changes in FX rates. Anti Financial Crime Technology - Revenues increased $17 million, or 59%, in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020. The increase is due to continued growth in surveillance solutions, the inclusion of revenues from our acquisition of Verafin and the impact from changes in FX rates. CORPORATE HIGHLIGHTS Nasdaq accelerates the company's evolution as a leading SaaS technology provider of anti-financial crime solutions by completing the acquisition of Verafin. In February 2021, Nasdaq completed the acquisition of Verafin, an industry pioneer in anti-financial crime technology solutions. The acquisition strengthens Nasdaq's existing regulatory and anti-financial crime solutions, while expanding Verafin's reach to serve a global ecosystem of Tier-1 and Tier-2 banks and broker-dealers. ETP assets under management tracking Nasdaq indexes and derivative product volume tracking Nasdaq indexes each set new quarterly records. Overall AUM in ETPs benchmarked to Nasdaq's proprietary indexes totaled $385 billion as of March 31, 2021, an increase of 87% compared to March 31, 2020. Additionally, the number of futures and options on futures contracts tracking Nasdaq indexes set a quarterly record with 105 million contracts traded, an increase of 31% from 80 million in the first quarter of 2020. There are 17 products tracking Nasdaq indexes which launched in the first quarter of 2021, including 13 outside of the U.S. Nasdaq's analytics business led by eVestment and Solovis delivered strong retention and sales growth during the first quarter of 2021. The eVestment and Solovis analytics businesses continue to see increased growth, not only due to increased number of users, but also in both new sales and retention compared to the prior year period. On a sequential basis, new sales were up 23% from the fourth quarter of 2020, reflecting both a rebound in institutional investment industry demand following some temporary contraction in 2020, as well as increasing realization of synergies across the suite of solutions. These synergies helped to drive 28 new accounts to Solovis in the first quarter of 2021. The Nasdaq Stock Market led U.S. exchanges for IPOs during the first quarter of 2021. The Nasdaq Stock Market led U.S. exchanges with a 69% total IPO win rate, including a 77% win rate among operating companies6 and a 66% win rate among special purpose acquisition companies. In the first quarter of 2021, The Nasdaq Stock Market welcomed 275 IPOs representing $74 billion in capital raised, including 79 operating company IPOs such as Bumble, Qualtrics, Affirm, Playtika and Petco, as well as 196 IPOs from special purpose acquisition companies. Nasdaq's Market Services segment sets new quarterly trading volume records in U.S. options and U.S. equities in the first quarter of 2021. In the first quarter of 2021, Nasdaq's U.S. options market set a quarterly record of 892 million contracts traded, an increase of 57% year over year. Additionally, Nasdaq led all exchanges during the period in total volume traded for options inclusive of both multiply-listed equity options and index options products. Nasdaq's U.S. equities markets set a quarterly record of 153 billion shares traded, an increase of 20% year over year. Nasdaq agrees to sell its U.S. Fixed Income business to Tradeweb Markets. Nasdaq's decision to sell its U.S. Fixed Income business aligns with its corporate strategy to concentrate its resources and capital to maximize its potential as a major technology and analytics provider to the global capital markets. The transaction is expected to close later in 2021 subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals. ____________1 Represents revenues less transaction-based expenses. 2 Constitutes revenues from Market Technology, Investment Intelligence and Corporate Platforms segments.3 Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) for a given period is the annualized revenue derived from subscription contracts with a defined contract value. This excludes contracts that are not recurring, are one-time in nature or where the contract value fluctuates based on defined metrics. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.4 Refer to our reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP net income, diluted earnings per share, operating income and operating expenses, included in the attached schedules.5 U.S. GAAP operating expense and tax rate guidance are not provided due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain amounts due to a variety of factors including the unpredictability in the movement in foreign currency rates, as well as future charges or reversals outside of the normal course of business. 6 Operating companies exclude special purpose acquisition companies and when a special purpose acquisition company completes an acquisition.

NON-GAAP INFORMATION In addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Nasdaq also discloses certain non-GAAP results of operations, including, but not limited to, non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP operating expenses, that include certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are described in the reconciliation table of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP information provided at the end of this release. Management uses this non-GAAP information internally, along with U.S. GAAP information, in evaluating our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. We believe our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of results as the items described below in the reconciliation tables do not reflect ongoing operating performance. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for our operating results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We recommend investors review the U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release. When viewed in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than U.S. GAAP measures alone. We understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating expenses to assess operating performance. We use these measures because they highlight trends more clearly in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on U.S. GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our ongoing operating performance. Foreign exchange impact: In countries with currencies other than the U.S. dollar, revenues and expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates. Certain discussions in this release isolate the impact of year-over-year foreign currency fluctuations to better measure the comparability of operating results between periods. Operating results excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations are calculated by translating the current period’s results by the prior period’s exchange rates.
