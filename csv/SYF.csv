This short run of losses fits with the general pattern of trading in the past six months: strong gains, a brief pullback that does not completely erase them, followed by another round of gains. Rinse and repeat.



It’s a market environment made for a long-term investors. Brief turn-downs are nothing to fear, but they do put added risk on day trading. But the long-term trends right now appear to be working for investors willing to ‘buy and forget.’ The juxtaposition of periodic losses on an upward trend makes finding the ‘perfect’ stock more important than ever.



Which makes the TipRanks Smart Score a perfect tool. The Smart Score evaluates a series of factors for every stock – eight factors in all – and then distills them into a single-digit rating on a scale of 1 to 10. It lets investors see at a glance where a stock is likely to head, before diving into the details.



With this in mind, we’ve used the TipRanks database to pull up three stocks with a ‘Perfect 10’ from the Smart Score. Unsurprisingly, these are also Strong Buys with considerable upside potential for the coming year. Let’s take a closer look.



Eastman Chemical (EMN)



Tennessee-based Eastman got its start in 1920, and was once a subsidiary of Kodak. Today, the company focuses on materials production, employs over 14,000 people worldwide, conducts business in 100 countries, and brought in $8.5 billion in revenue last year. Eastman boasts an extensive product list, including solvents, resins, acids, glycols and polymers among many others.



Eastman’s products are essential in most of their customer industries – a fact which helped the company  to weather the corona crisis. After a mile revenue dip in Q2 of last year, the company’s top line has post three quarters in a row of sequential gains. Revenue in Q4 came in at $2.4 billion, some 3% above consensus and up 7.5% year-over-year. EPS, at $1.99, was up more than 5% yoy. Shares in Eastman are up 42% in the past 12 months, outpacing the 31% gain on the S&P over the same period.



Maintaining its commitment to shareholders, Eastman in May declared a 69-cent common stock dividend. The payment is the third at this level; the company has a recent history of raising the payment between Q3 and Q4 – and has a longer history, going back 12 years, of keeping the dividend reliable. The annualized rate of $2.76 per common share gives a yield of 2.5%, slightly higher than the average found among the S&P 500’s listed companies.



Eastman is sound company, with a diverse product line, and strong market share and branding; of this led Wolfe Research analyst Josh Silverstein to rate the stock as Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $154 price target implying an upside of ~42% in the next 12 months. (To watch Silverstein’s track record, click here)



Backing his stance, Silverstein writes, “[We] believe the outlook for EMN coming out of the downturn continues to have upside... Driving our view is broad end market exposure with more room for recovery with less cyclicality than peers and opportunity for continued pricing upside that can push sequential EBITDA growth to beat prior peak levels.”



It’s clear from the consensus rating, a Strong Buy based on 10 Buys and 3 Holds, that Wall Street generally agrees with the bullish views on this one. The shares are priced at $108.19 and their $138.31 average price target suggests an upside of 28%. (See EMN stock analysis on TipRanks)







Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC)



The right stock can be a figurative gold mine – but when that stock is in a mining company, it might just be a literal gold mine, too! Kinross is a $7.7 billion gold mining company, based in Toronto, Canada and operating in the US, Russia, West Africa, and Brazil. The company has approximately 30 million ounces in proven and probably gold reserves, and this year saw first quarter gold production of 558,777 ounces.



Kinross shows a clear pattern in its quarterly earnings results, with the lowest top line in Q1 and rising revenues through Q4. The most recent report, for 1Q21, fits this patter perfectly. The $989 million reported was down from Q4’s $1.23 billion – but it was up a noticeable 5.5% year-over-year. The gains come in part from an increase in realized gold price, which was up 13% yoy to $1,787 per ounce.



In the first quarter, Kinross dodged two bullets that could have seriously impeded operations. First, the Round Mountain open pit mine in Nevada showed instability of the northern wall. It was a dangerous situation that delayed some planned mining operations, but has been resolved. And second, in June a fire stopped production at the Tasiast mine and mill in Mauritania. The company has worked with local officials to control the situation and put a timeline on renewed production.



Sometimes, Wall Street’s analysts take an eye-catching action on a stock – and that’s the case here. Credit Suisse analyst Fahad Tariq saw fit to upgrade KGC shares from Neutral to Outperform (i.e., a Buy), writing of the stock, “While we appreciate that YTD the company has faced two major operational hurdles – the Round Mountain pit wall instability and Tasiast fire – we think the impact is mainly limited to 2021, with 2022/23 still looking like strong production years. There could also be upside from a potentially earlier restart of the Tasiast mill vs. the current (somewhat conservative) year-end timeline. In 2022, we expect the company to offset Round Mountain’s lost Phase W ounces with other ore sources, and expect higher grade ounces to be pulled forward at Tasiast…. We also see the stock being supported by buybacks, which could be accelerated in the near-term.”



Tariq gives Kinross shares an $8 price target, implying an upside of ~31% this year. (To watch Tariq’s track record, click here)



With 10 recent reviews on file, including 8 to Buy and just 2 to Hold, Kinross gets a Strong Buy consensus rating from Wall Street’s analysts. The average price target of $9.50 suggest an upside of 55% for the stock, somewhat more bullish than Tariq’s above. The current trading price here is $6.09. (See KGC stock analysis on TipRanks)







Synchrony Financial (SYF)



We’ll wrap up in the financial sector, where Synchrony, the parent company of Synchrony Bank, provides credit, savings, and other consumer banking services. The company is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, is FDIC insured, and operated wholly online. Like many online companies, able to provide customer services despite the COVID lockdowns, Synchrony saw strong share gains over the past year, gaining 103% in share price in the last 12 months.



Earlier this month, Synchrony announced that it had renewed the consumer financing program it runs in partnership with TJX Companies (TJX), the parent company of the TJ Maxx department stores. The renewal makes Synchrony the exclusive provider of TJX’s rewards programs. In a related – but potentially much bigger move – Synchrony also partners with Amazon (AMZN) on the Amazon.com Store Card and Prime Store Cards.



Also this month, Synchrony released its 2Q21 financial numbers, showing net earnings of $1.2 billion. This comes out to $2.12 per share, up by 22% from the previous quarter – and light-years ahead of the 6-cent EPS reported in the year-ago quarter. In a key metric, the company reported a 58% yoy gain in new accounts, to 6.3 million.



Evercore ISI analyst John Pancari initiates coverage of Synchrony by noting the companies' strong ties to Amazon, writing, “We acknowledge that despite the scale of the business, the financial contribution of the Amazon deal is likely to be limited by particularly thin pricing - evident in JP Morgan’s apparent willingness to part ways and considering Amazon’s pricing power. Accordingly, we believe the underlying profitability of the Amazon relationship to Synchrony will be heavily predicated on sheer transaction volume, as well as other potential product tie-ins…”



Pancari is bullish, however, rating SYF as Outperform (i.e. Buy), and setting a $56 price target indicating confidence in a ~22% one-year upside. (To watch Pancari’s track record, click here)



This financial services company has picked up no fewer than 16 ratings from the Wall Street analyst corps, including 13 to Buy and 3 to Hold. This gives the stock a Strong Buy consensus view, while the average price target of $55.80 suggests an upside of 24% from the trading price of $44.80. (See SYF stock analysis on TipRanks)

It added shares in insurance broker Aon Plc, which is seeking to close a deal with rival Willis Towers Watson Plc.Buffett’s company has spent the last year revamping its holdings in financial firms, sticking by a massive stake in Bank of America Corp. valued at $39.1 billion, while exiting investments in JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. A more than three-decade investment in Wells Fargo, which once ranked as the company’s largest common stock bet, has been slowly disappearing in recent years and totaled just $26.4 million at the end of the first quarter.Meanwhile, Berkshire has dug even deeper into the insurance-brokerage industry. The bet on Aon, disclosed in a quarterly filing, comes just months after Berkshire revealed a stake in its rival Marsh McLennan. Aon and Willis Towers Watson have agreed to sell some assets to help ease regulatory concerns around their proposed combination. The Aon holding was valued at about $943 million at the end of the first quarter.In February, Berkshire disclosed three bets, including the Marsh McLennan stake, that it had been building up in secret. The company then spent the first quarter taking those bets in different directions, ramping up its stake in Marsh McLennan and Verizon Communications Inc. while cutting a Chevron Corp. holding roughly in half.Buffett and two of his key deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, oversee investments for the conglomerate’s $282 billion stock portfolio. The firm ended up increasing two other bets -- a stake in Kroger Co. and a holding in furniture company RH -- during the first quarter.(Updates with stake sizes, Verizon, Chevron, Kroger and RH starting in second paragraph.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b2f30e94c136ac4b7b4607979f56c3bc4150d31d822f2925663e77d9523fab8e

Synchrony said in a regulatory filing that it expects to recognize a gain on the sale of the portfolio when it unloads it next April.“Synchrony was unable to reach contractual and economic terms with Gap that made sense for our company and our shareholders,” the Stamford, Connecticut-based firm said in the filing.Synchrony shares dropped 3.7% to $41.55 at 2:34 p.m. in New York, the second-worst performance in the 65-company S&P 500 Financials Index. The lender plans to use about $1 billion of the proceeds from the sale of the portfolio to buy back shares and invest in “higher growth programs,” according to the filing.Gap and Synchrony have offered cards together for more than two decades, and the lender counts the retailer as one of its five largest partners. The portfolio represents about 5% of the bank’s roughly $80 billion in receivables.It’s the second time Synchrony has opted not to renew a partnership with a major retailer after Walmart Inc. shifted its portfolio to Capital One Financial Corp., a move that was first announced in 2018. The decision comes just a few weeks after the lender installed Brian Doubles as its new chief executive officer, replacing its longtime leader, Margaret Keane.“This is a speed bump,” Jon Arfstrom, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients. “We do not believe this loss (and Walmart in 2018) are due to any uncompetitive positioning for Synchrony, and we believe it comes down to preferences and negotiations and bottom-line profitability.”Gap, like most of its mall-based peers, has struggled to attract customers during the coronavirus pandemic. “We faced one of the most difficult years in our company’s history,” Chief Executive Officer Sonia Syngal said last month as Gap capped its fiscal year with fourth-quarter sales that fell short of Wall Street’s expectations.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:“Revenue and earnings from the Gap partnership have been steadily shrinking, so the retailer’s move to Barclays should reduce Synchrony’s costs and shift resources to new, high-potential cards with Venmo and Verizon.”-- David Ritter, BI fintech analystClick here to read the research.Its Banana Republic brand, which primarily sells work clothes, has been particularly weak. One bright spot for the retailer is its Athleta activewear brand, which passed $1 billion in sales in 2020.Gap said the new credit-card program will be a key component of the revamped rewards program it launched in September. Barclays will issue both private label and co-brand credit cards for Gap, with the latter using Mastercard Inc.’s payment network.“With our shared values and focus on inclusion, we look forward to working with Gap Inc. and Barclays to deliver an enhanced card program to their customers,” Linda Kirkpatrick, president of Mastercard’s North America business, said in an emailed statement.It will be Barclays’s first private-label card, and the bank has already begun investing in the systems it will need to provide the program, said Denny Nealon, CEO of the U.S. consumer bank at Barclays. The bank has also recently been investing in data and analytics and other efforts to improve technology.Barclays has been looking to diversify its card partnerships, which have long focused on airlines, cruises and hotel chains. The firm recently debuted a new card with the nonprofit AARP.“We’re absolutely thrilled to join forces with Gap, it’s an iconic American brand, its got a huge customer base,” Nealon said. “We think we can help them drive growth and success.”(Updates with executive commentary beginning in 11th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3734f823ffc7aa4b1d2c99af2b2f9800c6874b4e25cadbe91e5b19086289873e

Today only 23% of the firm’s credit card holders have subprime credit.The number of locations where the company offers credit products grew from 338,000 in 2014 to 440,000 today. Purchase volume also increased from approximately $103 billion to $139 billion, and the number of active accounts expanded from 64.3 million to 68.5 million.This growth occurred despite the pandemic and the 2018 loss of the Walmart (WMT) credit card program, which accounted for 13% of Synchrony’s receivables.Prior to the pandemic, Synchrony recorded impressive annual increases in revenue and EPS.Strengths And WeaknessesSynchrony relies on a handful of retail card partners. Gap (GPS), JCPenny, Lowe’s (LOW), PayPal (PYPL) and Sam’s Club accounted for 51% of the company’s total interest and fees on loans and 47% of loans receivables in 2020.The firm’s retail card agreements generally last five to ten years.  Eleven of the current 25 agreements expire before 2025. However, the 14 partnerships that expire in 2025 or later comprise nearly 90% of the company's annual interest and fees on loans.Another concern is the firm's delinquency rate.  The latest results pegged the 30-plus day delinquency rate at 3.07% versus 4.44% last year. The 90-plus day delinquency rate is at 1.40% compared to 2.15% last year.However, Synchrony had a pandemic-related forbearance program in effect until December.  Additionally, the bank’s credit card delinquency rate, at 3.2% in January, exceeds the average major bank’s delinquency rate of 2.12%. Management forecasts a peak in delinquencies in Q3 2021, and the bank has set aside a massive amount of funds for loss provisions.Where Synchrony shines is in the company’s net interest margin (a key measure of a bank’s profitability). Despite a coronavirus related hit, it's NIM is still near 15%.  In contrast, the average US bank earned a NIM of 2.8% in 2020.The company is also shareholder friendly. Aside from the well-funded dividend, Synchrony has a $1.6 billion share repurchase program representing 7% of its market cap coming into effect in 2021.Prior share repurchase programs have retired a significant percentage of the company’s stock.What Does Wall Street Think?Consensus among Wall Street analysts for SYF is a Strong Buy based on 10 Buy ratings and 1 Hold rating. The average analyst price target of $44.80 implies upside potential of around 15% from current levels over the next 12 months. (See Synchrony stock analysis on TipRanks)Bottom LineThe real positives for the company are an industry leading NIM and Synchrony’s history of strong growth.  The primary concerns are the company's exposure to retail and its client concentration. However, there is one more weight to be added to the scale.Over the last year, US bank deposits increased by nearly $3 trillion, the equivalent of four years of average savings growth.  Meanwhile, credit card debt dropped by 14%, reaching a four-year low.Although 2021 will likely bring increased credit card delinquency rates, the surge in savings and positive trends in consumer debt should mute these to a certain extent.  Despite COVID-19 headwinds, Synchrony generated nearly $1.4 billion in net income, management instituted a robust share repurchase program, and the dividend is well covered.Furthermore, Synchrony has a forward PE ratio of 7.90 and a forward PEG ratio of 0.35. These metrics imply that Synchrony’s current valuation could provide a reasonable margin of safety and might be an investment worthy of consideration.Disclosure: On the date of publication, Charles Walston did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.
