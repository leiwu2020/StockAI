The start of fabrication signifies the first 100 tons of steel have been cut. “Our workforce has invested more than a decade of effort, creativity and resolve to make the Legend-class national security cutter production line incredibly efficient and strong,” Ingalls Shipbuilding President Kari Wilkinson said. “We are pleased to achieve this milestone and will continue to look for any additional opportunity in our processes and approaches to provide the most affordable and capable ships to our customers.” NSC 11 is named to honor Elizebeth Smith Friedman.

During World War II, she worked against German espionage communications and developed information that was critical to counterintelligence work in the Southern Hemisphere. Friedman’s work resulted in hundreds of criminal prosecutions, saved thousands of lives and laid the groundwork for the science of cryptology and the establishment of the modern day National Security Agency.

The Legend-class NSC is the most technologically advanced ship in the Coast Guard’s fleet, which enables it to meet the high demands required for maritime and homeland security, law enforcement, marine safety, environmental protection and national defense missions. NSCs are 418 feet long with a top speed of 28 knots, a range of 12,000 miles, an endurance of 60 days and a crew of 120.

Operating income in the quarter was $147 million and operating margin was 6.5%, compared to $215 million and 9.5%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2020. The decreases in operating income and operating margin were primarily the result of a less favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustment, partially offset by stronger segment operating results compared to the prior year. Segment operating income1 in the quarter was $191 million and segment operating margin1 was 8.4%, compared to $156 million and 6.9%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2020. The increases in segment operating income1 and segment operating margin1 were primarily the result of higher risk retirement at Ingalls Shipbuilding and improved performance at Technical Solutions. Net earnings in the quarter were $148 million, compared to $172 million in the first quarter of 2020. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter was $3.68, compared to $4.23 in the same period of 2020. Excluding the impacts of pension, adjusted earnings per share1 in the quarter was $3.56, compared to $2.43 in the same period of 2020. First quarter cash from operations was $43 million and free cash flow1 was negative $16 million, compared to $68 million and $2 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2020. New contract awards in the quarter were approximately $5.3 billion, bringing total backlog to approximately $48.8 billion as of March 31, 2021. “We are pleased with first quarter results that demonstrate another quarter of consistent program execution,” said Mike Petters, HII’s president and CEO.

See Exhibit B for definitions and reconciliations. Ingalls Shipbuilding revenues for the first quarter of 2021 were $649 million, an increase of $20 million, or 3.2%, from the same period in 2020, primarily driven by higher revenues in the Arleigh Burke-class DDG program, partially offset by lower revenues in the Legend-class National Security Cutter (NSC) program. DDG program revenues increased due to higher volumes on George M. Neal (DDG 131), Jeremiah Denton (DDG 129) and Jack H. Lucas (DDG 125), partially offset by lower volumes on USS Fitzgerald (DDG 62) restoration and modernization following its redelivery and Delbert D. Black (DDG 119) following its delivery. Revenues on the NSC program decreased due to lower volume on Stone (NSC 9) following its delivery. Amphibious assault ship revenues were flat as a result of higher volumes on Pittsburgh (LPD 31), Bougainville (LHA 8) and LHA 9 (unnamed), partially offset by lower volumes on Richard M. McCool Jr. (LPD 29), Fort Lauderdale (LPD 28) and USS Tripoli (LHA 7). Ingalls Shipbuilding segment operating income for the first quarter was $91 million, an increase of $23 million from the same period last year. Segment operating margin in the quarter was 14.0%, compared to 10.8% in the same period last year. The increases were primarily driven by higher risk retirement on Bougainville (LHA 8). Key Ingalls Shipbuilding milestones for the quarter: Began fabrication of guided-missile destroyer Jeremiah Denton (DDG 129)Awarded Life-Cycle Engineering Contract on U.S. Navy’s LPD Program Newport News Shipbuilding Three Months Ended March 31 ($ in millions) 20212020$ Change% ChangeRevenues $1,407 $1,341 $66 4.9% Segment operating income1 93 95 (2) (2.1)% Segment operating margin %1 6.6 %7.1% (47) bps 1 Non-GAAP measures. See Exhibit B for definitions and reconciliations. Newport News Shipbuilding revenues for the first quarter of 2021 were $1.4 billion, an increase of $66 million, or 4.9%, from the same period in 2020, driven primarily by higher revenues in aircraft carriers, naval nuclear support services, and submarines. Aircraft carrier revenues increased primarily as a result of higher volumes on Enterprise (CVN 80), the refueling and complex overhaul (RCOH) of USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74) and Doris Miller (CVN 81), partially offset by lower volumes on the John F. Kennedy (CVN 79) and the RCOH of USS George Washington (CVN 73). Naval nuclear support services revenues increased primarily as a result of higher volumes in carrier and submarine fleet support services, offset by lower volume in facility maintenance services. Submarine revenues increased primarily as a result of higher volumes on the Columbia-class submarine program and the Virginia-class submarine (VCS) program. The higher volume on the VCS program was due to higher volumes on Block V boats, offset by lower volumes on Block IV boats. Newport News Shipbuilding segment operating income for the first quarter was $93 million, compared to operating income of $95 million for the same period last year. Segment operating margin in the quarter was 6.6%, compared to 7.1% in the same period last year. The decreases were primarily due to lower risk retirement on the RCOH of USS George Washington (CVN 73), partially offset by higher risk retirement on Block IV of the VCS program. Key Newport News Shipbuilding milestones for the quarter: Launched Virginia-class submarine Montana (SSN 794)Achieved pressure hull complete on Virginia-class submarine New Jersey (SSN 796)Awarded $3 billion contract for USS John C.

See Exhibit B for definitions and reconciliations. Technical Solutions revenues for the first quarter of 2021 were $259 million, a decrease of $58 million from the same period in 2020, primarily due to the divestitures of our oil and gas business and the San Diego Shipyard, as well as lower volumes in Defense & Federal Solutions, partially offset by the acquisition of Hydroid in March of 2020. Technical Solutions segment operating income for the first quarter was $7 million, compared to a segment operating loss of $7 million in the first quarter of 2020. The increase was primarily driven by improved performance in Defense & Federal Solutions and Nuclear & Environmental Services, as well as a gain on the sale of our oil and gas business. Key Technical Solutions milestones for the quarter: Completed the first phase of Unmanned Systems Center of Excellence campus with the construction of a 22,000 square foot facilityAwarded position on a $250 million U.S. Navy Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Support ContractAwarded a contract to provide maintenance, training and planning support for U.S. Navy aircraft carriers About Huntington Ingalls Industries Huntington Ingalls Industries is America’s largest military shipbuilding company and a provider of professional services to partners in government and industry.

We internally manage our operations by reference to segment operating income and segment operating margin, which are not recognized measures under GAAP. When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use segment operating income and segment operating margin in addition to, and not as alternatives for, operating income and operating margin or any other performance measure presented in accordance with GAAP. They are measures that we use to evaluate our core operating performance. We believe that segment operating income segment operating margin reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We believe these measures are used by investors and are a useful indicator to measure our performance. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of segment operating income and segment operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not measures recognized under GAAP. They should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe these measures are useful to investors because they exclude items that do not reflect our core operating performance. They may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Free cash flow is not a measure recognized under GAAP. Free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We believe free cash flow is an important measure for our investors because it provides them insight into our current and period-to-period performance and our ability to generate cash from continuing operations. We also use free cash flow as a key operating metric in assessing the performance of our business and as a key performance measure in evaluating management performance and determining incentive compensation. Free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Segment operating income (loss) is defined as operating income (loss) for the relevant segment(s) before the Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment and non-current state income taxes. Segment operating margin is defined as segment operating income (loss) as a percentage of sales and service revenues. Adjusted net earnings is defined as net earnings adjusted for the after-tax impact of the FAS/CAS Adjustment. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net earnings divided by the weighted-average diluted common shares outstanding. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures net of related grant proceeds. FAS/CAS Adjustment is defined as the difference between expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits determined in accordance with GAAP (FAS) and the expenses determined in accordance with U.S. Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment is defined as the difference between the service cost component of our pension and other postretirement expense determined in accordance with GAAP (FAS) and our pension and other postretirement expense under U.S. Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). Non-current state income taxes are defined as deferred state income taxes, which reflect the change in deferred state tax assets and liabilities and the tax expense or benefit associated with changes in state uncertain tax positions in the relevant period. These amounts are recorded within operating income. Current period state income tax expense is charged to contract costs and included in cost of sales and service revenues in segment operating income. We present financial measures adjusted for the Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment and non-current state income taxes to reflect the company’s performance based upon the pension costs and state tax expense charged to our contracts under CAS. We use these adjusted measures as internal measures of operating performance and for performance-based compensation decisions.

Starting in 2023, the school will grant associate degrees of applied science in maritime technology to apprentices who complete the required coursework and skills training, including maintenance electrician, marine designer, nuclear test technician, welding and modeling and simulation program analyst. “We’re proud to expand our competitive skills training and leadership program to offer academic degrees to apprentices,” said Latitia McCane, director of education at The Apprentice School. “This historic achievement is a natural progression to the investment in workforce development we have made to recruit, train and develop the next generation of shipbuilders, and provide continued opportunities for personal and professional growth.” The Apprentice School, which has been accredited since 1982, affords apprentices the opportunity to earn academic degrees through its existing partnerships with institutions of higher education.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a small, socially distanced event was held with limited in-person attendance. “The christening of Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee is a significant milestone that brings our 34th destroyer one step closer to being introduced into the fleet,” Ingalls Shipbuilding President Kari Wilkinson said. “In these ever-changing times, the significance of what we do has never been more important. We are exceedingly proud of our shipbuilders for their tenacity and perseverance, and look forward to continuing Ingalls’ legacy of building quality ships with respect and pride.” Recently retired Ingalls Shipbuilding President Brian Cuccias returned to host the christening, which was originally scheduled to occur in 2020 but was postponed due to restrictions surrounding the pandemic. “I am honored to host this christening and give a final salute to the hardworking men and women who build freedom in this shipyard every day,” Cuccias said. “Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee’s distinguished legacy will remain steadfast with the christening of this great ship, as will the unparalleled craftsmanship of the men and women of Ingalls Shipbuilding.” A photo accompanying this release is available at: https://newsroom.huntingtoningalls.com/file/ddg-123-christening-bottle-break. DDG 123 is named to honor Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee, the first woman to receive the Navy Cross. Higbee joined the Navy in October 1908 as part of the newly established Navy Nurse Corps, a group of women who would become known as “The Sacred Twenty,” and became the second superintendent of the Navy Nurse Corps in January 1911. Ray Mabus, the 75th Secretary of the Navy, was the keynote speaker. “This christening is a signal event in the life of a warship deeply engrained in naval tradition when a ship officially bears the name it will carry during its time in the fleet,” Mabus said. “The story and the legacy of Lenah Higbee, and what she represents, will live on for decades around the world through this ship’s voyages and through the lives of the crew who sail aboard her.” DDG 123 sponsors are Louisa Dixon, Virginia Munford and Pickett Wilson, three women who played an important role during Mabus’ term as governor of Mississippi. Munford spoke on behalf of the three sponsors. “As we help dedicate this ship for service, let us all join together in the fervent hope and prayer that Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee’s primary mission will be to preserve the peace for future generations,” Munford said. Rear Adm. Cynthia Kuehner, commander of the Naval Medical Forces Support Command, spoke on behalf of the chief of naval operations. “I know that USS Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee will protect and defend our nation with the same zeal, courage and valiant resolve of the Navy nurse for whom she is named,” Kuehner said. “Superintendent Higbee’s legacy is a heroic account of a fearless pioneer, a leader among men and women, an advocate and an agent for necessary change, a visionary, a teacher, a scholar, a scientist, an author, an innovator, a strategist. A Navy nurse.” Huntington Ingalls Industries is America’s largest military shipbuilding company and a provider of professional services to partners in government and industry.

Due to the COVID-19 environment, and in an effort to keep all employees, staff, graduates and their guests safe, the ceremony was held outdoors at the Hampton Roads Convention Center in Hampton. “A drive-in movie-style graduation is likely not what you expected, but I think it’s pretty safe to say that the past year in many ways isn’t what any of us expected,” said Jennifer Boykin, president of Newport News Shipbuilding. “Graduating from The Apprentice School is not an easy feat and when you couple the long hours balancing your work and your studies, along with new obstacles you faced this year, like remote learning and working with your entire family in the same area, it makes this accomplishment even more extraordinary,” Boykin told the graduates. “The lessons you’ve learned during the past year have molded you in a way unlike any other apprenticeship experience. The past 12 months, with all its twists and turns it’s brought, have helped train you for challenges yet to come. It is your ability to adapt and your innovative spirit that will help Newport News Shipbuilding continue to thrive, and it’s that spirit that will help our United States Navy be the absolute best it can be.” The commencement address was delivered by Howard Hoege III, president of The Mariners' Museum and Park, in Newport News, who shared a message on leadership. “You’re graduating from a leadership program that puts your leadership development on par with the development of your technical competency,” Hoege said. “Fully commit to being the best leader you can be. Fully commit to being the best servant leader that you can be, and I promise you your decision to go all in for your people will have an impact beyond what you can predict or imagine today. That’s true for the teams where you serve as leaders and it’s true for the impact you’ll have on every single individual that you have the honor of leading.” Mark Byerly received the Homer L. Ferguson Award, which recognizes the apprentice graduating with the highest honors. A nuclear test technician at the Kenneth A. Kesselring Site inBallston Spa, New York, Byerly completed his associate degree in electrical engineering at Tidewater Community College in December 2020. He continues to work towards a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering technology and a minor in mechanical engineering technology from Old Dominion University. In his pre-recorded remarks to graduates, Byerly discussed his many setbacks, his joining the U.S. Marines and his first job at the shipyard working as an electrician on the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78). “The one thing I’ve found, the one thing I continue to see is that we will all fail at some point — it’s how you get back up and keep fighting that makes the difference,” said Byerly, 32, a husband and father of two children. “Whether you choose to let your failures define your life, or you use them to shape and mold you, to power through them and allow them to build you into maybe not who you wanted to be, or where you saw yourself being, but to where you are meant to be in life. Failure is inherent to life. But what’s not inherent, and what takes real courage, and real strength, is standing back up after you’ve been knocked down and pressing on.” Photos accompanying this release are available at: https://newsroom.huntingtoningalls.com/releases/apprentice-school-class-of-2020. Replay coverage of the ceremony will be available on https://nns.huntingtoningalls.com/graduation.

Following a ribbon-cutting ceremony today, sailors ate the first meal prepared in the galley in the nearly three years since it arrived at Newport News.

We look forward to continuing our work with our Navy partners to redeliver the ship to the fleet.” A photo accompanying this release is available at: https://newsroom.huntingtoningalls.com/file/cvn-73-galley.

The RCOH is more than 85% complete, and the ship is on track to be redelivered to the Navy in 2022.

The two companies are developing Copper-Nickel (CuNi) and Nickel-Copper (NiCu) alloys for direct metal printing. 3D Systems’ (DDD) co-founder Chuck Hull said, “Customer-centric innovation has been a driving force for 3D Systems since its founding. Through our on-going collaboration with Newport News Shipbuilding, we have yet another opportunity to bring to bear our deep materials science and application engineering expertise – allowing our customers to maximize the power of additive manufacturing within their organization.” CuNi and NiCu are ideal for marine uses as these alloys are resistant to corrosion. Current casting methods for these alloys require lead times of up to 12 months. With metal 3D printing these lead times can be shortened to only a fraction of the traditional procurement time. Dave Bolcar, Vice President of engineering and design for Newport News Shipbuilding said, “Over the past few years, our companies have collaborated to support the qualification of metal additive manufacturing technologies in order to build parts for naval warships and conducted research and development of a corrosion performance design guide for direct metal printing of a nickel-based alloy. We’re looking forward to expanding on these efforts.” (See 3D Systems stock analysis on TipRanks) 3D Systems has long-term experience of contributing additive manufacturing know-how to the U.S. Navy. Its solutions are used in aircraft parts and submersible components. On March 2, Needham analyst James Ricchiuti reiterated a Hold rating on the stock without assigning any price target. Ricchiuti said, “Investor sentiment in the 3D printing space has been improving in recent months, reflecting signs of a gradual industry recovery and in the case of 3D Systems more optimism about new management’s efforts to restart growth and drive operating leverage in the model. There is potential for more significant upside in earnings coming mainly from cost-reduction initiatives going forward.” Turning to rest of the Street, 3D Systems has a Hold consensus rating based on 6 Holds and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $26.50 implies about 11.2% downside potential from current levels. The stock has seen a jump of about 332.6% over the past year.
