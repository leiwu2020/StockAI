More than half of the country’s multifamily properties are owned by institutional investors compared with an estimated ownership of 2% to 3% of single-family rentals, a gap that he expects to narrow in time.“As traditional commercial real estate investors that invested in multifamily as their key strategy have moved into single-family rental, we’re seeing the market flooded with institutional capital,” Brien said. He acknowledged that dynamic will make it more competitive for Mynd to find properties, but touted its data-driven technology as better enabling it to make offers across the U.S.Oakland, California-based Mynd, founded in 2016, will be focused on buying exclusively for the real estate arm of Invesco Ltd., and will continue to build out its management platform, which includes more than 7,000 homes owned by retail investors and other institutions, he said. Those homes are in 25 cities including Houston; Austin, Texas; and Orlando, Florida. Mynd plans to expand to cities in the Midwest and Southeast such as Oklahoma City, St. Louis and Jacksonville, Florida.“Covid has been an accelerator for migration to more-affordable cities as households pursue favorable tax situations and jobs,“ said Brien, a former kicker in the National Football League.Invesco is separately leading a $40 million financing round for Mynd, which Brien said will be spent on technology and the acquisitions team. Mynd has been buying as many as 50 homes monthly, a figure he expects to grow to 1,000 by next year. That would outpace the roughly 600 monthly purchases that Waypoint Homes, which he co-founded, was making before it became part of Invitation Homes Inc.“We know single-family rental represents a tremendous opportunity to invest in an emerging asset class that will allow us to provide a high-quality living experience to Americans seeking their next home,” Pete Cassiano, managing director at Invesco Real Estate, said in an emailed statement. Invesco Real Estate’s head of North America Bert Crouch is joining Mynd’s board.Investors including Thomvest, Common Fund, Squarepoint, Assurant, DivcoWest and Jackson Square Ventures also participated in the round, which values Mynd at about $300 million.The single-family rental sector has attracted institutional investors including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and Canada’s PSP Investments. Separately, Centerbridge and Allianz Real Estate said in March they led a $1.25 billion equity commitment to Upward America Venture, a partnership with Lennar Corp. that intends to buy homes.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=684acfb971675fa07f2d2335cbd221542271b31cb0cfb08f7063d6f5974b6a25

Since the beginning of May, about $154 million has been pulled from clean-energy ETFs.Thank the pressure on big-tech stocks. Funds that have higher environmental, social and governance standards have long benefited from substantial stakes in giant growth companies. Now a post-pandemic economic recovery is triggering a rotation to cheaper shares, and the benefits are swiftly becoming drawbacks.“They had such a huge run in 2020, but like many of these momentum and growth funds, they have given back much of their gains in 2021,” said Mohit Bajaj, director of ETFs for WallachBeth Capital. “Now we are seeing a rotation out of those into more value-oriented names.”Further details on President Joe Biden’s $2.25 trillion infrastructure plan haven’t been greeted with the enthusiasm that many analysts had hoped. In addition, several clean-energy funds took a hit late last month after Enphase Energy Inc. -- a popular holding -- reported semiconductor shortages and supply-chain issues.“A return to clean-energy ETF inflows exceeding January’s $5 billion may require a performance rebound,” Adeline Diab, an ESG analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a note Tuesday. “Rising interest rates, widening competition and strained supply-chains have tapped the brakes on flow momentum.”Assets in the category have dropped for the past three months in a row and are now at $18.1 billion. That’s down from their peak of $22.3 billion at the end of January.Other large clean-energy ETFs such as the First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Fund Index (QCLN) and the Invesco Wilderhill Clean Energy ETF (PBW) are also facing outflows amid a slide of more than 18% this year.With their heavy-tech exposures, the pain that clean-energy funds are facing could just be getting started. JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist Marko Kolanovic warned last week that big allocations into growth and ESG strategies may leave money managers vulnerable to inflation. As data continue to point to higher prices of goods and services, he bets investors will be forced to shift from low-volatility plays to value stocks.“As money rotates away from those emerging growth themes and into the more economically sensitive areas of the market, clean tech becomes a source of funds,” said Dan Russo, portfolio manager at Potomac Fund Management.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=daf75b9e27ed3a0bc381a1dc787856c9fe24f864dbb298593f98a7f87348167c

The longest portion, a 40-year security, may yield around 115 basis points over Treasuries, said the person, who asked not to be identified as the details are private.Companies have been taking advantage of wide-open bond markets and spreads at three-year lows to score cheap borrowing, even if they don’t need it. With the economy rebounding from the pandemic, U.S. investment-grade firms are increasingly tempted to spend their cash cushions on acquisitions and dividend hikes, or borrow even more.Read more: Corporate Cash Grab Flashes Warning for Bonds: Lisa AbramowiczAmazon is coming off of a record earnings quarter and it provided a sales forecast for the current period that was stronger than analysts’ estimates. Cash and cash equivalents stood at $34 billion at the end of March, up 24% from a year earlier.“They can grow into this leverage,” Matt Brill, head of North America investment grade at Invesco Ltd., said on Bloomberg TV Monday. “If you’re able to borrow for reasonably cheap, and then you’re able to get the operating leverage to go with it, it results in a lot of earnings.”What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“The size of Amazon.com’s balance sheet may grow meaningfully as its weighted-average-cost of debt capital hovers near zero. With abundant cash and growing free cash flow, borrowing may not be needed. Yet the ability to fund organic growth and potentially initiate a large shareholder-return program at historically low costs suggests additional debt over time.” -- Robert Schiffman, senior credit analyst-- Click here to read the researchAmazon has been a fairly infrequent issuer, but it comes in big on those rare occasions. It last tapped the bond market in June 2020, borrowing $10 billion for general corporate purposes. Prior to that, it sold $16 billion of bonds in 2017 to help finance its acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc.The proceeds of Monday’s offering will be for general corporate purposes, which may also include acquisitions and working capital. The two-year bond will be allocated for eligible green or social projects, which may include clean transportation, renewable energy and sustainable buildings, according to bond documents.Amazon has been on a spending spree since the pandemic began, building new warehouses and cloud-computing data centers across the world to meet surging demand from online shoppers and businesses turning to remote work. Purchases of property and equipment totaled $45 billion in the 12 months ended in March, up from $20 billion during the prior period.Amazon’s board of directors authorized $5 billion in share buybacks in 2016, but the company has never made purchases under that authority.Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co. are managing the sale.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=eb086bb21f1dd079e88300013a4a305cd8ffe2056d69136c07598158c3ac0151

Now one ETF issuer is getting ready to offer funds designed to amplify every move.Direxion Investments plans to start an exchange-traded fund intended to double the daily performance of the S&P Global Clean Energy Index. The firm also is working on one that seeks to multiply the return of being short the index by two, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.The Direxion Daily Global Clean Energy Bull 2X Shares and Direxion Daily Global Clean Energy Bear 2X Shares would be the first leveraged clean-energy ETFs in the $6.2 trillion ETF industry. That will be a coming-of-age moment for the clean-energy sector, which has exploded in popularity, with assets surging to more than $18 billion from $4.3 billion a year ago -- even after a recent pullback. Leveraged ETFs use derivatives to amplify the return of the underlying assets.“Some of these clean-energy ETFs are down 30% from their highs and flows are still positive, so demand for clean energy and thematic is still really strong in the face of that,” said Athanasios Psarofagis, ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. “If you look at flows, most that came in clean energy were pretty late so most will be underwater and might be looking for a leveraged play on the way up to make up for that.”Popular funds in the clean-energy category such as the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) and Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) have notched a stellar run, rallying 140% and 234% respectively in 2020. That gave way to a drop in the first months of 2021, with the funds each falling more than 21% year-to-date.Still, inflows have largely held up, with the sector taking in $610 million in April. ICLN alone attracted $434 million last month and hasn’t recorded a month of outflows since November 2019.Overseers of the S&P Global Clean Energy Index also recently increased the target number of stocks in the gauge to 100 from 30. The idea was to reduce concentration risk and improve liquidity, which have become points of concern among investors as cash floods into clean-energy assets.Direxion, which currently has about $23 billion in ETF assets, plans to charge a 0.75% expense ratio for each of the new products. Direxion declined a request for comment due to an SEC quiet period.“Since we’ve had that change of presidency from Trump to Biden, there has been almost a 180-degree change in the way clean investment is viewed,” said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index. “It’s increasing in demand and especially attention which then naturally you follow with some retail demand. I do think it’s an area we will see come into the spotlight more and more as we go into 2021.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=236997e25d8bd14f08e4bc6eab14a2071170d1c536cf322b8e6b8d08994ed6d2

Weakening sentiment has also seen foreign funds turn net sellers of local shares after a six-month buying spree.While there’s no denying that the outbreak and its financial and humanitarian implications remain the key focus for market watchers, some long-term investors from Fidelity International and Invesco are already seeking opportunities to add stocks. Progress in India’s vaccination campaign and relatively less-disruptive lockdown measures are seen offering some support to Asia’s third-largest economy and its equity market.“We think that the resurgence of Covid-19 is short-term concern. We do not expect large-scale lockdowns as policymakers take a more localized approach to controlling the resurgence,” said Sukumar Rajah, director of portfolio management at Franklin Templeton Emerging Markets Equity. “We continue to be positive in the Indian equity markets and continue to identify bottom-up opportunities based on our criteria of quality, sustainability and growth,”A few other money managers are echoing similar views as the market’s recent pullback has brought valuations down from the record highs seen earlier in the year. The Sensex is down about 8% from an all-time high in February -- a 10% slide would mark a technical correction.“A couple of months ago, we did have a view that market is pricing in too many positives, since then we have seen earnings upgrades and valuation has corrected,” said Jitendra Gohil, head of India equity research at Credit Suisse Wealth Management. “We are positive on the market and are recommending investors to buy on this weakness. Our house view is that the recovery will be very sharp in the second half.”This new wave of virus cases may delay India’s recovery, but it is unlikely to derail it, according to Fitch Ratings, which affirmed India’s sovereign debt rating at BBB-, the lowest investment grade score.The Sensex is little changed so far in 2021 after having climbed in each of the previous five years. The gauge has surged 85% from its low in March 2020 -- when global equity markets took the biggest hit from the pandemic -- beating a 71% jump in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index of regional equities.“We will be selective and cautious in the short term, but any correction in the market will provide a buying opportunity,” said Amit Goel, a portfolio manager at Fidelity International.” “We continue to be optimistic on the economy and equities over the medium to long term, driven by structural drivers of growth such as strong demographics, under-penetration of consumer goods and services, increasing urbanisation, and growth in the educated workforce.”Taking ProfitSome are more cautious than others as India reported 314,835 new infections on Thursday, the world’s biggest one-day jump in coronavirus cases ever. The country’s health system has been pushed to breaking point, with hospitals reporting shortages of everything from intensive care beds to medical oxygen.Bodies piling up at crematoriums and burial grounds across the nation are sparking concerns that the death toll from a ferocious new Covid-19 wave may be much higher than official records.Concerns about the virus are also showing in India’s currency and debt markets. The rupee is Asia’s worst-performing currency in April and its slide is worsening a slump in Indian corporate dollar bonds that are now among the region’s worst performers.Aberdeen Standard Investments says that while the surge in infections could trigger stricter lockdowns if the situation worsens, which will have a knock-on impact on the re-opening of the economy and recovery prospects.“We have been nimble in terms of taking some profit off the table or topping up our positions where we see opportunity to do so,” said Kristy Fong, senior investment director for Asian equities at Aberdeen Standard.She also added however that in the longer term, several trends favor India: the presence of many of Asia’s most successful companies that have been tried and tested by prior crises and a growing middle class that is increasingly affluent.For many funds, their optimism is also stemming from expectations of a strong recovery in corporate earnings. Analysts have boosted their 12-month forward profit estimates for Sensex members by around 14% so far this year, about double the rise seen for MSCI Asia Pacific constituents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“We continue to see good earnings growth potential from both near and longer-term perspectives that will be supportive of a strong Indian equity market,” said Rajah of Franklin Templeton.READ: BofA Expects Near-Term Nifty Correction, Gains By Year EndShekhar Shekhar Sambhshivan, an investment director at Invesco, takes comfort from the fact that factories have been running at “decent” capacity during the current wave of infections.His team, meanwhile, has turned to defensive stocks to wade through near-term volatility. It reduced exposure to consumer discretionary stocks in the past month as it sees family spending getting affected, but raised holdings of pharmaceutical and information technology shares.(Updates prices throughout.

Invesco (IVZ) recorded total net inflows of $6.4 billion, with foreign exchange movements decreasing AUM by $4.3 billion. Shares of the Hamilton-based investment manager increased 1.5% to close at $26.71 on April 12. The company’s equity AUM inched up 2.6% from the prior month to $725 billion. Fixed income AUM grew marginally to $301.6 billion, while alternatives AUM declined 1.7% to $176.6 billion. Meanwhile, money market AUM dropped 1.5% to $115.7 billion. (See Invesco stock analysis on TipRanks) On April 9, Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Bedell lifted the stock’s price target to $31 (165 upside potential) from $28 and maintained a Buy rating. According to Bedell, the risk/return dynamics are “heavily favoring” the trust banks, which are sensitive to interest rates and are about to report 1Q results. The rest of the Street is sidelined on the stock with a Hold consensus rating, based on 2 Buys, 5 Holds, and 3 Sells. The average analyst price target of $23.80 implies 10.9% downside potential to current levels. Shares have appreciated 57.6% so far this year. TipRanks’ Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool shows that confidence in Invesco is currently Neutral, as 7 hedge funds decreased their cumulative holdings of the stock by 769,200 shares in the last quarter.
