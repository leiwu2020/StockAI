company,1614179577,Ex-Dividend Date Insight: Fortune Brands Home,66589953,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,FBHS,Yahoo,"On December 8, 2020, Fortune Brands Home (NYSE:FBHS) announced shareholders can expect to receive a dividend payable on March 17, 2021. The stock will then go ex-dividend 1 business day(s) before the record date. The ex-dividend date for Fortune Brands Home is set for February 25, 2021. The company's current dividend payout sits at $0.26, equating to a dividend yield of 1.25% at current price levels. The Significance Of An Ex-Dividend Date An ex-dividend date signals when a company's shares cease to trade with its current dividend payout. There is a small intermission period before the company announces a new dividend. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Typically, companies will announce and implement new dividend yields on a quarterly basis. Understanding Fortune Brands Home's Dividend Performance Over the past year, Fortune Brands Home has experienced an overall upward trend regarding its dividend payouts and a downward trend regarding its yields. Last year on February 27, 2020 the company's payout was $0.24, which has since grown by $0.02. Fortune Brands Home's dividend yield last year was 1.5%, which has since decreased by 0.25%. Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market. To read more news on Fortune Brands Home click here.
