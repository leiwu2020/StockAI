The weekly unemployment claims report and the Philadelphia Fed business outlook report for June will be released today.



S&P, Dow, and Nasdaq futures were in red at the time of writing, with 0.3%, 0.2%, and 0.4% lower trading, respectively.



Commercial Metals Company (CMC), Jabil Circuit (JBL), and Kroger Company (KR) are expected to report earnings before the market opens, while Dynagas LNG Partners LP (DLNG), Adobe (ADBE), and Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc. (SWBI) are expected to report after the market close.



Midatech Pharma Plc (MTP) was the most actively traded stock in pre-market trading. Recently, the R&D biotechnology company, which is focused on improving the bio-delivery and biodistribution of medicines, disclosed breakthrough in vitro data. The data reflects Q-Sphera’s capability in the formulation of proteins into long-acting injectable products, along with progress across multiple other programs. Per the company, these results offer opportunities for its Q-Sphera technology.



KULR Technology Group Inc (KULR) was the biggest gainer in pre-market trading as the stock jumped 65.2% at the time of writing. Recently, the developer of next-generation lithium-ion battery safety and thermal management technologies revealed that it has been granted special permission by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DoT) to transport the prototype lithium cells and batteries aboard cargo aircrafts.



The special permit authorizes the manufacture, mark, sale, and use of KULR's specially designed packaging for the transportation of prototype lithium cells and batteries. It also permits them to transport prototype lithium cells and batteries contained in or packed with equipment, the company said.



KULR’s President and COO Keith Cochran said, “KULR's packaging was approved by the US DoT based on its ability to contain potential hazards in the unlikely event that a cell or battery would experience a thermal event. KULR's newly issued special permit allows customers to safely ship prototype batteries that are necessary to advance innovation and contribute to the development of alternative green energy sources.”



CureVac (CVAC) was the biggest laggard in pre-market trading, as the stock plunged 45.8% at the time of writing. Recently, the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company disclosed results of its second interim analysis of its international pivotal Phase 2b/3 study in about 40,000 subjects (the HERALD study) of CureVac's first-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidate, CVnCoV. At the interim analysis, CVnCoV reflected only 47% interim vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 disease of any severity, and failed to meet pre-specified statistical success criteria.



CureVac CEO Dr. Franz-Werner Haas said, “While we were hoping for a stronger interim outcome, we recognize that demonstrating high efficacy in this unprecedented broad diversity of variants is challenging. As we are continuing toward the final analysis with a minimum of 80 additional cases, the overall vaccine efficacy may change. In addition, the variant-rich environment underlines the importance of developing next-generation vaccines as new virus variants continue to emerge.”



In earnings news, Lennar Corporation (LEN), the home construction company, reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter (ended May 31) results. Net earnings of $2.95 per share surpassed analysts’ expectations of $2.36 per share. It also compares favorably with the net earnings of $1.65 recorded in the same quarter last year.



Revenues came in at $6.4 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $5.88 billion and surged 22% from the year-ago period.  Notably, the company witnessed new orders of 17,157 homes during the quarter, a 32% increase. New home deliveries of 14,493 homes were up 14% year-over-year.



Lennar’s co-CEO Jon Jaffe commented, “We continue to focus on production costs and cycle times as the homebuilding industry ramps up to meet growing demand. Lennar is uniquely positioned with our size, scale and production oriented Everything’s Included business model to mitigate the well documented industry supply challenges.”



In M&A news, Elanco Animal Health (ELAN) will snap up Kindred Biosciences (KIN), a biopharmaceutical company, for $9.25 per share, which represents an approximate value of $440 million. This price signifies a premium of 52% based on the 30-day average.



Through this acquisition, Elanco’s expansion plans will speed up its lucrative pet health space, especially in the burgeoning billion-dollar dermatology category. The deal is likely to add an incremental $100 million to the previous innovation revenue guidance range of $500 million to $600 million by 2025, while also offering attractive opportunities thereafter. The acquisition is expected to close during the third quarter of 2021, subject to certain regulatory approvals.



Elanco CEO Jeff Simmons said, “This highly complementary combination is focused in one of the most exciting spaces in pet health, and one where we see a strategic imperative to build a differentiated competitive offering.”



Meanwhile, Viavi Solutions (VIAV) proposes to snap up all outstanding subordinate voting shares and multiple voting shares of EXFO Inc for a total value of $430 million. The transaction values the company at $7.50 a share, representing a 103% premium to the June 4 closing price. The price tag also represents a 25% premium to the $6 consideration offered under the “Going Private Transaction.""



If the merger is consummated, the combined company is likely to be a leader in communications, tests, and measurement over the next decade. Furthermore, the combined entity will be able to invest in opportunistic growth areas while achieving greater operating leverage. However, the proposed merger faces opposition from EXFO’s majority shareholder, Germain Lamonde, who insists not considering any alternative change of control transaction.



Extended Stay America (STAY), along with its paired-share REIT, ESH Hospitality, Inc., has closed the deal under which they have been acquired by funds managed by Blackstone Real Estate Partners (Blackstone) and Starwood Capital Group. They were acquired for $20.50 per paired share in a cash deal worth $6 billion. In March, an agreement was signed by STAY to be taken private in a 50/50 joint venture between Blackstone Real Estate Partners and private investment firm Starwood Capital Group.



In other news, one of the biggest car manufacturers and a global leader in battery and fuel cell technology, General Motors Co., (GM) disclosed an increase in its Electric Vehicle (EV) and Autonomous Vehicle (AV) spending by 75% to $35 billion through 2025.



General Motors CEO Mary Barra commented, “GM is targeting annual global EV sales of more than 1 million by 2025, and we are increasing our investment to scale faster because we see momentum building in the United States for electrification, along with customer demand for our product portfolio.”",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a68c47e5aca405251e7c7183cdf5f3c656970e63cfb3a099e662c764f2fd3eba

Notably, investors await data for May related to housing starts and permits, along with export and import prices, which are to be released today.

The company reported quarterly revenues of $11.23 billion, up 8% year-over-year, and surpassed analysts’ expectations of $11.04 billion.

Oracle CTO Larry Ellison commented, “The world’s two most popular databases are the Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle MySQL. Independent analysts have tested and confirmed that Oracle MySQL with HeatWave runs 10 to 100 times faster than Amazon's version of MySQL called Aurora. This technological breakthrough is causing several of Amazon's customers to start moving their Aurora workloads to Oracle MySQL. And industry analysts are telling us they are seeing a 10x increase in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customer inquiries. Both the Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle MySQL with HeatWave technology have captured the technology high-ground in the cloud database business-and that bodes well for the future of the Oracle Cloud.”



In M&A news, General Motors (GM) and Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (Wabtec) (WAB) are likely to enter a partnership deal. Per the terms, the two companies will collaborate to advance and commercialize the automaker’s battery and fuel cell technologies for use in Wabtec locomotives.



General Motors’ Ultium battery technology is expected to offer flexibility, efficiency, power, and reliability for use in the rail system, while the compact fuel cell power cubes can be applied in several areas, including locomotives.



General Motors’ President Mark Reuss said, “Rail networks are critical to transportation and to GM’s ability to serve our customers across North America, and Wabtec's bold plan to de-carbonize heavy haul and other locomotive applications helps advance our vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. Wabtec's decision to deploy GM's Ultium battery and HYDROTEC hydrogen fuel cell systems further validates our advanced technology and demonstrates its versatility.”

Housing starts were up 37% year over year. But the reality is, there’s still room to grow. Housing starts are still comfortably below historic highs, which is a good thing. Because if you look at a chart of housing starts, when the highs hit, the market collapses. That is risk in the housing business. There’s always a tendency to overbuild as the market corrects and then underbuild at the bottom, so there’s a history of boom and bust, or cyclicality, in the sector.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 7 Reopening Stocks Being Ignored By Wall Street Right Now Much of that has to do with lending and interest rates. And the Federal Reserve just committed to continued near-zero rates and is pumping lots of money into the system. These seven homebuilding stocks ready for another round are a great way to play this rally. Lennar (NYSE:LEN) LGI Homes (NASDAQ:LGIH) MDC Holdings (NYSE:MDC) PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) Meritage Homes (NYSE:MTH) Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL) Tri Pointe Group (NYSE:TPH) Homebuilding Stocks to Buy: Lennar (LEN) Source: Shutterstock In the business since 1954, LEN is now the largest home construction company in the U.S. If you’re looking for homebuilder stocks to buy, going with the market leader is always a good strategy. Broadly diversified across nearly two dozen states, it can choose where to build to get the most out of the market. LEN also builds multi-family homes (townhouses and apartment buildings), so it can also pivot to investment properties as well as single family homes to occupy. Being the bellwether, it will also signal when the homebuilding wave has run its course, which is always good to know. LEN stock is up 38.5% year to date, but still trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 10x. The stock has an ‘A’ rating in my Portfolio Grader. LGI Homes (LGIH) Source: Felipe Sanchez / Shutterstock.com The Southwest region has been especially hot (pardon the pun) in the past couple of years as people and corporations have been moving to Texas from high-tax states like California. Silicon Valley has become so expensive and crowded that Austin, Texas has become a big hub for venture capitalists and private equity firms. And with them, small tech firms have followed. That growth is continuing to drive population increases to the extent that the recent U.S. Census has added two more U.S. Representatives to Texas due to population growth. 8 Stocks That Could Crash if Infrastructure Spending Falls Through LGIH is focused on the Southwest, and is based out of Texas. That makes it one of the top stocks in the sector to buy into, even after its nearly 60% run year to date. Homebuilding Stocks to Buy: MDC Holdings (MDC) Source: MIND AND I / Shutterstock.com Launched in 1972, MDC focuses on first-time homebuyers, which is a very good market now and makes the homebuilder one of the hot stocks to buy in this sector. With rents rising, homeownership becomes much more realistic with rates so low. MDC operates out of nine high-growth states and regions around the nation, which is perfect for the demographic it serves. It also has a financing arm which helps get its single family detached homes and developments sold once built. MDC stock is up 33% year to date and still sells at a P/E of 11x. The stock has a ‘B’ rating in my Portfolio Grader. PulteGroup (PHM) Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com Named after Bill Pulte, who began building and selling homes in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan (a suburb of Detroit) at the ripe old age of 18 in 1950, PHM is now one of the top three homebuilders in the U.S., with a market cap of nearly $15 billion. It currently operates in 67 markets in 29 states and D.C., expanding each reach as market demand grows beyond big city suburbs into second and third tier cities. This is the big transformation underway as people leave cities and crowded suburbs for more house for their money in cities that are more livable and more affordable. Much of this shift has been brought about by the pandemic and new work from home set-ups. PHM is big enough to take advantage of this shift quickly. Its ability to grow for nearly seven decades is proof its one of the top stocks to buy in this sector and can endure feast and famine. PHM stock is up 40% year to date, with a P/E that’s still under 11x. 7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy With Your Tax Refund PHM has a ‘B’ rating in my Portfolio Grader. Homebuilding Stocks to Buy: Meritage Homes (MTH) Source: Shutterstock Launched in 1985 in Arizona, MTH is now in various key markets in eight other states from the Carolinas to California, mostly across the South and Southwest. It also builds active adult communities and tends to build for the mid- to upscale markets. While its California properties and some of its other properties are feeders to prime markets, there are also plenty of fast-growing markets it’s involved in, like Nashville, Austin, Denver and Charlotte. It has become one of the top stocks to buy recently because it’s a bit less well known than others, but it has a solid history and is making its mark with its focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing. That’s a big and growing sector. Up 27% year to date, MTH stock still has a P/E just below 10x. The stock has a ‘B’ rating in my Portfolio Grader. Toll Brothers (TOL) Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com Founded in 1967 by a father and two sons who saw the potential building homes on a sizable scale, TOL is now the No. 5 builder in the U.S. and certainly has bragging rights to the highest average selling price — $849,000 with options upgrades of $183,000. It’s an upscale homebuilder, which is a very good market to be in right now since many wealthy people are deploying their cash into real estate rather than having it sit around the bank earning little. It’s now in 24 states nationwide, in the top markets in the best neighborhoods. It also builds multi-family dwellings as well as townhouses for buyers looking to minimize their footprints or buy rental investment properties. Catering to the upscale market is never a bad idea since this sector usually is the last to change its buying habits when a downturn happens. And lower prices are even a better opportunity to upscale buyers that still want to buy. Not surprisingly, this has been one of the top stocks to buy in 2021. It’s up 46% year to date, and trades at a P/E of 16x, which is higher than most of its peers, but significantly lower than the average growth stock in the markets. 7 Health-Focused ETFs To Buy Now For the Post-Covid Future TOL stock has a ‘B’ rating in my Portfolio Grader. Homebuilding Stocks to Buy: Tri Pointe Group (TPH) One of the newer builders on the list, TPH has acquired a number of builders since its inception in 2009 (it went public in 2013). It currently operates premium homes (attached and detached) and developments in 10 states and Washington, D.C., with 117 communities in those states. Located in key strategic markets across the U.S. — Washington, California, Nevada, Arizona, Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Maryland, DC and Virginia — it specializes in higher-end homes in established and expanding markets where people are moving from bigger cities or moving up from smaller properties. The average sale price of a TPH home is $634,000. TPH also finances its properties, which also allows it to generate income off the backend of its home sales. TPH stock is up 40% year to date, since this demographic is usually where the first stocks to buy appear, yet its current P/E still has yet to break 10x. The stock has a ‘B’ rating in my Portfolio Grader. On the date of publication, Louis Navellier has positions in MDC, MTH, and TOL in this article.
