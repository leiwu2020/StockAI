Companies that are expected to report earnings before the market opens include AstroNova (ALOT), BlueCity Holdings (BLCT), and Signet Jewelers Limited (SIG). Beyond Air Inc (XAIR), Dave & Busters Entertainment (PLAY), and Navigator Holdings (NVGS) are expected to report after the market close.



Ocugen Inc (OCGN) was the most actively traded stock in pre-market trading as well as the biggest laggard, as the stock plummeted 30% at the time of writing.  



Recently, the biopharmaceutical company revealed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) proposal to the company to submit a biologics license application (BLA) for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, COVAXIN, instead of an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for COVAXIN for now.



Based on the U.S. regulator’s feedback related to the Master File that Ocugen had submitted, Ocugen now needs to pursue a BLA submission instead of a EUA application for its vaccine candidate, and probably provide additional information and data as well. It is expected that additional clinical trial data might be required to support the BLA submission, the company said.



Ocugen CEO Dr. Shankar Musunuri commented, “Although we were close to finalizing our EUA application for submission, we received a recommendation from the FDA to pursue a BLA path. While this will extend our timelines, we are committed to bringing COVAXIN to the US. This differentiated vaccine is a critical tool to include in our national arsenal given its potential to address the SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the delta variant, and given the unknowns about what will be needed to protect US population in the long term.”



Medley Management (MDLY) was the biggest gainer as the stock jumped 81.3% at the time of writing. The capital market company has no fundamental news in support of the trading sentiment.



In earnings news, United Natural Foods (UNFI), the distributor of organic and specialty foods in the United States and Canada, posted lower-than-expected fiscal third-quarter revenues.



Revenues of $6.62 billion missed the consensus estimate of $6.82 billion and declined 5.9% year-over-year.



Meanwhile, the company reported adjusted earnings of $0.94 per share, surpassing analysts’ expectations of $0.88 per share, but dropped 29.3% from the same quarter last year.



United CEO Steven L. Spinner said, “We continue to focus on helping our customers operate their businesses and meet the needs of their shoppers through our differentiated business model. As the industry and economic backdrop continue to evolve, UNFI remains well positioned for future growth. Fiscal 2020 was a record year for UNFI and fiscal 2021 is on-track to set another record. Looking ahead, we fully expect fiscal 2022 to be even better than this year.”



Meanwhile, the American processed food and snack company Campbell Soup Company (CPB) recorded weak fiscal Q3 results. Net sales of $1.98 billion slumped 11% year-over-year, missing analysts’ expectations of $2 billion. Additionally, adjusted earnings came in at $0.57 per share, lower than the consensus estimates of $0.66 per share, and down 31%.



Campbell CEO Mark Clouse said, “While we recognized the third quarter would be challenging due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic a year ago, we faced additional headwinds. Our results were impacted by a rising inflationary environment, short-term increases in supply chain costs, and some executional pressures as we continued to advance our transformation agenda, primarily in our snacks division. We are confident that these are all addressable, and we are taking appropriate actions, including putting pricing in place for the next fiscal year.”



In M&A news, nVent Electric (NVT), a global provider of electrical connection and protection solutions inked a cash deal to acquire CIS Global LLC for $200 million. The deal, which awaits certain customary conditions and regulatory approvals, is likely to close by the third quarter of this year. CIS Global provides power and server rack-mount slide products to data centers and networking industries.



nVent’s Enclosures President Joe Ruzynski said, “We are excited about the strong team, technology and innovation at CIS Global. Combined with our Enclosures solutions, we can help data centers across the world improve operational efficiency and optimize energy utilization with leading technologies in heat and power management, both critical for electrical resiliency.”



Meanwhile, Entravision Communications (EVC), a global media, marketing, and technology company, has agreed to snap up the digital marketing and branding company MediaDonuts. Headquartered in Singapore, MediaDonuts operates in seven countries in the Asia-Pacific region and caters to over 500 technology and consumer brand clients. The transaction is expected to close on or around July 1. The Southeast Asian market represents a major opportunity for Entravison, as 400 million of its 700 million consumers are digitally connected.



Entravision CEO Walter Ulloa said, “This acquisition is a natural fit with the overall digital and global transformation strategy of our business. Entravision has always focused on providing advertising solutions in high growth markets and partnering with the strongest media and technology platforms in the world. We believe that the incorporation of MediaDonuts into the Entravision platform adds leadership, sales operations, and digital offerings that will further propel our digital efforts.”



In other news, United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) revealed the company’s Strategic Priorities, 2023 financial targets, and new ESG Targets at its investor conference. UPS is the largest global package delivery company and provider of supply chain management solutions.



United Parcel’s Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven strategy reflects its target of a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 50 or higher by 2023, its intention to rise in the “likelihood to recommend” target to 80% or more, and the company's goal to consistently enhance shareholder value through dividend payouts and share buybacks.

The quarterly results were impacted due to the increasing inflationary landscape, short-term rise in supply-chain expenses and some executional issues, the American processed food and snack company said.



Net sales of $1.98 billion decreased 11% from the year-ago period. Analysts had expected the company to report net sales of $2 billion.



Earnings came in at $0.57 per share, which missed the consensus estimates of $0.66 per share. Furthermore, earnings were down 31% year-over-year.



Campbell CEO Mark Clouse said, ""While we recognized the third quarter would be challenging due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic a year ago, we faced additional headwinds.

Clouse added, “Nearly three-quarters of our portfolio gained or held share in the quarter, with most of our core categories having grown at higher rates than pre-pandemic levels.” (See Campbell Soup stock analysis on TipRanks)



For fiscal year 2021, Campbell Soup lowered its adjusted earnings per share to $2.90-$2.93 from $3.03-$3.11. The consensus estimate for the same is pegged at $3.07.



Furthermore, the company now expects net sales to decline between 3% and 3.5% compared to a 2.5-3.5% decrease expected earlier.



Following the fiscal Q3 earnings release, Jefferies analyst Robert Dickerson maintained a Hold rating but lowered the price target to $50 (8.9% upside potential).



Dickerson said, “Although the margin pressure wasn’t driven by longer-term structural issues and should improve through fiscal year 2022 as costs dissipate and pricing enters the P&L, we believe the stock will remain flattish until management can show improved profitability via pricing, rolling-off COVID-driven impacts, and improved snacks potential.”



The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 2 Buys and 3 Holds. The Campbell Soup average analyst price target of $53.2 implies 15.9% upside potential from the current levels. Shares have decreased 6.2% over the past year.



Campbell Soup has scored a 4 of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock is likely to perform in line with market averages.

Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed. Campbell Soup Company’s (CPB) President of Meals and Beverages, Chris Foley, said, “The sale of the Plum Organics baby food brand is part of our ongoing strategic process to create even greater focus on driving growth in the division’s core categories of soup, sauces and beverages.” Harry Overly, CEO and President of Sun-Maid Growers of California, commented, “We are excited to welcome Plum Organics’ nutritious line of baby, toddler and kids’ food products to our imaginative world of delicious, whole fruit snacks.” (See Campbell Soup stock analysis on TipRanks) Plum Organics was acquired by Campbell Soup in 2013. Its products cater to the nutritional requirements of babies, toddlers and kids and are certified organic and non-GMO. The transaction is expected to close in spring 2021. This month, RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $59 price target (17.4% upside potential). Modi said, “CPB shares have performed well sinceMark Clouse joined the company as CEO. Most of the improvement has been a function of improving business trends against easy compares and a much more consistent delivery on earnings expectations.” Modi further added, “However, we would argue that we are still in the early stages of a recovery. Yes, it will likely be choppy as stepped-up spending and reduced promotional intensity (against lots of promotions a year ago) create quarterly volatility, but we believe the company’s improved capabilities around consumer insights and R&D are just now starting to take hold.” Turning to the rest of the Street, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating alongside an average analyst price target of $52.57 (4.6% upside potential), based on 3 Buys, 3 Holds and 1 Sell. Shares have gained about 10.4% over the past year.

(NYSE:CPB) share price is at $47.52, after a 0.61% drop. Over the past month, the stock spiked by 1.17%, but over the past year, it actually decreased by 3.57%. With questionable short-term performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio. The stock is currently above from its 52 week low by 16.76%. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for investors trying to diversify their portfolio with Food Products stocks, and capitalize on the lower share price observed over the year. The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.

Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 98.15 in the Food Products industry, Campbell Soup Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 19.87. Shareholders might be inclined to think that the stock might perform worse than its industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued. P/E ratio is not always a great indicator of the company's performance. Depending on the earnings makeup of a company, investors can become unable to attain key insights from trailing earnings.

Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Campbell Soup has. Campbell Soup's Debt Based on Campbell Soup's financial statement as of March 10, 2021, long-term debt is at $5.00 billion and current debt is at $1.02 billion, amounting to $6.02 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $946.00 million in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $5.08 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Campbell Soup has $12.50 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.48. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?
