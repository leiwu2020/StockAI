The outstanding performance was driven by double-digit growth in sales. McCormick’s (MKC) 1Q adjusted earnings of $0.72 per share increased 33% on a year-over-year basis and handily outpaced the Street estimates of $0.58 per share. Adjusted revenues jumped 20% to $1.48 billion, topping analysts’ expectations of $1.38 billion, mainly due to growth in both the Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments. The company’s Consumer segment sales surged 32% year-over-year, driven mainly by increased demand resulting from the stay-at-home environment. Flavor Solutions segment sales grew 3%, fueled by acquisitions and higher demand from packaged food companies. McCormick CEO Lawrence E. Kurzius said, “We are well positioned for continued success and our 2021 outlook reflects another year of differentiated results while making additional investments for the future.” (See McCormick stock analysis on TipRanks) For fiscal 2021, the company expects sales to grow by 8% to 10% compared to 2020, up from the prior projection of 7% to 9%. Moreover, its adjusted earnings guidance range of $2.97-$3.02 per share came in ahead of analysts’ expectations of $2.95 and was revised upward from the prior assumption of $2.91 to $2.96 per share. Following the 1Q results, Jefferies analyst Robert Dickerson reiterated a Hold rating and a price target of $95 (5.4% upside potential). Overall, the stock has a Hold consensus rating based on 3 Holds versus 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $87.67 implies 2.7% downside potential from current levels. Shares have increased almost 26% over the past year.

McCormick posted net sales of $1.48 billion, up from $1.21 billion a year prior and above the $1.38 billion that analysts tracked by FactSet had been projecting. ""We are capitalizing on accelerating consumer trends, particularly the sustained shift to cooking more at home, increased digital engagement, clean and flavorful eating, and trusted brands, which we are confident will continue to persist even beyond the pandemic,"" Chief Executive Lawrence Kurzius said in a release. For the full fiscal year, McCormick expects to grow sales by 8% to 10%, above its prior projection for 7% to 9% growth. The company anticipates organic growth in both its consumer and flavor solutions businesses.
