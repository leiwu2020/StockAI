Shares of the American bank holding company climbed 3.6% in Tuesday’s trading session, following the earnings release.



Quarterly earnings stood at $1.44 per share, beating the Street’s estimates of $1.09. Also, it compares favorably with $0.53 per share reported in the same period last year.



Total revenue decreased 8% year-over-year to $1.61 billion and lagged analysts’ expectations of $1.63 billion.



Net interest income (NII) fell 3% to $1.1 billion on 16 basis points contraction in net interest margin. Noninterest income declined 18% to $485 million. Lower mortgage banking income was partly offset by rise in capital market and wealth income. (See Citizens stock chart on TipRanks)



Credit provision benefit was $213 million for the second quarter on improvement in the economic outlook and strong credit performance across retail and commercial loan portfolios.



Chairman and CEO of Citizens Bruce Van Saun said, “We saw modest loan growth during the quarter, and expect that to accelerate in the second half as the economy continues to grow and excess liquidity is redeployed.”



The company expects its NII to increase 2% to 3% in the third quarter with average loans up slightly. Also, fee income is anticipated to rise 2% to 4% sequentially.



On July 16, Citigroup analyst Jill Shea initiated coverage on the stock with a Hold rating. Shea noted that improving return on average tangible common equity with higher short-end rates are positives for regional banks.



Based on the 9 Buys and 3 Holds, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus. The average Citizens price target of $51.64 implies 21% upside potential from current levels. Shares have gained 67% over the past year.

With this pivot to Asia, the London-based lender will sell about 90 of its US branches to Citizens Bank, a unit of Citizens Financial Group, and Cathay Bank, a Los Angeles-based lender focused on the Chinese-American community. The purchase of HSBC's bicoastal US branches will bolster the existing footprints of Citizens and Cathay. Here's what you need to know about Citizens Bank and Cathay Bank. What is Citizens Bank? The retail banking arm of Rhode Island-based Citizens Financial Group is one of the oldest financial institutions in the US, tracing its roots to High Street Bank, founded in 1828. The predecessors of JPMorgan and Citibank are among the few lenders who are older, founded in New York City in 1799 and 1812, respectively. Citizens grew rapidly in the late eighties through more than two dozen deals following its acquisition by Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS) - now NatWest Group - in 1988. It expanded from 29 branches in Rhode Island in 1981 to about 1,000 in 11 states in New England, the mid-Atlantic region and the Midwest. today. As of March 31, Citizen had US$187.2 billion in assets. It went public in the US in 2015 after it was spun off from RBS and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

Cathay Bank is a much younger lender, opening its doors in 1962 to serve the Chinese-American community in Los Angeles. (It claims to be the oldest operating bank in the US founded by Chinese Americans.) The bank, a subsidiary of Cathay General Bancorp, has more than 60 branches in nine US states, as well as a single branch in Hong Kong and representative offices in Beijing, Shanghai and Taipei. Cathay opened its first office in Hong Kong in 1985 as part of its international expansion and began trading on Nasdaq five years later. The Hong Kong branch is located on the 30th floor of an office tower overlooking Victoria Harbour in Tsim Sha Tsui, and customers in Hong Kong require a referral from one of its US branches. It competes with the likes of East West Bank, Bank of Hope and Hanmi Bank in serving the Asian community in California and other ethnic groups across the US. As of March 31, the bank had total assets of US$19.2 billion. What does the HSBC deal mean for Citizens Bank? Citizens Bank is buying 80 of HSBC's retail bank branches on the US East Coast, with about 800,000 customers, US$9.2 billion in deposits and US$2.2 billion of outstanding loans. More than 60 of these are in the metropolitan area around New York City and will be rebranded Citizens branches after the deal closes next year. ""This transaction provides us with an attractive entry into the important New York City metro, Washington DC, and Southeast Florida markets,"" Citizens Financial's chairman and chief executive Bruce Van Saun said in a statement. ""With a sizeable customer base and a solid deposit franchise, this acquisition will serve as a springboard for our consumer national expansion strategy."" Citizens said it would pay a 2 per cent premium on deposits in the business at closing, which is expected in first-quarter 2022. What is Cathay Bank getting out of the HSBC deal? Cathay will buy 10 HSBC branches on the US West Coast, serving about 50,000 customers with US$1 billion in deposits and US$800,000 in outstanding loans. ""This transaction will broaden the reach of our Northern and Southern California branch network,"" Cathay General Bancorp's executive chairman Dunson K. Cheng said in a statement. ""As we continue to grow and expand, the ability to provide our clients added ease in accessing banking services is a significant step in our journey."" Cathay and HSBC did not disclose the terms of transaction, but Cathay said it would be about 2 per cent accretive to Cathay General's earnings per share on a run-rate basis, excluding any transaction or restructuring costs.

HSBC is focusing on wealthy customers and international companies looking to conduct business in the US as part of its latest revamp of its American operations under CEO Noel Quinn. That means customers with less than US$75,000 in their accounts or small businesses with less than US$5 million in annual revenue will no longer be served by the bank in the US, after the deal closes next year. Those customers, much like the HSBC employees working at the affected branches, will transition to Citizens Bank and Cathay Bank following the transactions. Both banks intend to rebrand the former HSBC branches as soon as the deal closes. HSBC currently has about 148 branches in the US. It intends to keep 20 to 25 of the physical locations open, transforming them into wealth centres to serve affluent and high-net-worth clients. The remaining branches, between 35 and 40 of them, will be closed. The sale is an important step towards becoming a ""more focused, simpler and sustainably profitable organisation,"" said HSBC's chief executive for the US and the Americas, Michael Roberts. ""A strong, internationally connected US business is an important part of HSBC's value proposition, and we are excited to be focusing the US business in areas of competitive strength,"" Roberts said.

The London-based bank said it would sell its banking operations for the mass market and small businesses on the East Coast to Citizens Bank, part of Citizens Financial Group, and sell its West Coast retail operations to California's Cathay Bank.

HSBC said it would retain a small network of about 20 to 25 brick-and-mortar locations, which will be repurposed into wealth centres to service affluent and high-net-worth international customers. It will wind down the remaining 35 to 40 branches. ﻿ Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

""They are good businesses, but we lacked the scale to compete,"" Quinn said in a statement regarding the sale. ""Our continued presence in the US is key to our international network and an important contributor to our growth plans."" Some investors argued last year that the lender should leave the US entirely after the bank found itself embroiled in rising Sino-US tensions, particularly after its top executive in Asia publicly supported a controversial national security law enacted by Beijing for Hong Kong last year. Quinn has previously argued that the US remains a necessary market for its aspirations as an international bank, but needed to be smaller and more focused. ""We remain a global international bank. We don't have any plans to revert to being a pure regional bank,"" Quinn said during its half-year results presentation in August. ""There is a role for an international bank, particularly one that is capable of bridging the East and the West."" HSBC first entered the US retail banking market when it acquired a controlling stake in Marine Midland Bank in 1980. It took full ownership of the Buffalo, NY-based lender seven years later. HSBC CEO Noel Quinn Photo: AFP/HSBC alt=HSBC CEO Noel Quinn Photo: AFP/HSBC HSBC's US retail banking business struggled to be profitable in recent years as interest rates fell to historic lows, affecting the ability of banks to make money on traditional lending and other products tied to rates. HSBC also lacked the necessary scale to compete with its bigger American rivals. It currently has 148 American branches - JPMorgan Chase, by comparison, opened 158 new branches alone in the US last year. Under Quinn, HSBC has improved the profitability of its American operations. Its US Wealth and Personal Banking segment - formerly its retail and wealth management business - reported its first pre-tax profit in 14 quarters in the first quarter of this year. But, the drag of low interest rates, combined with its small footprint, made the retail operations a less attractive business to maintain. The bank said in February that it was exploring ""organic and inorganic options"" for its US retail bank and was in negotiations regarding a potential sale of its French business as part of a broader shift of capital from underperforming businesses in Europe and the US to Asia, where it makes the bulk of its revenue. That same month, the bank announced that it would hire 5,000 wealth planners and invest US$6 billion in its latest pivot to Asia, which includes relocating several of its global business leaders. The bank said in May it was on track to hire 1,000 of those roles this year. HSBC is betting on rising affluence in Asia, particularly in the Greater Bay Area, and sees scaling back its US operations as another step in that greater focus on wealth. ""The US plays a large role in HSBC's Asia growth strategy, particularly in support of our ambitions to become the leading wealth manager in Asia,"" said Greg Hingston, HSBC's Asia Pacific regional head of wealth and personal banking. ""Our refreshed strategy in the US will allow us to better serve the needs of our international wealth clients, who continue to consider the US for international education, property, investment diversification, career and family mobility and business expansion, among others.""

Client need a referral from US bank branch managers. Photo: Georgina Lee Following the sale, HSBC will no longer offer services to American retail-banking clients with balances of less than US$75,000 and small businesses with less than US$5 million in revenue. It will continue to serve more affluent and wealthy international customers in the US, as well as companies with large international businesses. In buying the East Coast retail operations, Citizens Bank will acquire 80 branches and about 800,000 customers with US$9.2 billion in deposits and US$2.2 billion in outstanding loans. Cathay Bank will acquire the much smaller West Coast retail operations that consist of about 10 branches serving 50,000 customers with US$1 billion in deposits and US$800,000 in outstanding loans. Cathay Bank operates a sole branch in Hong Kong on the thirtieth floor of an office block overlooking Victoria Harbour. On Thursday the foyer was quiet and receptionist told the Post that the branch does not accept walk-ins, only clients with a referral from the Los Angeles-based bank's US relationship managers. HSBC employees hit by the restructuring will transfer to Citizens Bank or Cathay Bank, or else transition to new roles within HSBC, according to a person familiar with the British bank's plans. The transactions are expected to close by the first-quarter of next year and HSBC said it expects to incur US$100,000 of pre-tax costs in connection with the sales. HSBC said it does not expect to have a ""significant gain or loss"" on the sales.

It’s closing 35 to 40 other branches. The bank expects a pretax cost of $100 million from the transactions.The move is part of a larger plan by HSBC to invest more in Asia, where it’s focused on banking the region’s wealthy, as the lender also looks at exiting businesses in Europe. The bank has announced it will cut about 35,000 jobs globally to boost profitability after years of struggling with rock-bottom interest rates.“They are good businesses, but we lacked the scale to compete,” Chief Executive Officer Noel Quinn said in the statement. “Our continued presence in the US is key to our international network and an important contributor to our growth plans.”Shares were little changed at 8:15 a.m. in London.HSBC has one of the largest U.S. businesses of any non-American bank, partly a result of its ill-fated acquisition of Household International in 2003, the subprime lender that ended up costing the company billions of dollars in writedowns.The transaction will see HSBC exit mass-market retail banking in the U.S. and will focus on offering banking and wealth management services to an international customer base of about 300,000 wealthy clients.“Our refreshed strategy in the U.S. will allow us to better serve the needs of our international wealth clients,” said Greg Hingston, regional head of Wealth and Personal Banking in Asia Pacific.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:HSBC’s complex exit of U.S. domestic mass-market retail banking via disposals (90 branches), branch repositioning and wind down is a welcome and long-awaited step in its strategic repositioning. The minimal financial impact may disappoint some who had hoped for sale gains, but given the complexity, a piecemeal approach to U.S. repositioning is needed.-- Jonathan Tyce, BI banking analystHSBC is in the midst of paring its global ambitions, diverting capital from Europe and the U.S. to fund its expansion of its Asian businesses. It’s also in the process of selling its French retail unit. The sale, which the bank started preparing in 2019, is now in the final stretch as Cerberus is the last remaining candidate to acquire the asset.The lender agreed to sell 80 of its branches to Citizens Financial Group Inc., a Providence, Rhode Island-based regional lender. Citizens will pick up about $9 billion in deposits and $2.2 billion in loans as part of the deal. The price wasn’t disclosed.Cathay Bank agreed to buy HSBC’s west coast domestic mass market and retail businesses, including 10 branches and about 50,000 customer relationships. The sale is expected to close by the first quarter of 2022, subject to regulatory approval.“These transactions, whilst very small in the context of HSBC group, should contribute to streamlining the group,” Jefferies analysts said in a note Thursday. “Investor pushback is likely to major on the fact that in these transactions, HSBC is not fully exiting U.S. retail.”(Adds details on deal and strategy throughout.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=20b0a8e338ae0643927a2a5c776aab2830f2daa496d70e8fa97fe6b7a7f25226
