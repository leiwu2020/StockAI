(NYSE: ITW) today reported its first quarter 2021 results. “We saw continued improvement in the demand environment across a broad cross section of our business portfolio in the first quarter and our teams around the world responded,” said E. Scott Santi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “The combination of the ‘Win the Recovery’ actions we initiated over the course of the past year, the foundational strength of ITW’s 80/20 front-to-back business system, and our continuing progress in executing our long-term enterprise strategy allowed us to meet our customers’ increasing needs while delivering excellent profitability leverage, as evidenced by our 19 percent earnings growth, 45 percent incremental margins, and 120 basis points of margin benefit from enterprise initiatives in the quarter. While a number of significant issues and uncertainties remain on the path to recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic globally, I am confident that ITW is well-positioned to both seize the opportunities and deal with the challenges that lie ahead as we move through the balance of 2021.” First Quarter 2021 ResultsFirst quarter revenue of $3.5 billion increased 10 percent versus the prior year period, as organic revenue grew six percent, or eight percent when equalizing for one less shipping day in 2021 versus 2020, and foreign currency translation impact was favorable by four percent. Product Line Simplification (PLS) activities reduced organic revenue growth by 20 basis points. GAAP EPS of $2.11 increased 19 percent. Operating income increased 19 percent to $905 million. Operating margin was 25.5 percent, an increase of 190 basis points with enterprise initiatives contributing 120 basis points. Free cash flow was $541 million, 81 percent of net income and in line with typical seasonality. After-tax return on invested capital improved to 32.1 percent compared to 27.0 percent in the prior year period. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 22.4 percent. Six of our seven segments delivered strong organic growth in the quarter, led by Construction Products which was up 13 percent. Test & Measurement and Electronics was up 11 percent, Polymers & Fluids up nine percent, Automotive OEM up eight percent, Specialty Products up seven percent, and Welding up six percent. While organic revenue in Food Equipment was down ten percent in Q1, we saw meaningful improvement in demand trends sequentially versus the 19 percent decline the business experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020. 2021 GuidanceProjecting full year results based on demand rates exiting the first quarter, the company now expects full year GAAP EPS of $8.20 to $8.60 per share, an increase of 27 percent at the midpoint. Organic growth is expected to be in the range of 10 to 12 percent. Revenue is expected to grow in the range of 12 to 14 percent as foreign currency translation at current exchange rates is projected to increase revenue by approximately two percent. PLS impact is forecasted to be approximately 50 basis points. Operating margin is expected to be in the range of 25 to 26 percent, with enterprise initiatives contributing approximately 100 basis points. Free cash flow is expected to be greater than 100 percent of net income. The company plans to repurchase approximately $1 billion of its shares and expects an effective tax rate of 23 to 24 percent. Guidance excludes any impact from the previously announced acquisition of the MTS Test & Simulation business. Non-GAAP Measures This earnings release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached supplemental reconciliation schedule. The estimated guidance of Free Cash Flow conversion rate is based on assumptions that are difficult to predict, and a reconciliation of estimated Free Cash Flow to the most directly comparable GAAP measure has been omitted due to the unreasonable efforts required in connection with such a reconciliation and the lack of availability of reliable forward-looking cash flow and operating information.

Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is performing up to par in the current session. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 9.64%. The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's EPS. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future.

Illinois Tool Works Inc. has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 40.44 of the Machinery industry.

Shares of the industrial products and equipment manufacturer closed 2.6% higher on Friday. Illinois Tool’s (ITW) 4Q earnings of $2.02 per share exceeded the Street estimates of $1.79 and increased 7.5% year-over-year, as its operating margin expanded by 170 basis points to a “record” 25.4%. The company’s 4Q revenues showed marginal growth of 0.2% to $3.48 and surpassed analysts’ expectations of $3.33 billion. Organic revenues fell 0.9%, while divestitures had a negative impact of 0.7% on total sales. However, foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted revenues by 1.8% during the reported quarter. As for 2021, Illinois Tool projects earnings in the range of $7.60-$8 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 15%-21%. Analysts expect 2021 earnings to come in at $7.68 per share. Illinois Tool forecasted 2021 revenues to grow in the range of 9%-12% year-over-year, driven by currency tailwinds of about 2%. Further, the company plans to repurchase about $1 billion worth of shares this year. (See Illinois Tool Works stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the results, Robert W. Baird analyst Mircea Dobre raised the stock’s price target to $214 (5.8% upside potential) from $210. The analyst was positive about the company's “good execution” during 4Q and cited its strong operating margins, though organic sales were ""nearly flat."" However, Dobre maintained a Hold rating as believes that there will be ""limiting factors"" to the company’s margin expansion into the second half of the year as demand normalizes. The Street has a cautious outlook with a Hold consensus rating based on 6 Holds, 3 Buys and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $218.40 implies upside potential of about 8% to current levels. Shares have gained about 13.9% in one year.

Shares of the industrial products and equipment manufacturer closed 2.6% higher on Friday.Illinois Tool’s (ITW) 4Q earnings of $2.02 per share exceeded the Street estimates of $1.79 and increased 7.5% year-over-year, as its operating margin expanded by 170 basis points to a “record” 25.4%.The company’s 4Q revenues showed marginal growth of 0.2% to $3.48 and surpassed analysts’ expectations of $3.33 billion. Organic revenues fell 0.9%, while divestitures had a negative impact of 0.7% on total sales. However, foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted revenues by 1.8% during the reported quarter.As for 2021, Illinois Tool projects earnings in the range of $7.60-$8 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 15%-21%. Analysts expect 2021 earnings to come in at $7.68 per share. Illinois Tool forecasted 2021 revenues to grow in the range of 9%-12% year-over-year, driven by currency tailwinds of about 2%. Further, the company plans to repurchase about $1 billion worth of shares this year. (See Illinois Tool Works stock analysis on TipRanks)Following the results, Robert W. Baird analyst Mircea Dobre raised the stock’s price target to $214 (5.8% upside potential) from $210. The analyst was positive about the company's “good execution” during 4Q and cited its strong operating margins, though organic sales were ""nearly flat.""  However, Dobre maintained a Hold rating as believes that there will be ""limiting factors"" to the company’s margin expansion into the second half of the year as demand normalizes.The Street has a cautious outlook with a Hold consensus rating based on 6 Holds, 3 Buys and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $218.40 implies upside potential of about 8% to current levels. Shares have gained about 13.9% in one year.Related News:Skechers Dips 4.6% On 4Q Profit MissMonmouth’s 1Q AFFO Disappoints; Shares DropPinterest 4Q Earnings Beat Estimates; Shares Pop 11.7% Pre-Market",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=af74fcb83e311af00ad2e0ca6d57ebf03ca782926c490836931d847576902074
