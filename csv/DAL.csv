After a weak 2020 due to the outbreak of the pandemic, demand in the airline industry is gradually picking up, and the industry has begun to rebound.



This nascent recovery recently enabled U.S. legacy Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL) to post better-than-expected Q2 results. Following the earnings announcement, shares of the company rose 1.6% on July 15 to close at $41.35.



The Q2 results – while down compared to 2019 levels – showed solid sequential gains and came in above analysts' expectations. Adjusted revenues of $6.35 billion fell 49% compared to the same quarter in 2019 but surged 76% sequentially. Revenue exceeded the consensus estimate of $6.2 billion. Meanwhile, the adjusted loss per share was $1.07 in Q2, better than analysts’ expectations of a loss of $1.40 per share.



Savanthi Syth of Raymond James sees DAL in a fundamentally sound position after the company reported its Q2 earnings. The analyst upgraded DAL from Hold to Buy, stating that the stock was ""too hard to ignore at current levels.""



Her $58 price target implies upside potential of approximately 41% over the next 12 months. (See Delta Air Lines stock charts on TipRanks)



Syth is upbeat about the travel industry's recovery. She is of the opinion that demand in the travel industry will continue to improve shortly, driven by the ongoing vaccine distribution in the second half of 2021.



In comparison to recreational trips, Syth is more optimistic about business demand improving in the near future. She said in a note to investors that demand for corporate business travel has returned to 40% of June 2019 levels and is predicted to grow to 60% in September and to as high as 80% by the end of the fourth quarter.



Based on Delta's present fleet, Syth believes it will be tough for the airline to reach 2019 capacity. To address this, Delta has been working on expanding its fleet through aircraft purchases and leasing agreements. 



The analyst expects Delta to provide a “longer-term capacity growth outlook” at its Investor Day to be held on December 16.



Looking forward, “Delta’s balanced capital deployment strategy”, “structural advantages,” and ability “to grow a higher margin business” should sustain its “relative operational and financial leadership versus legacy peers,” said the analyst.



Therefore, based on encouraging travel trends in recent times along with Delta’s debt reduction initiatives, the analyst believes that shares reflect an “attractive risk-reward” profile at current levels.



On TipRanks, DAL has a Strong Buy consensus analyst rating based on 10 Buys and 3 Holds. The average DAL price target is $57.92, reflecting 12-month upside potential of 40.1%.

Earnings and revenue both surpassed analysts’ estimates driven by a rebound in business travel and the reopening of international markets.



Shares of the U.S. legacy airlines were down 1.6% on July 14 to close at $40.68.



The company reported an adjusted loss of $1.07 per share, beating analysts’ expectations of a loss of $1.40 per share. Revenues of $7.13 billion exceeded the consensus estimate of $6.2 billion.



Importantly, the company reported a pre-tax profit of $776 million for the first time after five consecutive quarters of losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pre-tax profit was aided by a $1.5 billion benefit received from the federal payroll support program.



Delta’s load factor, or the percentage of seats sold, was 69%, up 24 bps from the previous quarter. (See DAL stock charts on TipRanks)



However, total Passenger Revenue declined 53% to $5.4 billion compared to the June quarter of 2019 due to lower scheduled capacity and the impact of the blocking of the middle seat through April 2021. 



Management said that domestic travel has completely recovered and returned to the pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, both business and international travel are on track towards recovery.



As a part of its fleet renewal initiative, the company recently announced that it will add pre-owned aircraft to its fleet, including seven Airbus A350s and twenty-nine 737-900ERs.   



Moreover, last month, Delta announced its plan to hire over 1,000 pilots by next summer.



Delta's CEO Ed Bastian commented, ""Looking forward, we are harnessing the power of our differentiated brand and resilient competitive advantages to drive towards sustainable profitability in the second half of 2021 and enable long-term value creation."" 



He further added, “With the recovery picking up steam, we are making investments to support our industry-leading operation.  We are also opportunistically acquiring aircraft and creating upside flexibility to accelerate our capacity restoration in 2022 and beyond in a capital-disciplined manner”.



Delta expects to be profitable in the second half of the year. However, for the upcoming third quarter, the company expects revenues to be down 30% to 35% versus the same quarter in 2019. It also expects capacity to be down 28% to 30% compared with the September 2019 quarter.



Following the results announcement, Bernstein analyst David Vernon maintained a Buy rating and the price target of $64 (57.3% upside potential) on the stock.



Vernon commented, “Guidance for back half revenue and profitability is constructive, as underlying demand trends remain intact, business travel is on the mend, and cost performance, if choppy, is pointing in the right direction.”



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 9 Buys and 2 Holds. The average Delta Airlines price target of $59.63 implies 46.6% upside potential to current levels.



TipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 86% Bullish on DAL, compared to a sector average of 70%.

Since April's highs, share prices have steadily declined over the last three months. Today, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL) will be the first major airline to report earnings during pre-market hours. (See Delta Air Lines stock charts on TipRanks) 



The ongoing saga is detailed by Savanthi Syth of Raymond James Financial, who wrote that the steady decline in share price can be attributed to rising jet fuel costs as demand goes up, Delta-variant COVID-19 fears, and a general rotation out of the sector by investors.  



Syth reiterated a Hold rating and did not declare a price target. She warned investors that although the company has a strong balance sheet, short-term headwinds may lie ahead, posing a challenge for serious gains in share price.  



The four-star analyst was enthusiastic that Delta had “the best capital execution” throughout the pandemic, and currently sits in a fiscally advantageous position. She added that due to updated CDC guidelines regarding leniency toward air travel, a domestic recovery in ticket sales could be faster than expected.  



As far as concerns surrounding the Delta-variant go, Syth argued that at most, it will only cause the airline a longer-term delay in international business. The new variant of the coronavirus has been surging around the world and is causing some localities to rethink travel restrictions.  



Jet fuel costs are dependent on global oil prices, which have increased significantly over the last three months. Delta Air Lines does however own its own oil refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania, but still saw its oil prices increase by more than 400% by early June since the year prior, Syth added.  



On TipRanks, DAL has an analyst rating consensus of Strong Buy, based on 8 Buy and 2 Hold ratings. The average Delta Air Lines price target is $59.29, reflecting a potential 12-month upside of 43.46%. The stock closed trading Tuesday at a price of $41.33 per share.
