Shares of BX and AIG have gained 3.7% and 7.5%, respectively.



The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021, subject to HSR approval and other customary closing conditions.



As per the terms of the deal, Blackstone and AIG are bonded in a long-term strategic asset management relationship under which Blackstone will, at first, manage $50 billion of Life & Retirement’s existing investment portfolio upon closing of the equity investment. The amount will gradually increase to $92.5 billion over a span of six years.



Along with this deal, Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust (BREIT), a perpetual-life real estate investment platform, has entered a cash deal to acquire AIG’s interests in a U.S. affordable housing portfolio for nearly $5.1 billion.



This transaction is likely to close in the fourth quarter of 2021. (See Blackstone stock chart on TipRanks)



President and COO of Blackstone Jon Gray will be joining the Life & Retirement Board of Directors. “We believe our leading private credit origination platform will play an important role to help meet long-term policyholder obligations while maintaining strong credit quality,"" Gray said.



On July 12, Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Bedell maintained a Hold rating on the stock and raised the price target to $86 from $79 (12.8% downside potential from the current level).



The analyst is of the opinion that improving organic growth trends, less pressure on fee rates and a ""generally constructive"" macro growth outlook will support Blackstone in Q3 earnings season.



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 9 Buys and 3 Holds. The average Blackstone price target stands at $93.36 and implies downside potential of 5.4% from current levels.



TipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 88% Bullish on BX, compared to the sector average of 70%.

Cornell, currently AIG’s deputy CIO, will take over, a company representative said in an email Thursday.Dachille is leaving after overhauling AIG’s portfolio during a period of tumult in the industry. He scaled back on expensive hedge fund holdings while scouting fresh ways to seek yield in a low interest rate environment. He was recruited to the insurer by former Chief Executive Officer Peter Hancock, who previously worked with Dachille at JPMorgan Chase & Co. to build the derivatives business.Dachille was co-treasurer and global head of proprietary trading at JPMorgan before he joined Zurich Capital Markets as president. He then co-founded First Principles, which oversaw about $10 billion when AIG acquired it six years ago.Cornell joined AIG in 1994, eventually rising to deputy CIO in 2013. Prior to assuming that role, he was the insurer’s North American regional chief investment officer.(Updates with Cornell’s prior experience in last paragraph.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1ef579457288c084e3fa7a9efbcfe692c16ae9732f7b3cb9ebc977ed2f4ed629

While not technically a hedge fund, the blowup of Bill Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management has sent shock waves through Wall Street, triggering billions of dollars of losses for banks and scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission.The closed portion of the FSOC meeting included a presentation about hedge funds cutting their leverage during the pandemic-fueled turmoil in March 2020 and how that might have triggered “price declines in certain financial markets,” Treasury said in a statement. The council also discussed more recent hedge fund activity, according to the statement, without offering specifics or naming any firms.Wild TradingIn addition to Archegos, another high-profile development involving private funds that captured Wall Street’s attention this year was wild trading in GameStop Corp. and other so-called meme stocks. Some hedge funds, including Gabe Plotkin’s Melvin Capital Management, that had bet against the companies got slammed with losses in January after retail investors drove the shares to astronomical levels.The Treasury statement noted that Yellen personally requested the revival of the panel’s hedge fund working group, which hasn’t been in operation since 2016.FSOC, holding its first meeting since Democrats took the White House, is working to reinvigorate financial oversight after it fell into a lull during the Trump administration. Yellen said the council was also studying new rules for money-market mutual funds and would delve deeply into climate-related issues.Global warming “is an existential threat to our environment, and it poses a tremendous risk to our country’s financial stability,” Yellen said, adding that the increasing frequency and intensity of storms could lead to severe disruptions in food and water supplies and cause increased unrest around the world.Over the first few months of Biden’s presidency, several financial agencies have moved to increase their focus on how a warming planet could threaten the economy. Allison Herren Lee, the SEC’s acting chair, has set up an enforcement task force to focus on environmental-related issues and signaled that corporations may soon have to disclose more to shareholders about business risks. Meanwhile, Rostin Behnam, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission acting chief, said this month that he was establishing a unit to examine how derivatives can be used to address climate change.‘More Resilient’In her remarks, Yellen called on FSOC to review the critical role that open-end mutual funds play in financing the economy. She also said the council must explore “vulnerabilities” in the U.S. Treasury market that were exposed by the pandemic.“We also must strengthen the Treasury market itself and make it more resilient to future disruptions,” Yellen said.FSOC, created in response to the 2008 financial crisis, is tasked with spotting risks that could cause another crash. Set up under the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, it has the authority to call out firms and industry practices as “systemically important” -- a label that brings stricter rules and heightened oversight by the Federal Reserve.The council’s members include the heads of the Fed, SEC and CFTC, making it a forum for regulators to coordinate their supervision of banks, asset managers, hedge funds and other finance companies.While FSOC is expected to be much tougher during the Biden administration, Yellen hasn’t always sided with Democratic lawmakers eager for a clampdown on Wall Street. Last week, she sparred with Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren over whether BlackRock Inc., the world’s biggest asset manager, should face designation by the council. And when Yellen led the Fed in 2017, she voted along with other panel members to remove insurer American International Group Inc.’s risk label.(Updates with Treasury statement, starting in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=8795672b6bbf5ad38a99e39b0d64f9d4c89bd1c7798fd689a14a9a242c106146

What Happened? On this day in 2009, the U.S. government committed another $30 billion to bail out American International Group Inc (NYSE: AIG). Where The Market Was: The S&P 500 was trading at 700.8 and the Dow closed the day at 6763.29. What Else Was Going On In The World? In 2009, Barack Obama became the first African American president in U.S. history and controversial pop music legend Michael Jackson died at the age of 50. The average U.S. income was $39,423. Another Financial Crisis Bailout: March 2009 was the darkest time of the financial crisis. Americans looked on helplessly as big banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers collapsed and other big banks and institutions, such as AIG, appeared to only be surviving thanks to taxpayer support. On March 2, 2009, the government gave AIG a $30 billion lifeline prior to AIG’s fourth-quarter 2008 earnings report in which it was expected to report a staggering $60 billion loss. The government ended up providing a total of $62.5 billion to AIG to get it through the crisis. AIG's losses came after the downturn in the U.S. housing market triggered defaults on thousands of mortgages that were contained in collateralized debt obligations that AIG had insured. Unfortunately, AIG was unable to cover the losses on these CDOs, leaving the company on the hook for billions of dollars in payouts. It was touch and go for a while in 2009, but all’s well that ends well. AIG eventually paid back every cent of its bailout money, and U.S. taxpayers ultimately made a $5 billion profit off of the deal. Photo from Wikimedia.

Companies could explore a traditional IPO or a SPAC deal to bring their insurance companies public. Oscar Health: Health insurance company Oscar Health is planning to IPO in 2021. The company uses a technology-minded approach to offer small group and Medicare Advantage plans. Health plans are currently offered in 18 U.S. states with a focus on larger ones such as Florida, Texas and California. The company said 47% of its subscribers are active monthly users, including 44% of users over the age of 55. Oscar Health has 529,000 members and had revenue of $1.67 billion in fiscal 2020. Revenue in the prior year was $1.04 billion. Shares are expected to trade as OSCR on the NYSE. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is an investor in Oscar Health. Related Link: 10 IPOs To Watch Out For In 2021, Including Petco, Poshmark, Bumble, Coinbase And More Hippo: Homeowner insurance company Hippo raised $250 million in November and is considering going public, according to Bloomberg. The company was linked to a SPAC deal with Reinvent Technology Partners (NYSE: RTP), a SPAC led by Mark Pincus and Reid Hoffman. Hippo sells coverage online and is seeing fast growth. The company acquired Spinnaker Insurance recently and has expanded into more states over the last 12 months. Hippo acquired a home maintenance platform in 2019 that could help the company diversify beyond insurance. American International Group: Insurance company American International Group Inc (NYSE: AIG) is working on spinning off its life insurance and retirement business. The company is exploring options for selling a stake of this unit. New CEO Peter Zaffino told Bloomberg that the proceeds possibly could be used for share buybacks. “Our current expectation is that an initial disposition of 19.9% of life and retirement, whether through a minority IPO or sale to a third party, will generate net proceeds such that some portion can be used toward further share repurchases,” Zaffino said. Investors should watch to see if this unit becomes a 2021 IPO.
