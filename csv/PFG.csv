The company's current dividend payout sits at $0.56, equating to a dividend yield of 4.37% at current price levels. What Are Ex-Dividend Dates? An ex-dividend date is when a company's shares stop trading with its current dividend payout in preparation for the company to announce a new one. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Most ex-dividend dates operate on a quarterly basis. Principal Financial Group's Dividend Performance Over the past year, Principal Financial Group has seen its dividend payouts remain the same and its yields climb upward overall. Last year on February 28, 2020 the company's payout sat at $0.56, which has returned to its value today. Principal Financial Group's dividend yield last year was 4.23%, which has since grown by 0.14%. Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market. To read more news on Principal Financial Group click here.
