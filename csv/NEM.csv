Bulls were very much pressing their bets ahead of the holiday weekend. Sometimes their antics are on full display when you look at the S&P other times, you have to dig a bit deeper. In today’s article on breakout stocks to buy, I’ll highlight the areas that saw inflows this week and are catching my eye. Then, I’ll divulge three of my favorite stocks to trade. Semiconductors have been one of the growth engines for the tech sector over the past year. The growth fallout had them on the ropes, but they made a comeback this week that helped the Nasdaq return to an uptrend. Small-caps also woke up. The Russell 2000 Index outperformed the S&P 500 and is now sitting soundly on top of its 50-day moving average. Finally, momentum stocks are starting to rise from the ashes. 7 Best Stocks for Upcoming Grads to Buy and Hold Forever Together, these developments point to an improvement in market health and should give buyers the confidence to increase exposure. Here are three stocks to consider:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ:TTWO) Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) Let’s take a closer look at each setup. Breakout Stocks to Buy: Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Two weeks ago, I wouldn’t have touched TTWO. Its price chart was sinking, and better setups beckoned in Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA). But the response to its quarterly report changed everything. And, it leads the list of breakout stocks to buy. Price and volume surged, pushing TTWO from the lower end to the upper end of its three-month trading range in a single bound. Since then, we’ve carved out a clean high base formation. Day-by-day, we’re chewing through overhead supply while digesting the large gains. At the same time, overbought pressures are easing. Look for a break above $188.50 to signal the next up leg is beginning. Then, pull the trigger on bullish trades. With implied volatility in the tank following earnings, I like buying call verticals here. The Trade: Buy the August $190/$200 bull call spread for $3.00 You’re risking $3 to make $7. Snowflake (SNOW) Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Snowflake’s price chart has been decisively bearish all year long – until now. With this week’s strength, the once high-flying software company is now above its 50-day moving average. I didn’t find its earnings announcement all that interesting. But the market has spoken, and it’s a message I can’t ignore. Yesterday’s high-volume rally engulfed the prior five trading sessions. It also blasted through a resistance zone that was impenetrable for more than two months. This is actually the first breach of a ceiling we’ve seen since SNOW stock topped last December. I suspect many bears are running scared, given the change in character. 7 Best Stocks for Upcoming Grads to Buy and Hold Forever Since the trend reversal is still in its infancy, I prefer higher probability cash flow trades over shooting for the moon with an aggressive bet. If you think SNOW can stay above $200 for the next month, enter the following spread. The Trade: Sell the July $200/$195 bull put for 65 cents. You’re risking $4.35 to make 65 cents. However, the loss will be far less if you exit on a break of $200. Breakout Stocks to Buy: Newmont Mining (NEM) Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade The final entry in our breakout stocks is in an area that’s no stranger to strength this year – gold stocks. Inflation worries are carrying precious metals higher and gold miners have been big beneficiaries. After making a new 52-week high, NEM has been coiling quietly in a narrow range. Volume remains subdued. This signals we’re seeing garden variety profit-taking and not some mass exodus. The pause is allowing the 20-day moving average to play catch-up and overbought pressures to ease. Now is the time to prep trades for the next breakout. I like using $75 as the trigger point. The Trade: Buy the August $75/$80 bull call vertical for around $1.40. The spread cost will be slightly higher if you wait for NEM to take out resistance first.

The structural and geological framework of the Betty and Hayes property located immediately to the east is characterized by 4 major fault arrays: 1) WNW-trending Yukon River Shear Zone (YRSZ); 2) E-W trending Coffee Creek fault; 3) NW-trending Big Creek fault; and 4) NE-trending Dip Creek fault. The Coffee Creek and Big Creek fault systems are highly prospective structures that, respectfully, control orogenic gold at Newmont's Coffee Gold deposit and porphyry and epithermal gold mineralization at Triumph Gold Corp.’s (TSX.V: TIG) Nucleus and Revenue deposits to the southeast. Furthermore, the YRSZ constitutes a major crustal break within the Yukon-Tanana terrane, while the Dip Creek fault develops southeast of the Casino Cu-Au-Mo porphyry deposit transecting the Dawson Range in a NE-orientation. A new detailed structural interpretation of the Betty – Hayes properties is currently ongoing and is expected to significantly enhance the understanding of property- and target-scale structural controls on mineralization. 2020 Exploration Program The 2020 Betty exploration program included ground magnetics and VLF-EM surveys totaling 343 line kilometres on two separate grids, and infill soil geochemistry sampling on six separate grids at 25m spacings on 100m spaced survey lines (Figure 2 & 3). At total of 2,030 infill soil samples were collected where previous soil sampling had been at 50m sample spacings on 100m spaced survey lines. The areas infilled covered areas ranging from 400m x 600m to 3100m (east-west) x 2400m (north – south). A summary of the soil sampling results on the Betty property is provided below, as well as brief descriptions of the Betty Ford, Betty White and Mascot targets. Betty Ford Target The Betty Ford zone occurs approximately 700m to the south of the Betty White target and is associated with an east-west trending 300m x 200m gold in soil anomaly along a steep north facing slope. Work to date indicates the anomaly, which has gold in soil values of up to 461 ppb, is associated with fractured, quartz-sericite-pyrite altered, micaceous quartzite. RAB drilling in 2018 intersected near-surface mineralization grading 0.94 g/t Au over 24.39m in hole BETFRDRAB-001, and 1.08 g/t Au over 50.29m in hole BETFRDRAB-002. A second area of anomalous soil geochemistry at Betty Ford, which remains to be drill tested, lies 250m to the ENE and exhibits lower gold values but strong lead and silver values (up to 853 ppm Pb and 28 ppm Ag). Betty White Target The Betty White target consists of a > 800m long, NE trending Au, As, and Sb soil anomaly across a north facing hillside above Sunshine Creek. The zone is currently interpreted as a NE trending fault/shear zone and gold mineralization at surface has been partially outlined over 400m of the trend from GT Probe sampling, and limited rotary air blast (RAB) drilling. The mineralization is hosted within a E-NE striking, gently south dipping (~20°) package of biotite schist-gneiss, quartzite, minor hornblende gneiss, and cross-cutting, mafic feldspar porphyry dikes, and is associated with a 125m wide zone of strong sericite +/- carbonate alteration containing disseminated to fracture-controlled pyrite and arsenopyrite. The strongest gold mineralization occurs over a 25m wide interval within the broader alteration halo and is associated with strong silicification, increased sulphide content, increased folding and crenulation of the rock units, and mm-scale quartz veinlets and brecciation. Results from 2018 RAB drilling by the Company include 0.47 g/t Au over 22.86m in hole BETWHTRAB-019 and 1.80 g/t Au over 4.57m in hole BETWHTRAB-021. Mascot Target The Mascot target area is located in the southern portion of the property and is hosted within Dawson Range intrusive rocks. Several sub-zones including the Page, Boop, Rubble and Davis zones have been defined through soil geochemistry over a 3km trend, with two distinct multi-element suites. The Davis zone is defined by Au-As-Ag-Pb-Zn +/- Sb, while the Rubble and Page are defined by Au-As-Bi-Sb. The Boop appears to have an overlap between these two signatures. The mineralization appears to be related to narrow (<5m) fault/fracture zones with narrow selvages of quartz-sericite-carbonate alteration within the granodiorite. Mineralization typically consists of disseminated to massive sulphides (pyrite > arsenopyrite ± sphalerite ± galena ± chalcopyrite) along cm-scale veinlets with the strongest mineralization associated with silicification. The Mascot area saw significant reverse circulation (RC) drilling in 2012 by Ethos Gold Corp. Significant results (Figure 4) included 1.48 g/t Au over 21.30m in hole BETR12-007 at the Davis zone, 29.75 g/t Au over 3.10m in hole BETR12-012 at the Boop zone, and 2.62 g/t Au over 41.10m in hole BETR12-022 at the Page zone (1).

Exploration Plans for 2021 Planned exploration work for 2021 consists of first-ever diamond drilling on several targets on the Betty property, as well as a new detailed structural interpretation. Additional details on the program will be provided in the coming weeks.

Upon completion of the Arrangement, GT Gold became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Newmont. “Newmont is excited to have the Tatogga project in the highly-sought after Golden Triangle district of British Columbia, Canada, become part of our world-class portfolio and part of our future,” said Newmont President and CEO Tom Palmer. “We look forward to continuing to build a respectful and meaningful relationship with the Tahltan Nation, including the community of Iskut. The relationships we have with Indigenous communities, First Nations and host communities are critical to the way we operate, and we look forward to partnering with the Tahltan Nation at all levels, and with the Government of British Columbia to ensure a shared path forward as we understand that Tahltan consent is necessary for advancing the project.” Ashwath Mehra, Executive Chair of GT Gold stated, “We are delighted to close this Transaction with Newmont today, representing the execution of our plan and the culmination of significant value creation for GT Gold shareholders since the formation of the Company just a few years ago. As we pass custody of this world-class property to Newmont, we are sure it is in the best hands. I would like to thank the whole team of employees, consultants, advisors and directors, who over the years have helped create GT Gold and made it what is today.” The Arrangement was approved by GT Gold’s shareholders at a special meeting held on May 6, 2021, and by the Supreme Court of British Columbia on May 10, 2021. Under the terms of the Arrangement, shareholders of GT Gold (other than Newmont and its affiliates), will receive C$3.25 per GT Gold common share in cash. The Company expects that its common shares will be delisted from the TSX Venture Exchange on or about May 21, 2021, and the Company intends to promptly apply to cease to be a reporting issuer in Alberta and British Columbia. Newmont trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: NEM) and on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: NGT).

Newmont’s revenue came in at $2.87 billion for the quarter ended March 31, an increase of 11% from $2.58 billion in the prior-year quarter. The rise is mainly due to higher average realized prices for metals, partially offset by lower sales volumes. Revenue missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.86%. Meanwhile, adjusted net income was $594 million or $0.74 per share in 1Q 2021, an improvement from $326 million or $0.40 per diluted share in 1Q 2020. However, it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.75 per share. The average realized price of gold jumped 10% to $1,751 per ounce in the quarter. Production fell 1.4% to 1.46 million ounces due to the sale of its Red Lake mine and Covid-related disruptions at its Cerro Negro mine. Newmont President and CEO Tom Palmer said, ""In the first quarter we delivered a solid financial performance with $1.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $442 million in free cash flow, putting Newmont on track to achieve our full-year guidance with improving production expected in the second half of the year. We remain confident in the strength of our business as we invest in our world-class portfolio, strengthening the balance sheet and sustaining our quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share."" (See Newmont Mining stock analysis on TipRanks.) Two days ago, J.P. Morgan analyst Michael Glick maintained a Buy rating on the stock but lowered its price target to $75.00 (C$92.21) for a 20.7% upside potential. Glick said in a research note that gold stocks have come under pressure from rising real yields and falling gold prices since the start of the year. Overall, the consensus on the Street is that NGT is a Strong Buy based on 7 Buys and 2 Holds. The average analyst price target of C$87.99 implies an upside potential of about 15% from current levels.

Chief Executive Officer Tom Palmer.Futures hit $10,000 a metric ton on Thursday for the first time since 2011 as mines struggle to keep up with surging demand. Newmont, the world’s largest gold producer, is increasing exposure to copper through several “mega projects,” Palmer said on an earnings call. Even if just one materializes, copper will account for 15-20% of the company’s total output by the end of the decade, he said.“I’m pretty excited about having good exposure to copper at that time when the world is going through the energy transition,” Palmer said on an interview with Bloomberg TV following the earnings call. “Copper’s got a pretty good story in front of it. I think its day in the sun is more towards the end of this decade.”The copper push doesn’t mean Palmer has a downbeat view on gold. He sees bullion prices holding their current “very healthy levels” or even moving higher given fiscal and monetary stimulus. India should remain one of the key sources of demand after the country recovers from the Covid-19 tragedy, Palmer said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=16d59231e2d6669e42148104f9006e4a9311f2e2899e529a8f500d2a78815319
