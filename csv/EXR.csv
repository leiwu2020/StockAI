Extra Space Storage (EXR) posted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.19 during the fourth quarter, as compared with $0.86 in the year ago period. The company’s core funds from operations (FFO) per share increased 16.5% year-on-year to $1.48. Revenue rose about 5.3% year-on-year to $353.5 million topping analysts’ estimates of $292.8 million. The sales increase was attributable to 2.3% growth in same-store revenue, the occupancy rate rose to 94.8% as compared to 92.4% in the comparable year-ago period. For fiscal 2020, the company generated sales of $1.36 billion, up from the $1.31 billion posted in 2019. Diluted earnings per share came in at $3.71 versus $3.24 in the comparable year-ago period.
