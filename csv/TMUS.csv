This milestone is expected to filter out calls from scammers and spammers.



The industry-first call was successfully made on T Mobile’s voice network using First Orion’s technology. Moreover, interfaces of Everbridge, NetNumber, Numeracle, and Twilio were leveraged to complete the call.



RCD integrated calls show a brand’s logo or any recognizable information on the display, so that one can verify that the call is coming from a genuine source, before taking the call. Alarmingly, U.S. consumers collectively receive billions of spam calls, resulting in 80% of Americans saying that they generally refrain from answering calls from unknown numbers. This behavior also leads to them missing important or emergency calls that come from unknown numbers. This makes RCD integrated calling an important step to address this issue. (See T Mobile stock chart on TipRanks)



Abdul Saad, CTO of T Mobile, said, “The ability to deliver RCD to mobile devices is a key tool in the battle against scammers as it increases consumer trust in knowing who is calling them and why."" He added, “This proof-of-concept shows that by working together as an industry we can make sure that legal, critical, and wanted calls are delivered with a high level of consumer confidence.”



Information on a traditional Caller ID is pulled from third-party databases. On the other hand, in RCD, which is part of the STIR/SHAKEN framework, information is delivered directly from the source, and unauthenticated information cannot be displayed.



Recently, Societe Generale analyst Ottavio Adorisio reiterated a Buy rating on the stock, while raising the price target to $170 from $130, implying a 13.8% upside potential to current levels.



Adorisio expects T Mobile’s growth momentum to continue, encouraged by the company’s “two key growth drivers: strong pricing power and the ability to tap significant scale synergies to boost margins.""



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 10 Buys and 3 Holds. The average T Mobile price target of $158.38 implies 6% upside potential to current levels.



Additionally, News Sentiment for T Mobile is Very Positive, based on 16 articles over the past seven days. All the articles have Bullish sentiment, compared to a sector average of 67%, and none have Bearish Sentiment, compared to a sector average of 33%.

While penny stocks (stocks that trade for less than $5 a share) have the potential for big gains, they can also be extremely volatile and are prone to big swings and even bigger losses. Investors willing to put money into penny stocks need to have strong convictions and strong stomachs. That said, there are some penny stocks that are more stable than others and could appeal to conservative investors. These tend to be shares of once high-flying companies that have fallen on hard times or are in turnaround mode, as well as shares of companies with good products that are in startup mode. These stocks tend to standout from the copper crowd with strong financials and potential for long-term gains. 7 Best Stocks for Upcoming Grads to Buy and Hold Forever In this article, we look at four penny stocks that even conservative investors could love.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Ideanomics (NASDAQ:IDEX) Nokia (NYSE:NOK) Chico’s FAS (NYSE:CHS) Electrameccanica Vehicles (NASDAQ:SOLO) Penny Stocks for Conservative Investors: Ideanomics (IDEX) Source: Sopotnicki / Shutterstock.com At $3 a share, IDEX stock is trading today at roughly half its 52-week high of $5.53 a share. Still, the share price of the fintech and electric vehicle (EV) company that is headquartered in New York City and has offices throughout China is up 710% from its 52-week low of $0.37. With returns like that, any investor could learn to love Ideanomics. Founded in 2004 as China Broadband, the company has gone through several names and re-brands over the years. However, the company and its stock look like they are finding their footing and gaining traction. The current optimism has come after Ideanomics reported better first-quarter results than analysts had expected. The company reported earnings per share of $0.00, better by 3 cents than what analysts had anticipated. Revenue in the first quarter came in at $32.71 million, which beat the forecast by $7.71 million. Ideanomics also impressed by announcing that it had $356 million of cash on hand at the end of the quarter, giving the company plenty of capital for future investments and expansion. While some analysts continue to question Ideanomics’ role in the electric vehicle space, its fintech business continues to perform strongly, especially in China. Nokia (NOK) Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com At $5.07 a share, NOK stock is just starting to edge out of penny stock territory. It’s been a long road for the Finnish telecommunications giant that was the world’s leading manufacturer of flip cell phones back in the late 1990s and early 2000s. But it looks like the company has finally found a new niche for itself as a developer of fifth generation (5G) wireless internet networks. Companies such as as T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) are turning to Nokia to help them get their 5G networks up and running. Also noteworthy is the fact that Nokia is the largest 5G network provider in China with a 25% market share in that country. Analysts expect that 5G wireless, which is 100 times faster than today’s 4G networks, will become the internet standard throughout the world in coming years, and Nokia is positioned to capitalize. 7 Cheap Stocks With Dividends for Both Returns and Cash Flow NOK stock is up 34% year-to-date at its current price. And 24% of that move higher has come since the end of April. Chico’s FAS (CHS) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstockc.om Fort Myers, Florida-based Chico’s FAS is a leading operator of women’s clothing brands. This includes its namesake Chico’s retail stores, as well as Soma, TellTale and other brands. Despite Covid-19 shuttering many of Chico’s brick-and-mortar stores, the company managed to pivot to its e-commerce platform and stay afloat through online sales. Digital sales at Chico’s FAS rose almost 70% in its most recent quarter, and the company has announced plans to shift more of its business online and to e-commerce platforms. Chico’s FAS latest quarterly results showed the company had a quarterly net loss of $79 million or $0.68 per share. This was due to depressed sales at the company’s 1,300 physical store locations as Covid-19 lockdown measures continued to hurt overall sales. Chico’s FAS has announced plans to permanently close 16% of its remaining stores within the next three years as it shifts operations online. The store closures are expected to be an important cost-saving measure for the company. CHS stock recently hit a 52-week high of $4.92 a share on May 18 and is currently trading at $4.46. The share price is up 181% year-to-date. Electrameccanica Vehicles (SOLO) Source: Luis War / Shutterstock.com Another electric vehicle stock that may appeal to cautious investors is Vancouver, British Columbia-based Electrameccanica Vehicles. The company manufactures a unique, single-passenger, three-wheeled electric vehicle called the “SOLO” that some analysts refer to as a “tryke.” The company has selected Mesa, Arizona, as the location for its U.S. manufacturing base and has opened showrooms for its vehicles in several locations, including San Diego, California. The Arizona facility will house light vehicle assembly and an engineering center. It’s still early days at Electrameccanica Vehicles, and the company is still firmly in startup mode. In its most recent quarter, Electrameccanica Vehicles reported revenue of only $224,000 and a net loss of $41.1 million, much of which can be attributed to expanding operations and business spending. However, the company has cash on hand of $129.5 million, which puts it on a solid financial footing. 8 Best Utility Stocks to Buy for Downside Protection SOLO stock is down 37% year-to-date at $3.90 a share and has been trading sideways since early May. Strong sales would help the stock reverse and move higher.

Nokia will secure T-Mobile’s network against cyber threats and also help accelerate the telecom operator’s digital transformation. T-Mobile Netherlands is the Dutch sister company of T-Mobile US (TMUS). Both are controlled by Germany’s Deutsche Telekom. Finland-based Nokia sells telecom network equipment and provides the software and services that go with them. Regulators have demanded that operators improve the security of their networks at a time when threats and attacks are rising globally. Nokia will apply its NetGuard Audit Compliance Manager to minimize security risks to T-Mobile’s network and also help the operator improve its regulatory compliance. In addition to securing the network, Nokia will upgrade T-Mobile’s optical network. The upgrade will enable the network to meet 5G demands and make it ready for future technological developments. Furthermore, the work is expected to increase the network’s cost efficiency. Nokia will use its WaveFabric service-ready platforms and WaveSuite software for the optical network renewal. “Our intensified partnership with T-Mobile Netherlands leverages our deep understanding of their network while also ensuring heightened importance on protecting their network against possible cyber breaches,” commented Nokia’s Friedrich Trawoeger. Nokia’s security and optical network upgrade contract with T-Mobile Netherlands will run for five years. In another business win, Nokia will provide equipment and other services to AirFiber to help the broadband provider expand its fiber network in Bangalore and Tamil Nadu, India. (See Nokia stock analysis on TipRanks) Charter Equity analyst Edward Snyder recently reiterated a Buy rating on Nokia stock without assigning it a price target. The analyst believes Nokia stands to benefit from the Sweden-China tensions. Sweden banned Chinese vendors from its 5G market with China likely to retaliate. Nokia’s Sweden-based competitor Ericsson (ERIC) now fears it could lose market share in China. “Nokia to benefit if China excludes Ericsson from upcoming 5G tenders,” noted Snyder. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 5 Buy and 3 Hold ratings. The average analyst price target of $5.65 implies 11.44% upside potential to the current price. NOK scores a 6 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, suggesting the stock’s returns will likely align with the market performance.

company,1620704171,Dish Network Taps Debt Market To Raise $1.25B For Broadcast Unit,67742858,https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?305035393,TMUS,Nasdaq,"DISH Network (DISH) plans to raise $1.25 billion in a debt offering through its broadcast division DISH DBS Corporation. Dish primarily operates a satellite pay-TV service, but also entered the wireless business last year, when it acquired Boost Mobile. In a recent winning move, Amazon (AMZN) chose Dish to provide infrastructure for its cloud-based 5G network. The debt offering will be subject to market conditions and will involve the sale of senior notes. Dish will sell the notes only to qualified institutional investors, the company said in a press release. More details on Dish’s debt offering plan are expected as the company hasn’t yet revealed the notes’ maturities.Dish’s broadcast subsidiary intends to use the money from the debt offering to fund general corporate needs, including repayment of some of its existing debts.The tapping of the debt market now comes at a time when borrowing is cheap because of low interest rates. Companies can borrow cheaply now to replace expensive debts taken earlier.Notably, the debt offering plan follows a strong first-quarter performance. Profit and revenue jumped from a year ago despite Dish's loss of pay-TV and wireless subscribers. The company reported revenue totaling $4.50 billion for the quarter ending March 31, 2021, compared to $3.22 billion for the corresponding period in 2020. (See Dish Network stock analysis on TipRanks)On the back of Dish’s strong Q1 earnings results, Pivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak reiterated a Hold rating but lifted the price target on the stock to $50 from $34. Wlodarczak’s new price target indicates 7.62% upside potential to the current price. The analyst noted that discussions by Dish management about the company’s wireless efforts are encouraging, supporting the price upgrade. However, he maintained the Hold rating is preserved due to two factors. For one, the stock has already had a substantial run. Additionally, launches of new products are likely to be hit by delays.Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 3 Buy, 4 Hold, and 1 Sell ratings. The average analyst price target of $46.88 implies 0.90% upside potential to current levels.DISH scores a 9 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating the stock is likely to outperform the market.Related News:CGI Wins Public Sector Tender Worth C$576M In FinlandLeidos Completes Acquisition Of Gibbs & Cox Acquisition; Ups Guidance For FY21GoPro Transition Pays Off Delivers Revenue And Profit Growth in 1Q",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=8ed0f71cb550df9e5c7e56172fe2593eefe12447e33e63998e1d852724b3af47
