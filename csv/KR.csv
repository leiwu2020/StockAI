(KR) reported stronger-than-expected Q1 results, topping both earnings and revenue estimates, driven by accelerating growth in digital sales. Shares of the American retailer gained 4.3% on Thursday at the close.



The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.19 per share, beating analysts’ expectations of $1.01 per share. Revenues of $41.3 billion also exceeded the consensus estimate of $39.78 billion.



Meanwhile, revenues declined 0.5% on a year-over-year basis. The company reported earnings of $1.22 per share in the prior-year period.



Digital sales grew 16% year-over-year, whereas it grew 108% on a 2-year stack basis. However, identical sales, ex-fuel, declined 4.1% year-over-year but increased 14.9% on a 2-year stack basis. (See KR stock chart on TipRanks)



Following the Q1 results, the company raised its guidance for full-year 2021. The company now forecasts adjusted earnings in the range of $2.95 to $3.10 per share, while the consensus estimate is pegged at $2.85 per share. The 2-year identical sales stack is projected to grow between 10.1% and 11.6%.



The Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization worth $1 billion in line with the company’s commitment to delivering strong shareholder returns of 8-11%. The prior authorization expired last week.



Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen commented, “Kroger's strong execution delivered identical sales results in the first quarter that exceeded our original expectations. Customers are responding to the investments we have made in digital, as evidenced by our triple-digit growth in digital sales since the beginning of 2019. We were disciplined in driving costs out of the business and we achieved record growth in Kroger's alternative profit business, demonstrating the power and attractiveness of our long-term model.”



Following the robust Q1 results, Wells Fargo analyst Edward Kelly reiterated a Hold rating on the stock.



Kelly believes that Kroger’s risk/reward is balanced at current levels, and the updated guidance should reduce investors’ rising concerns regarding COVID-related share loss and inflation pass-through.

The weekly unemployment claims report and the Philadelphia Fed business outlook report for June will be released today.



S&P, Dow, and Nasdaq futures were in red at the time of writing, with 0.3%, 0.2%, and 0.4% lower trading, respectively.



Commercial Metals Company (CMC), Jabil Circuit (JBL), and Kroger Company (KR) are expected to report earnings before the market opens, while Dynagas LNG Partners LP (DLNG), Adobe (ADBE), and Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc. (SWBI) are expected to report after the market close.



Midatech Pharma Plc (MTP) was the most actively traded stock in pre-market trading. Recently, the R&D biotechnology company, which is focused on improving the bio-delivery and biodistribution of medicines, disclosed breakthrough in vitro data. The data reflects Q-Sphera’s capability in the formulation of proteins into long-acting injectable products, along with progress across multiple other programs. Per the company, these results offer opportunities for its Q-Sphera technology.



KULR Technology Group Inc (KULR) was the biggest gainer in pre-market trading as the stock jumped 65.2% at the time of writing. Recently, the developer of next-generation lithium-ion battery safety and thermal management technologies revealed that it has been granted special permission by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DoT) to transport the prototype lithium cells and batteries aboard cargo aircrafts.



The special permit authorizes the manufacture, mark, sale, and use of KULR's specially designed packaging for the transportation of prototype lithium cells and batteries. It also permits them to transport prototype lithium cells and batteries contained in or packed with equipment, the company said.



KULR’s President and COO Keith Cochran said, “KULR's packaging was approved by the US DoT based on its ability to contain potential hazards in the unlikely event that a cell or battery would experience a thermal event. KULR's newly issued special permit allows customers to safely ship prototype batteries that are necessary to advance innovation and contribute to the development of alternative green energy sources.”



CureVac (CVAC) was the biggest laggard in pre-market trading, as the stock plunged 45.8% at the time of writing. Recently, the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company disclosed results of its second interim analysis of its international pivotal Phase 2b/3 study in about 40,000 subjects (the HERALD study) of CureVac's first-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidate, CVnCoV. At the interim analysis, CVnCoV reflected only 47% interim vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 disease of any severity, and failed to meet pre-specified statistical success criteria.



CureVac CEO Dr. Franz-Werner Haas said, “While we were hoping for a stronger interim outcome, we recognize that demonstrating high efficacy in this unprecedented broad diversity of variants is challenging. As we are continuing toward the final analysis with a minimum of 80 additional cases, the overall vaccine efficacy may change. In addition, the variant-rich environment underlines the importance of developing next-generation vaccines as new virus variants continue to emerge.”



In earnings news, Lennar Corporation (LEN), the home construction company, reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter (ended May 31) results. Net earnings of $2.95 per share surpassed analysts’ expectations of $2.36 per share. It also compares favorably with the net earnings of $1.65 recorded in the same quarter last year.



Revenues came in at $6.4 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $5.88 billion and surged 22% from the year-ago period.  Notably, the company witnessed new orders of 17,157 homes during the quarter, a 32% increase. New home deliveries of 14,493 homes were up 14% year-over-year.



Lennar’s co-CEO Jon Jaffe commented, “We continue to focus on production costs and cycle times as the homebuilding industry ramps up to meet growing demand. Lennar is uniquely positioned with our size, scale and production oriented Everything’s Included business model to mitigate the well documented industry supply challenges.”



In M&A news, Elanco Animal Health (ELAN) will snap up Kindred Biosciences (KIN), a biopharmaceutical company, for $9.25 per share, which represents an approximate value of $440 million. This price signifies a premium of 52% based on the 30-day average.



Through this acquisition, Elanco’s expansion plans will speed up its lucrative pet health space, especially in the burgeoning billion-dollar dermatology category. The deal is likely to add an incremental $100 million to the previous innovation revenue guidance range of $500 million to $600 million by 2025, while also offering attractive opportunities thereafter. The acquisition is expected to close during the third quarter of 2021, subject to certain regulatory approvals.



Elanco CEO Jeff Simmons said, “This highly complementary combination is focused in one of the most exciting spaces in pet health, and one where we see a strategic imperative to build a differentiated competitive offering.”



Meanwhile, Viavi Solutions (VIAV) proposes to snap up all outstanding subordinate voting shares and multiple voting shares of EXFO Inc for a total value of $430 million. The transaction values the company at $7.50 a share, representing a 103% premium to the June 4 closing price. The price tag also represents a 25% premium to the $6 consideration offered under the “Going Private Transaction.""



If the merger is consummated, the combined company is likely to be a leader in communications, tests, and measurement over the next decade. Furthermore, the combined entity will be able to invest in opportunistic growth areas while achieving greater operating leverage. However, the proposed merger faces opposition from EXFO’s majority shareholder, Germain Lamonde, who insists not considering any alternative change of control transaction.



Extended Stay America (STAY), along with its paired-share REIT, ESH Hospitality, Inc., has closed the deal under which they have been acquired by funds managed by Blackstone Real Estate Partners (Blackstone) and Starwood Capital Group. They were acquired for $20.50 per paired share in a cash deal worth $6 billion. In March, an agreement was signed by STAY to be taken private in a 50/50 joint venture between Blackstone Real Estate Partners and private investment firm Starwood Capital Group.



In other news, one of the biggest car manufacturers and a global leader in battery and fuel cell technology, General Motors Co., (GM) disclosed an increase in its Electric Vehicle (EV) and Autonomous Vehicle (AV) spending by 75% to $35 billion through 2025.



General Motors CEO Mary Barra commented, “GM is targeting annual global EV sales of more than 1 million by 2025, and we are increasing our investment to scale faster because we see momentum building in the United States for electrification, along with customer demand for our product portfolio.”",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a68c47e5aca405251e7c7183cdf5f3c656970e63cfb3a099e662c764f2fd3eba

That Might Not Last,67838485,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VdZB9VMLVrVjHJEvGxWA9g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTIwMDA7aD0xMzM0/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uZCcN.CtaUS3t_5rCnU8mA--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/29001640816547616940e8e9985fba1c,KR,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- When the pandemic hit the Brookdale Chambrel senior living community in Williamsburg, Virginia, Nancy Crowell knew hopping in the car and heading to the local Harris Teeter supermarket was now out of the question. The virus was spreading fast, and Brookdale’s residents were being encouraged to stay put. Staff set up computers in the main common room and began teaching residents how to open online accounts to order groceries.Crowell’s first attempt to order from Kroger Co.’s Harris Teeter chain failed, so the 85-year-old retiree switched to another local grocer’s website only to discover an annoyance familiar to legions of online grocery shoppers: substitutions of her favorite brands and products. “Once, I ordered a few ounces of bouillon and got a great big quart bottle,” she said. “It’s still in my closet.”Crowell tried Harris Teeter again and succeeded, ordering seven times between May and August. But when the holidays rolled around last year, Crowell was once again walking the aisles. “There’s just something about picking up your own stalk of celery,” she said. The Covid-19 outbreak super-charged online grocery shopping, prompting industry watchers to declare that the habits of millions had forever changed. In fact, it’s a little more complicated than that. Yes, Walmart Inc., Kroger and other chains picked up millions of new online customers—generating additional revenue and persuading even skeptical executives to expand their digital operations. But holding onto these shoppers is hardly a foregone conclusion—especially older ones like Crowell, who are already reverting to pre-pandemic behavior. That’s bad news for web grocery specialists like Instacart Inc., which processes orders and deliveries for thousands of supermarkets and has helped almost 300,000 senior customers figure out how to use its service. It’s also not great for brick-and-mortar food retailers because shoppers spend considerably more when they buy groceries online than when they have to lug everything home themselves. And there are more seniors online than you’d think: More than three in 10 people age 60 or older shopped for groceries online in April, according to consultants Brick Meets Click and Mercatus, and the number of seniors using Instacart last year rose faster than any other age group.Almost half of Baby Boomers surveyed by Morgan Stanley said they’ll continue to grocery shop online at the same rate they did during the outbreak. Those seniors who stay online will do so because e-commerce has “become ritualized as a part of everyday life,” says Columbia Business School lecturer Robert Morais. It’s what anthropologists like Morais call an “adaptive strategy,” not unlike when humans went from foraging for food to agriculture and then onto large-scale manufacturing.But the number of seniors using web grocery regularly declined by 25% in April compared with the previous year, Brick Meets Click and Mercatus found, the biggest drop of any age group by far. That suggests many seniors are still hunter-gatherers at heart, Morais says, and often prefer to use their senses to choose the food that’s most appealing, like Crowell’s celery. Jody Holtzman, an expert on the so-called longevity economy and the former head of market innovation at the AARP, says seniors will probably split their shopping going forward, using the web periodically to stock up on staples like canned goods and cereal and reserving in-store trips for produce, fish and meat.There’s also the social aspect of shopping and interacting with staff and neighbors, something that’s particularly appealing for older Americans who were unable to see friends and family during lockdowns. Vivian Paquette, 85, another resident of the Brookdale community who started online shopping last year but has since given it up, says she enjoys chatting with the cashiers at the local Harris Teeter.“I feel I have a connection to the store,” she says. “This might be the only person I talk to today!”Grocers are responding to the defections by offering more enticements to stay online. Kroger doled out half a trillion personalized product recommendations to its digital customers last year. Albertsons, which operates 2,277 supermarkets under banners like Safeway and Vons, is doing online cooking demonstrations. Instacart created a “Senior Support Service” last fall to help older customers get accustomed to ordering online and says it’s growing by about 1,000 users a day this year. Other chains will waive delivery fees if shoppers come back online or offer discounts. “As the necessity imposed by the pandemic lessens,” Holtzman says, “retailers will have to start to play the price game.”Still, all those sweeteners won’t convince Paquette to hop online again. What would? “I don’t know,” she says. “Maybe a free lobster dinner?” For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=41a53a1b7469eee2335b3f7617b1c539757fa647f33ba919c377606e0d962050

The past week's bullish calls included a couple of FAANG stocks and a company that just took a big hit. The iPhone maker, a COVID-19 vaccine play and a cryptocurrency-related stock were among the bearish calls seen during the week. May has arrived, and investors are having to decide whether to ""sell and go away,"" given the backdrop of a stronger-than-expected earnings season, improving economic data, a strong vaccine rollout in the United States, government stimulus and easy monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. Yet, stocks have been basically treading water for the past two weeks, which may suggest that all the good news is priced in. This comes amid the chip shortage, the struggling tech sector and Fed Chair Yellen's hinting at future rate hikes. To cap it all off, high expectations for employment were dashed by a weak jobs report. That may soothe worries over the economy overheating and how the Fed might respond, though. In other news last week, the White House gave the pharmaceutical industry a scare, a leading social media platform made a contentious decision, and a billionaire philanthropist is about to go solo. The Dow Jones industrials ended May's first trading week about 2.6% higher, while the S&P 500 saw a smaller gain, and the Nasdaq lagged with a retreat of about 1.5%. Through it all, Benzinga continued to examine the prospects for many of the stocks most popular with investors. Here are a few of this past week's most bullish and bearish posts that are worth another look. The Bulls In Adam Eckert's ""Why Amazon Stock Has A Lot Of Room To Go Higher,"" check out why a market strategist told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" that Amazon.com, Inc.
