Robinson Worldwide (NASDAQ:CHRW) announced shareholders can expect to receive a dividend payable on April 1, 2021. The stock will then go ex-dividend 1 business day(s) before the record date. The ex-dividend date for C.H. Robinson Worldwide is set for March 4, 2021. The company's current dividend payout sits at $0.51, equating to a dividend yield of 2.35% at current price levels. The Significance Of Ex-Dividend Dates An ex-dividend date is when a company's shares stop trading with its current dividend payout in preparation for the company to announce a new one. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Typically, companies will announce and implement new dividend yields on a quarterly basis. Understanding C.H. Robinson Worldwide's Dividend Payouts And Yields Over the past year, C.H. Robinson Worldwide has seen its dividend payouts remain the same and its yields trend downward. Last year on March 5, 2020 the company's payout sat at $0.51, which has returned to its value today. C.H. Robinson Worldwide's dividend yield last year was 2.8%, which has since decreased by 0.45%. Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market. To read more news on C.H. Robinson Worldwide click here.
