Although not yet the case, the situation is heating up between PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) and Shopify Inc. (SHOP), after Shopify launched its one-button payment option for merchants selling on both Google (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB). This was the first time Shopify provided extra services to merchants not explicitly using its platform. (See PayPal stock charts on TipRanks)  



Trevor Williams of Jefferies Group reported that while this development does not immediately put the two companies at odds, it does raise red flags for those looking into PayPal’s future. He described PayPal and Shopify’s relationship as “frenemies,” providing more benefit to one another than problems. Paypal is a default checkout option on Shopify, and Williams estimates that around 3% of Paypal's value comes from Shopify. 



Williams assigned a Buy rating on PYPL and declared a price target of $350. This price target was raised on positive outlook for PayPal from his previous $340, and now represents a possible 12-month upside of 18.79%.  



The analyst detailed that Shopify’s new Shop Pay consumer checkout experience does not yet provide the ability to use payment installments, but that it could be seen more of a direct competitor to PayPal if this were to be added.  



Stating that there is “limited risk” of Shopify removing PayPal as a checkout option, Williams asserted that the move would be “highly disruptive” to Shopify’s sellers, as a significant percentage of sales are made with the convenient service. Furthermore, he does not expect PayPal to lose short-term market share from the ambitious shift in direction from Shopify.  



Shopify currently comes with PayPal Express as a built-in option for merchants, and also allows Google Pay and Apple Pay to be used by consumers. The possibility that the ecommerce platform is attempting to monopolize its checkout experience does not concern Williams, as its competitors currently process large portions of Shopify's merchant’s sales.



On TipRanks, PYPL has an analyst rating consensus of Strong Buy, based on 22 Buy and 3 Sell ratings. The average PayPal price target is $325.88, reflecting a possible 12-month upside of 10.61%. The branded checkout service company closed Friday trading at a price of $294.63.

Question: ""Where does an 800-lb. piece of fruit sit down?""



Answer: ""Anywhere it wants to.""



On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that 800-lb. corporate titan Apple (APPL) wants to get in on the ""buy now, pay later"" (BNPL) game -- a credit card-like product that allows customers to pay in installments for purchases made at certain retailers -- that was popularized by companies like PayPal (PYPL) and Affirm (AFRM). $350 billion financial juggernaut PayPal weathered the news quite well, losing less than 1% on Tuesday, but Affirm wasn't so lucky, and its shares fell 10.5%.



But... are Affirm investors right to be frightened of Apple? Let's take a look at the details of Apple's plan, and find out. 



According to Bloomberg, the ""Apple Pay Later"" service -- which has not yet launched -- will allow iPhone owners to purchase products through the company's Apple Pay service, with Goldman Sachs fronting the funds for the purchase. Later, the customer can pay back the loan to Goldman in one of two ways:



Either pay it back in four equal installments over the course of the next eight weeks, interest free (an option dubbed ""Apple Pay in 4""); orPay it back over a longer period of time (""months,"" says Bloomberg), with interest (an option termed ""Apple Pay Monthly Installments"").



Either way, Apple will continue to get a cut of the purchase price (thus functioning as a credit card). Customers will not, however, need to possess an Apple Card credit card (which is also issued by Goldman Sachs) to use Apple Pay Later. Apple Pay Later will be usable both for online transactions and at bricks and mortar stores. And in that regard, Bloomberg notes that ""85% of all U.S. retailers"" accept Apple Pay at their checkouts.



Now, so far this sounds like a service that could pose a threat to Affirm's BNPL service. And yet, commenting on the news Tuesday, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev argued that ""the knee-jerk reaction that has AFRM's stock down -10% is largely overblown."" Although Apple Pay, per se, may be accepted at 85% of retailers, ""signing up individual merchants"" to accept Apple Pay Later ""is easier said than done,"" observes Dolev. It may be especially difficult, moreover, for Apple to displace Affirm from its retailer relationships given that ""AFRM and other BNPL operators [already] have specific deals [in place] with merchants.""



At the same time, Dolev believes that Apple's desire to enter this business could be a positive for Affirm because it actually helps to confirm ""the attractiveness of the [BNPL] category,"" and that Affirm is onto something with its business model.



And in that regard, the 5-star analyst reminds investors that e-commerce in the U.S. is an $800 billion-a- year business. In his estimation, if Affirm can capture just $2.6 billion of that business by 2025 (growing from $762 million in revenue over the last 12 months), it will justify a $90 price target -- and a ""buy"" rating for Affirm stock. (To watch Dolev's track record, click here)



As for the rest of the Street, the bulls have it. AFRM's Moderate Buy consensus rating breaks down into 8 Buys, 4 Holds and 1 Sell received in the last three months. The 12-month average price target stands at $74.69, marking ~27% upside from where the stock is currently trading. (See AFRM stock analysis on TipRanks)
