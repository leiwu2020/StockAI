Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Pinnacle West Capital has. Pinnacle West Capital's Debt Based on Pinnacle West Capital's balance sheet as of February 24, 2021, long-term debt is at $6.31 billion and current debt is at $225.96 million, amounting to $6.54 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $59.97 million in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $6.48 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Pinnacle West Capital has $20.02 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.33. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Why Shareholders Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.

company,1615912027,ROCE Insights For Pinnacle West Capital,66388950,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,PNW,Yahoo,"Pinnacle West Capital (NYSE:PNW) posted Q4 earnings of $45.02 million, an increase from Q3 of 90.4%. Sales dropped to $740.96 million, a 40.94% decrease between quarters. In Q3, Pinnacle West Capital earned $469.13 million and total sales reached $1.25 billion. Why ROCE Is Significant Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q4, Pinnacle West Capital posted an ROCE of 0.01%. Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future. View more earnings on PNW Return on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders. In Pinnacle West Capital's case, the positive ROCE ratio will be something investors pay attention to before making long-term financial decisions. Q4 Earnings Insight Pinnacle West Capital reported Q4 earnings per share at $-0.17/share, which did not meet analyst predictions of $0.04/share.

company,1611847135,Understanding Pinnacle West Capital's Ex-Dividend Date,66388960,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,PNW,Yahoo,"Pinnacle West Capital (NYSE:PNW) declared a dividend payable on March 1, 2021 to its shareholders as of December 16, 2020. It was also announced that shareholders of Pinnacle West Capital's stock as of February 1, 2021 are entitled to the dividend. The stock is expected to become ex-dividend 1 business day(s) before the record date. Pinnacle West Capital, which has a current dividend per share of $0.83, has an ex-dividend date scheduled for January 29, 2021. That equates to a dividend yield of 4.15% at current price levels. The Significance Of An Ex-Dividend Date Ex-dividend dates are when company shares stop trading with their current dividend payouts in preparation for those companies to announce new ones. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Most ex-dividend dates operate on a quarterly basis. Understanding Pinnacle West Capital's Dividend History Over the past year, Pinnacle West Capital has seen its dividend payouts and yields climb upward overall. Last year (January 31, 2020), the company's payout sat at $0.78, which has since increased by $0.05. Pinnacle West Capital's dividend yield last year was 3.53%, which has since grown by 0.62%. Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market.
