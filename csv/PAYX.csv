A spike in coronavirus in Asia and Australia appears to be fueling some concerns. Those concerns are curtailing any movement to the upside, following last week’s bounce-back.



The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures was down 0.15%, Nasdaq Futures up 0.17% and S&P 500 down 0.03% at the time of writing, pointing to a cautious open later in the day. A cool-down in the bullish momentum comes after the major indices reached record highs last week on weaker-than-expected U.S. inflation data. News of a bipartisan U.S. infrastructure agreement also helped boost risk appetite, sending the major indices higher.



Once the North America session opens, the focus will be on Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (JEF), LiveXLive Media Inc. (LIVX), High Tide Inc. (HITI), WeTrade Group Inc. (WETG), and Key Energy Services Inc. (KEGX). All of those companies are expected to report their quarterly earnings reports.



Virgin Galactic (SPCE) was the most active in pre-market trading. The stock was up by 6.06%, with 922.84K shares exchanging hands at the time of writing. The spike came on the heels of the company's confirmation that it had been granted a license by the Federal Aviation Administration to fly passengers on future spaceflights.



Torchlight Energy (TRCH) was the biggest gainer, with its shares jumping 140.20% on a volume of 48.04K shares at the time of writing. The rally comes on the company's announcement that it has paid a special Series A preferred stock Dividend. The company has also implemented a 1 for 2 reverse stock split of its common stock.



Greenland Technologies (GTEC) was the biggest loser in pre-market activity at the time of writing, dropping by 15.44% on a volume of 14.48k shares. The slide comes just days after the technology developer and manufacturer of industrial electric vehicles confirmed plans to offer ordinary shares for sale in an underwritten public offering. The company intends to use net proceeds from the offering for general corporate and working capital needs.



In M&A news, Amazon (AMZN) cloud unit Amazon Web Services is acquiring Wickr, a company that specializes in developing secure end-to-end encrypted communication technology. The technology should strengthen AWS messaging capabilities, allowing cloud users access to advanced security features not available in traditional messaging services.



“Enterprise customers use Wickr to keep communications between employees and business partners private, while remaining compliant with regulatory requirements,” said AWS in a press release.



Additionally, Rockwell Automation (ROK) has reached an agreement to acquire Plex Systems in a $2.22 billion transaction. The provider of industrial automation and digital transformation intends to finance the all-cash deal through short-term and long-term debt. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.



Blake Moret, the company’s Chairman and CEO, said, “This acquisition will accelerate our strategy to bring the Connected Enterprise to life, driving faster time to value for our customers, as they increasingly adopt cloud solutions to improve resilience, agility, and sustainability in their operations.”



Paychex (PAYX) shares jumped 1.3% after the company reported impressive Q4 financial results for the fiscal quarter ended May 31. Adjusted earnings were up 18% year-over-year to $0.72 a share, as revenue rose 12% year-over-year to $1.03 billion. Earnings beat consensus estimates of $0.67 a share, and revenue topped estimates of $980.48 million.



President and CEO of Paychex Martin Mucci said, “Our fourth quarter results were driven by record client retention levels, record sales results, and stronger checks per client, which were driven by improving macroeconomic conditions and gains in employment.”



Facebook (FB) is planning to make it possible for Instagram users to share and post content using desktop computers. Bloomberg reports that the social networking giant has been testing the desktop posting and sharing feature.



“We know that many people access Instagram from their computer…To improve that experience, we’re now testing the ability to create a Feed post on Instagram with their desktop browser.” said Christine Pai, Facebook spokeswoman.



Apple (AAPL) is seeking a five-year extension on its planning permit for its $1 billion data center in Galway, Western Ireland. According to the Business Post, if successful, the company will have until 2026 to build the data center. As it stands, the company has until September 21 to have the facility up and running.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d10ba10dc86051d207d911b2723bd6d83f9cf218fa0627b6171ea052cd9a8cc5

The company offers insurance, retirement, payroll, and human resource (HR) services.



Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) grew 18% year-over-year to $0.72 per share, beating the Street’s estimates of $0.67. (See Paychex stock chart on TipRanks)



Total revenue rose 12% year-over-year to $1.03 billion, surpassing analysts’ expectations of $980.48 million. Management Solutions revenue went up 14% to $ 756.4 million, and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) and Insurance Solutions revenue rose 13% to $258.3 million.



President and CEO of Paychex Martin Mucci said, “Our fourth quarter results were driven by record client retention levels, record sales results, and stronger checks per client, which were driven by improving macroeconomic conditions and gains in employment.”



For the fiscal year ending May 31, 2022, the company expects total revenue to grow by 7% and adjusted EPS to rise by 10% to 12%. The company also anticipates revenue from Management Solutions to go up by nearly 7%, and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue to increase in the range of 8% to 10%.



Jefferies analyst Samad Samana recently maintained a Hold rating on the stock and increased the price target from $95 to $115 (9% upside potential).



Samana views Paychex’s strong client base growth and ""encouraging"" macro commentary as a boost for his coverage of the HR/payroll sector.



Overall, the stock has a Hold consensus rating based on 3 Buys, 6 Holds, and 2 Sells. The average Paychex analyst price target of $101.36 implies 4% downside potential from current levels. The company’s shares have gained 17% over the past year.

The report is expected to provide additional information on the status of U.S. inflation and is also expected to weigh heavily on the Federal Reserve's next policy action.



Ahead of the open, Dow futures had risen 0.3%, while Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures were trading 0.1% higher at the time of writing.



51job Inc (JOBS), Carmax Inc (KMX), Concord Medical Services Holdings Ltd (CCM), Paychex Inc (PAYX), and Quhuo Ltd (QH), are among the companies expected to release their quarterly earnings today.



Torchlight Energy (TRCH) was the most actively traded stock at the time of writing and was looking to open around 6.5% higher. The spike comes as the prices of oil and natural gas, two commodities that underpin the company's core business, edge higher. The bullish momentum could also be attributed to Torchlight Energy emerging as a meme stock on social media in recent days.



Fuwei Films (FFHL) was the biggest gainer at the time of writing, exploding around 65%, on volume of approximately 1 million shares. The spike comes as the manufacturer and distributor of high-quality BOPER plastic films delivered impressive unaudited Q1 results. Net sales for the quarter were up 22.1% to $15.5 million. Net profit more than doubled to $4.8 million.



Condor Hospitality (CDOR) was the biggest loser in pre-market trading, tanking 10.5% at the time of writing. The slide comes just days after the company announced its board of directors is evaluating strategic alternatives aimed at enhancing shareholder value.



BlackBerry (BB) delivered solid first-quarter results that topped analysts' estimates. Revenue came in at $174 million compared to the $171.25 million expected but slid 16% year-on-year. On the other hand, net loss narrowed to $62 million, or $0.11 a share, compared to the $636 million loss reported in the same period last year.



BlackBerry Executive Chairman and CEO said, “This quarter we aligned the business around the two key market opportunities – IoT and Cyber Security. In IoT we are pleased with the strong progress of the auto business, despite global chip shortage headwinds.”Nike (NKE) shares jumped 14% after the footwear and apparel company delivered a blowout fourth quarter. Revenue in the quarter jumped 96% to $12.3 billion, topping the Street's estimates of $11.1 billion. Earnings came in at $0.93 a share compared to a net loss of $0.51 a share reported the same period last year.



NIKE CEO John Donahoe said, “FY21 was a pivotal year for NIKE as we brought our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy to life across the marketplace. Fueled by our momentum, we continue to invest in innovation and our digital leadership to set the foundation for NIKE’s long-term growth.”



FedEx (FDX) also reported strong fourth-quarter and annual results on the back of volume growth and disciplined revenue and portfolio management. Adjusted earnings nearly doubled to $5.01 a share, topping analysts' estimates of $4.99 a share. Revenue was up 30% to $22.56 billion, surpassing Street estimates of $21.51 billion.



Chairman and CEO of FDX Frederick W. Smith said, “We continue to play an important role in global economic recovery and the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines and relief supplies throughout the U.S., Canada and more than 35 other countries. I am optimistic about the future of FedEx as we continue to innovate for our customers and meet strong demand for our global transportation network and capabilities.”



In M&A news, eBay (EBAY) has reached an agreement to offload a majority stake in its Korean Business to Emart. The company is selling an 80.01% stake in G-9, G-Market, and IAC for $3 billion. It will retain a 19.9% stake in the business valued at about $0.8 billion.



eBay CEO Jamie Iannone stated, “This deal brings together two strong e-commerce and retail companies that can unlock tremendous potential in Korea and provide more choice for customers. We believe this move further optimizes our portfolio and creates value for eBay shareholders.”



Panasonic offloaded its shares in Tesla (TSLA) in the fiscal year ended March 2021, receiving $3.61 billion in the process.

Meanwhile, Paychex's (PAYX) operating income came in flat at $468.6 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were down 1% year-over-year to $0.96 a share. Additionally, Paychex ended the quarter with cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments of $1.1 billion.

However, according to CEO Martin Mucci, Paychex continues to see progress regarding key indicators. “Client retention remains strong and at record levels, and our results for the third quarter show that our resilient business model has helped us navigate the uncertainties created by COVID-19,” Mucci said.

For the fiscal year ending May 31, 2021, Paychex is projecting total revenue growth to be in the range of -2% to flat. Adjusted operating margin is anticipated to be between 36% and 37%, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to decline 2% or to remain flat. (See Paychex stock analysis on TipRanks)

Following the third-quarter financial results, BMO Capital analyst Jeffrey Silber raised the price target to $96 from $93, implying a 1.26% upside potential to current levels. According to the analyst, ""results were better than expected, driven by better than expected margins.”

The consensus rating for Paychex is a Hold based on 3 Buys, 3 Holds, and 2 Sells. The average analyst price target on the stock is $97, implying a 2.3% upside potential to current levels.

Based on TipRanks' Smart Score rating system, PAYX scores a 9 out of 10, suggesting it is likely to outperform the overall market.
