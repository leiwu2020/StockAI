company,1614950243,A Look Into Colgate-Palmolive's Debt,66919545,,CL,Yahoo,"Shares of Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) decreased by 12.60% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Colgate-Palmolive has. Colgate-Palmolive's Debt Based on Colgate-Palmolive's balance sheet as of February 18, 2021, long-term debt is at $7.33 billion and current debt is at $267.00 million, amounting to $7.60 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $888.00 million in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $6.71 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Colgate-Palmolive has $15.92 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.48. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and average for another. Why Debt Is Important Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital. However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.
