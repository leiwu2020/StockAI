Its addition to the MSCI China Index was announced earlier in May as part of a quarterly review.Perennial dramatically pared a one-year gain of 446% through Thursday -- when trading turnover in the stock hit a record high of HK$1.3 billion ($168 million). By the close of trade on Friday, the year-over-year advance was just 68%.A company representative said they could not immediately comment on the share decline when contacted by Bloomberg. A spokesperson for MSCI didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Perennial’s net income jumped 58% last year, but its free cash flow has been negative for two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.It’s not the first time that a company selected by MSCI has quickly slumped upon joining one of its benchmarks. Hebei Construction Group Corp. tumbled 60% in Hong Kong on Dec. 1, the first day it was in the MSCI China All Shares Index. ArtGo Holdings Ltd., which had soared almost 3,800% in 2019, erased nearly all of that advance in minutes after MSCI dropped plans to add the stock to its measures.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b038adca981cd7432241d888a2714bbe78f6030f0ce00149bf6b0f1679640d35

Not Very Sustainably,67796069,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/C6LWEWSBXh4ZONUaP7JvkQ--~B/aD04MzI7dz0xMjk2O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/123a5727e1203cae7976629aa330635a,MSCI,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- When it comes to investing their own money to tackle climate-change or promote better corporate governance, European Central Bank officials are decidedly average.Members of the ECB’s Governing Council and Supervisory Board keep nearly half of their private investments in assets that rank “average” or “laggard” on a sustainability scale devised by MSCI Inc., according to an analysis by Bloomberg News of publicly available declarations of interest.A quarter of the fund or equity securities owned by the policy makers are considered “leaders” in environmental, social and governance criteria, or ESG. More than a quarter were unrated.The results highlight the challenge of shifting the financial industry toward greater action on climate change and other goals such as corporate gender balance or labor rights, even by committed professionals. The process of divesting from companies that harm the environment or assessing compliance with social targets is messy and takes time -- as evidenced by Bill Gates’ long exit from fossil fuels.ECB President Christine Lagarde has voiced support for the European Union’s efforts to transition to a more climate-friendly economy and has promoted gender parity in the workplace since taking over leadership of the institution in 2019.“The shift to net-zero emissions, together with an adequate digital backbone, will require major investments across Europe in technology, infrastructure and networks,” Lagarde said on May 6, while calling for more regulatory action to support sustainable finance.An ECB spokesman declined to comment on the officials’ portfolios.Ratings that assess resilience to environmental, social or governance risks can offer indications on sustainability for investors, but they are also relatively new and suffer from a lack of comparable data. Lagarde and other officials have said that the difficulty of measuring climate and other risks impedes the use of such ratings to measure change in the industry.Own PortfolioWhile the ECB is still debating to what extent it can justifiably integrate climate goals into its monetary policy, officials have pledged to increase exposure to green investments in the “own funds” portfolio it uses to generate income for operating expenses.When it comes to officials’ private investments, the disclosures reveal few securities that directly tackle the range of concerns embodied in ESG ratings. MSCI’s metrics measure the resilience of companies and funds to long-term, industry-specific ESG risks, with ratings ranging from leader (AAA, AA), average (A, BBB, BB) to laggard (B, CCC).For instance, Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel holds 11 assets that fall into MSCI’s ESG “leader” category -- including shares in Microsoft Corp. and SAP SE -- and 27 that are rated average.Schnabel has one of the most extensive portfolios of all the Governing Council members, and has talked about the need to diversify investments. In a podcast released on May 12, she also said her thinking about how central banks should deal with with the environmental threat has changed.“Once one appreciates how important the financial sector is for this green transition, one has to admit that we as central bankers have to think about our role in the fight against climate change,” she said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c62eb3050ddd993fcb5844662df33cf8949b2d65401154334b8462b38314a765

Meituan paced declines after the Chinese e-commerce giant’s business practices were criticized by an influential consumer advocacy group, just days after the company’s CEO shared and then deleted a poem on social media that some interpreted as a veiled criticism of Beijing.Losses in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. helped send MSCI Inc.’s gauge of Asian tech stocks to its biggest drop since Feb. 26, while futures on the Nasdaq 100 extended declines after a 2.6% drop on Monday.Chinese tech giants have borne the brunt of the sector’s retreat this month, after regulators expanded an antitrust crackdown and announced steps to rein in the companies’ fast-growing finance units.The stocks had benefited from a flood of money into the global tech sector last year, when the pandemic stoked demand for online services and low interest rates encouraged investors to overlook frothy equity prices. Now concern is mounting that commodity-fueled inflation will prompt central banks to tighten monetary policy, denting the appeal of stocks whose valuations often hinge on earnings prospects far into the future. With the Nasdaq 100 still trading about 5% from its all-time high last month, some market participants see a good window to take profits.Investors “continue to place their focus on the inflation narrative, with rising commodities prices and chip shortages in play,” said Yeap Jun Rong, a market strategist at IG Asia Pte. “Concerns of higher inflation may weigh on growth stocks.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2c6585ff38a8fb0e6816c751bb1b9b24df0085b794da922060b1c699d785cd86

They are also looking ahead to President Joe Biden’s pitch for a large social-spending package to Congress Wednesday and a renewed commitment from the Federal Reserve to allow inflation to run hot.“The inflation question will continually return to investors’ minds this year,” said Andy Wong, senior investment manager of the international multi-asset team at Pictet Asset Management in Hong Kong. “The U.S. household balance sheet is the healthiest it has been for years, and ‘excess savings meets disrupted supply chains’ means dislocation in supply and demand.”The reflation trade had hit a wall this month, with havens such as Treasuries rallying and cyclical shares underperforming as spikes in Covid-19 infection rates around the world forced renewed lockdowns in major economies. But the relentless rise in commodity prices has pushed inflation expectations out of their lull and some strategists expect the rally to continue.Goldman Says Commodities Will Power On as Oil Demand Leaps The sharp increases in the cost of materials are motivating companies such as Procter & Gamble Co. and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. to pass on costs to consumers -- moves that raise questions about the Fed’s assurances that any bump in inflation will be short-lived. The 10-year breakeven rate, a proxy for where investors see annual inflation rates over the next decade, topped 2.4% Tuesday -- the highest since April 2013.“There’s some skepticism there as to whether it is transitory, given the delays in supply chains and potentially some productive capacity destruction as a result of lockdowns,” said Anthony Doyle, global cross-asset investment specialist at Fidelity Investment Management in Sydney.Gundlach Says Fed Is Guessing That Inflation Will Be TransitoryStill, not everyone is ready to pile back into the reflation trades that gripped markets earlier this year. An MSCI Inc. gauge of global value shares -- which have high exposure to economic growth -- has lagged its more defensive growth counterpart by nearly 4 percentage points this month and has barely budged this week.BlackRock Inc. has turned neutral from overweight on U.S. inflation-linked bonds after the recent rebound in inflation expectations. The world’s largest asset manager has also cut its short positioning in Treasuries.BlackRock Cuts Inflation-Haven Bond Bet, Stays Bullish on StocksNevertheless, it’s harder to dismiss inflation risks given the positive surprises in recent economic reports.“All of the better data points to a higher-inflation narrative that the market is reflecting,” said Rob Daly, director of fixed income for Glenmede Investment Management in Philadelphia.(Updates throughout.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a18a675b390354c9eff5eb5616b5694bce802d50dd3a246c948b864add94db89

(NYSE: MSCI), a leading provider of critical decision support tools and services for the global investment community, to expand MSCI’s thematic index suite with the launch of new indexes that aim to capture long-term, cutting edge themes that will disrupt the life sciences, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry groups. Royalty Pharma will provide expertise on various medical conditions, clinical trials, transformative therapies, and technologies that may lead to breakthrough medical treatments that will assist MSCI to design a classification framework and index methodologies. The initial indexes will measure the performance of companies focused on delivering new and innovative therapeutic treatments related to virology and oncology. Pablo Legorreta, founder and Chief Executive Officer at Royalty Pharma, stated: “As a leading funder of innovation in life sciences, we are extremely excited to collaborate with MSCI to develop innovative index solutions that will be licensed as the basis for indexed financial products such as ETFs targeting this dynamic sector. This collaboration leverages Royalty Pharma’s deep clinical and scientific knowledge built over decades, as well as the unique capabilities of our Strategy and Analytics team. This venture represents another example of Royalty Pharma’s creative approach to monetizing its existing intellectual capital through the creation of indexes that support investment in life sciences.” Henry Fernandez, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at MSCI, said: “The Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on all aspects of society and has proven to be an accelerant for long-term, structural changes, particularly in the life sciences. As we have seen during this time, life sciences companies are pivotal to shaping and advancing the healthcare industry and have been critical to the development of approaches for prevention and treatment of diseases. MSCI is thrilled to partner with Royalty Pharma to design thematic indexes that capture companies at the forefront of this evolving landscape and having a positive impact on the future of our world.” The MSCI indexes are planned to launch later this year. About Royalty Pharma plc Founded in 1996, Royalty Pharma is the largest buyer of biopharmaceutical royalties and a leading funder of innovation across the biopharmaceutical industry, collaborating with innovators from academic institutions, research hospitals and not-for-profits through small and mid-cap biotechnology companies to leading global pharmaceutical companies. Royalty Pharma has assembled a portfolio of royalties which entitles it to payments based directly on the top-line sales of many of the industry’s leading therapies. Royalty Pharma funds innovation in the biopharmaceutical industry both directly and indirectly - directly when it partners with companies to co-fund late-stage clinical trials and new product launches in exchange for future royalties, and indirectly when it acquires existing royalties from the original innovators. Royalty Pharma’s current portfolio includes royalties on more than 45 commercial products, including AbbVie and J&J’s Imbruvica, Astellas and Pfizer’s Xtandi, Biogen’s Tysabri, Gilead’s Trodelvy, Merck’s Januvia, Novartis’ Promacta, and Vertex’s Kalydeco, Orkambi, Symdeko and Trikafta, and five development-stage product candidates.

Adani Green Energy Ltd. and Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone Ltd. are already there.The potential inclusions are seen further boosting wealth for Adani, who has added $20.2 billion to his net worth this year, the second-biggest increase among the world’s billionaires. The tycoon -- who started out as a commodities trader in the late 1980s -- has diversified from mines, ports and power plants into airports, data centers and defense. The rally in stocks shows investors have rewarded his strategy of interlocking his group’s interests with the Indian government’s infrastructure program.There is “very high probability of these Adani names to come in the index primarily due to the surge in their market capitalization,” Brian Freitas, a New Zealand-based analyst at Smartkarma, said by phone. “ETFs and other passive funds will have to buy, adding to Adani’s fortune.”Passive funds may have to buy shares worth about $830 million in total in the three companies after their inclusion, according to calculations by Freitas. Still, these stocks “trade much much higher than their global peers and longer-term returns may not be worth the risks involved,” he wrote in a note Wednesday.Meanwhile, S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a statement Monday that it will remove Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone from the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes because of links to Myanmar military.A lack of analyst coverage for many of the Adani group’s companies hasn’t deterred MSCI from adding their stocks as the index provider’s focus is more on other factors such as market value. Adani Green, which was added to the MSCI India gauge end-November, still has no analysts covering it, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Freitas also sees the possibility of Adani Green being included in the NSE Nifty 50 Index, the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.’s benchmark gauge, once the bourse allows derivative contracts on the stock.Adani group shares traded mixed amid a broad decline in Indian equities on Thursday. Adani Transmission jumped 5%, Adani Total Gas climbed 2.3% while Adani Ports rose 0.2% as of 10:28 a.m. in Mumbai. Adani Enterprises and Adani Green fell about 1.2% each.MSCI is set to declare the results of its latest review on May 11 and changes will be effective from close of trading on May 28, according to an announcement by the index provider in February.“We do not comment on market speculation on index changes,” a spokeswoman for MSCI wrote in an emailed response.(Adds more details in the eighth paragraph, Thursday’s share performance in the ninth.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d5e6f600830af4857c5ad1efde17960ed2b39c1b4d79299acc951eb69652a461
