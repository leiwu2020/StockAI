Using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, let us compare two healthcare companies, UnitedHealth and Humana, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.







UnitedHealth Group (UNH)



UnitedHealth Group offers diversified healthcare services. The company has two business platforms, Optum and UnitedHealthcare, and has four reportable business segments including OptumHealth, OptumInsight, OptumRx, and UnitedHealthcare.



The company reported better-than-expected financial results in Q2 and posted revenues of $71.3 billion, up 14.8% year-over-year. Adjusted EPS came in at $4.70 versus $7.12 in the same quarter a year back.



UNH raised its outlook for FY21 based on its fiscal performance in the first half of the year and now expects adjusted EPS to come in at $18.30 to $18.80 per share. UNH stated in its press release, “The outlook continues to include approximately $1.80 per share in potential net unfavorable COVID-19 effects.”



Following the Q2 results, Oppenheimer analyst Michael Wiederhorn reiterated a Buy and raised the price target from $440 to $465 on the stock.



Wiederhorn noted that UNH’s management said that the treatment or testing costs for COVID-19 were highest in April, but decreased after that. UNH’s CFO John Rex noted at the company’s Q2 earnings call that while utilization of healthcare services among commercial patients was slightly above baseline, utilization among Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries was still not at their usual rates, so costs remained below the baseline.



UNH’s UnitedHealthcare offers a complete spectrum of health benefit programs. This includes offering consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services to commercial customers, including public sector and mid-sized employers. This segment also serves Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. (See UnitedHealth stock chart on TipRanks)



The company serves Medicaid beneficiaries in exchange “for a monthly premium per member from the state program.” To determine payments for treating Medicare patients, the Medicare risk adjustment (MRA) model assigns a risk score to each Medicare beneficiary based on certain parameters, and this risk score is used to calculate a risk-adjusted base payment amount. This amount is then used to calculate total reimbursement for Medicare beneficiaries.



When it comes to Medicare risk adjustment (MRA) revenues, Wiederhorn is of the view that these will rebound next year. The reason for the analyst’s optimism is that UNH noted that the mid-year risk-adjustment payment for this year “was in line with expectations."" Additionally, he liked UnitedHealth's statement that its physicians are well engaged with their patients, indicated by the fact that the number of house calls provided by its clinicians nearly doubled from the first half of last year to 1.1 million visits in 1H21.



In conclusion, Wiederhorn said, “We believe the company is positioned well for growth in 2022. Management acknowledges that the trajectory of COVID-19 is unpredictable, but the $1.80/share impact is largely expected to go away next year. This would seem to suggest 2022 growth could exceed its normal 13–16% longterm target by a healthy portion of that $1.80 impact (~9%).”



Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 16 Buys and 2 Holds. The average UnitedHealth price target of $461.29 implies approximately 10.1% upside potential to current levels.







Humana (HUM)



Humana has three business segments including Retail, Group and Specialty, and Healthcare services. Most of its products or plans under the three business segments are centered around the Medicare program.



Humana is expected to release its Q2 results on July 28.



In Q1, HUM reported adjusted revenues of $20.75 billion, up by around 10% year-over-year from $18.9 billion. Adjusted diluted earnings came in at $7.67 per share versus $5.40 per share.



Following the Q1 earnings, Humana updated its EPS outlook for FY21 and anticipates it to range between $19.62 to $20.12 per share on a GAAP basis. HUM expects EPS to come in between $21.25 to $21.75 per share on an adjusted basis.



Last month, Humana held its Investor Day. Following the Investor Day presentation, Oppenheimer analyst Michael Wiederhorn reiterated a Buy and a price target of $480 on the stock.



Humana stated at its Investor Day that it expects to have exposure of $56,000 per year to the cost of Aduhelm, Biogen’s (BIIB) Alzheimer’s drug that was recently approved. The company added that it will bear these costs ""at least until they can adjust bids in 2023.”



Wiederhorn commented, “However, management expects a slow up-take as not all patients are appropriate, and the medical hurdles take time. Additionally, the government could share part/all of the burden. Humana believes its Alzheimer's exposure is similar to Medicare (~10% of beneficiaries).”



Additionally, Humana is a provider of Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, and its pharmacy solutions manage prescription drug coverage for individuals and employer groups. The company stated at its Investor Day that while it expects a mid-year MRA payment update on July 1,  HUM management expects volatility from this release. That's because 25% of Medicare members “are in their first full-year with HUM” as a result of the pandemic. (See Humana stock chart on TipRanks)



In other news, last week, Humana agreed to acquire One Homecare Solutions (onehome) from its private equity owner WayPoint Capital Partners for an undisclosed amount. The company expects to complete the acquisition in the second quarter of this year.



Onehome provides home-based health services, pioneering a value-based model in Texas and Florida. It is also a care and risk manager. It offers infusion care, nursing, and durable medical equipment services.



According to Wiederhorn, HUM stated at its Investor Day that “20–35% of total MA spend is addressable in the home and believes its portfolio can address the entire continuum.”



Summing up, the analyst said, “We believe that Humana boasts a compelling growth opportunity in the increasingly appealing MA market. Furthermore, the company also has an opportunity to drive margins given a potentially more favorable reimbursement environment and the maturation of its high-growth member base. Given the attractive growth of the company's MA business, we believe Humana should return significant returns to shareholders.”



Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 9 Buys and 5 Holds. The average Humana price target of $490.54 implies approximately 5.2% upside potential to current levels.







Bottom Line



While analysts are cautiously optimistic about Humana, they are bullish about UnitedHealth Group. Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, UNH does seem to be a better Buy.

company,1625642339,Clover Health Offers Grocery Benefit Under MA Plan – Report,68646856,https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?1472767539,HUM,Nasdaq,"Healthcare technology firm Clover Health Investments (CLOV) is offering its members a grocery benefit just like other Medicare Advantage (MA) players, according to a report by Yahoo Finance.



Based in Tennessee, Clover provides healthcare insurance services. It makes use of its proprietary technology platform to gather, analyze and structure behavioral and health data in order to reduce patient costs and improve medical outcomes.



The CEO of Clover Health Investments, Vivek Garipalli, said, ""The company aims to provide its members access to healthy food via this benefit."" (See Clover stock chart on TipRanks)



Clover expects each member to get between $300 and $500 per year in grocery benefit. The members will be reimbursed the amount every quarter in a phased manner throughout the year.



The benefit is expected to receive approval from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services by mid-September. Companies like Humana Inc. (HUM) and Centene (CNC) are already offering this benefit.



Clover’s shares closed 14.6% lower on Tuesday but gained 2.1% in pre-market trading on Wednesday.



Last month, Bank of America Securities analyst Kevin Fischbeck downgraded the rating on the stock to Sell from Hold but maintained a price target of $10, which is in line with the current price.



The analyst said, “The recent reduction in management’s growth targets for MA and Direct Contracting (DC) significantly hampers visibility into the company’s prospects.”



Overall, the stock has a Hold consensus rating based on 1 Buy, 1 Hold and 1 Sell. The Clover Health Investments price target of $9.67 implies 3.3% downside potential from current levels. Shares of the company have lost 36% year-to-date.

It did not disclose financial details of the deal but expects to complete the acquisition in the second quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory approvals.



Onehome provides home-based health services, pioneering a value-based model in Texas and Florida. It is also a care and risk manager. It offers infusion care, nursing, and durable medical equipment services. Launched in 2013, Onehome serves more than a million health plan members across the U.S., including Humana members since 2015.



Humana counts on onehome to expand its value-based home care offering. It said that the deal for onehome aligns with its recent announcement to acquire Kindred at Home. The need for home-based patient care has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to onehome, which says it shares Humana’s mission of bringing healing home.



“We are proud of the longstanding partnership between onehome and Humana, and their shared vision to offer value-based care in the home,” said WayPoint’s Philip Edmunds.



“We believe we can create a transformational value-based offering to serve more people, including non-Humana plan members, nationwide,” said Susan Diamond, Humana’s interim CFO and segment president for Home Business.



Humana does not expect the pending Onehome acquisition to materially impact its 2021 earnings. (See Humana stock analysis on TipRanks)



Wells Fargo analyst Steve Baxter initiated coverage on Humana stock with a Hold rating and a price target of $472. Baxter’s price target implies 13.7% upside potential.



The analyst observed that Humana has the greatest exposure to Medicare Advantage’s most attractive end market. However, competition could cause its enrollment growth to lag the market.



“HUM is clearly a strong company in good markets, but from a stock perspective we see better risk/reward elsewhere,"" noted Baxter.



Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 8 Buys and 4 Holds. The Humana average analyst price target of $488.58 implies 17.7% upside potential to current levels.



HUM scores a 6 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, suggesting that the stock is likely to perform in line with market averages.

The valuation includes the $2.4 billion equity stake in Kindred that Humana now holds.Kindred at Home has locations in 40 states and serves more than 550,000 patients a year with home-health and hospice care.Humana will fund the $5.7 billion transaction with a combination of cash and debt, the company said. The deal isn’t expected to have a material effect on earnings in 2021, and will “provide modest additional financial flexibility for 2022,” according to the company. Humana is scheduled to post first-quarter results early Wednesday.The private-equity firms and Humana bought Kindred Healthcare in 2017 and split the company into two pieces. The investment firms kept the long-term acute care and rehabilitation facilities, while Humana took a minority stake in the home-care assets, Kindred at Home. At the time, Humana said the implied enterprise value of the business was $3.15 billion.Traditional health insurers have been moving deeper into the business of taking care of patients. Humana rival Cigna Corp. purchased telehealth provider MDLive this year. UnitedHealth Group Inc., the largest U.S. insurer, has assembled a giant care-delivery arm in its Optum division with more than 53,000 physicians.Humana is a top seller of private Medicare Advantage plans, in which the company receives set premiums from the U.S. government for taking care of elderly members.“We continue to invest in assets that allow Humana to better manage the holistic needs of our members and patients by expanding care in the home,” Humana Chief Executive Officer Bruce Broussard said in the statement.Humana recently announced a new health-services brand called CenterWell. Kindred at Home will be integrated with Humana’s existing home-care business and re-branded CenterWell Home Health, the company said.Humana said the Kindred at Home hospice and community-care assets are included in the transaction, but the company plans to hold only a minority interest in that part of the business. It’s exploring a public listing or another transaction, according to the release. Kindred at Home CEO David Causby will lead that “future independent company,” Humana said.The acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter.(Updates with additional details throughout)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=cecd1c4697092fbe1de001757aabe4914fe25abc2777443f5129ee49014a2d13

Availity as a whole is worth $2 billion, including debt, the people said.Representatives for Francisco and Availity declined to comment on the sales process.A spokesperson added in a statement that the company “is enjoying a period of rapid growth, having added 10 new health plans and hundreds of thousands of new providers to the platform in the last two years.”Francisco led a growth equity investment in the company in 2017 with its existing investors, a group that included Anthem Inc., Humana Inc. and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota, according to a statement at the time. Insurer Health Care Service Corp. and Florida Blue are also investors, a spokesperson said.Jacksonville, Florida-based Availity says it runs the nation’s biggest real-time information network that connects providers, health plans and technology partners. It has the goal of disrupting “an antiquated health-care system” by improving the ways stakeholders communicate with each other, according to its website.Founded in 2001 as a joint venture between Humana and Florida Blue, Availity also helps health-care providers with the complex, back-end administrative processes behind moving money between insurers and medical providers.(Updates with comment from Availity starting in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4fd0cf213e2e56404b8c1e5833ca02e1e671fd1dc7df899df14e836a7b6ceb37

Under the engagement, Inovalon will implement the Inovalon ONE® Platform Vaccine Adherence Program, leveraging established healthcare ecosystem connectivity, data integration, normalization, and analyses to assess clinical applicability and adherence of health plan members to applicable Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) immunization schedules and guidelines. Analytical insights delivered through the data-driven program will inform member engagement and disease education efforts to promote uptake of recommended vaccines, resulting in improved health outcomes, quality ratings and overall public health, as well as significant economic benefits stemming from reductions in vaccine-preventable disease incidence and associated treatment costs. The broader Inovalon and Humana engagement dates back to early 2019 with the implementation of a configuration of the Inovalon ONE® Platform focused on achieving advanced insight into member conditions and the subsequent empowering of data-driven initiatives to benefit Humana’s Commercial membership. A leading specialty pharmacy operator, Humana expanded the relationship later in 2019 to include Inovalon’s ScriptMed® Cloud offering, a configuration of the Inovalon ONE® Platform designed to combine superior analytically driven care protocols with superior quality, operational processes, and cost efficiencies for pharmacies. In early 2020, Humana added Inovalon’s Virtual Health Visit capabilities and later in 2020 expanded the application of the Inovalon ONE® Platform to Humana’s Medicare membership. “We are very pleased and appreciative to expand our relationship with such an industry innovator as Humana,” said Keith Dunleavy, M.D., chief executive officer of Inovalon. “Humana’s commitment to their members’ quality of care as well as their commitment to partnership in progressing programs together has been remarkable.” About Inovalon Inovalon is a leading provider of cloud-based platforms empowering data-driven healthcare. Through the Inovalon ONE® Platform, Inovalon brings to the marketplace a national-scale capability to interconnect with the healthcare ecosystem, aggregate and analyze data in real time, and empower the application of resulting insights to drive meaningful impact at the point of care. Leveraging its Platform, unparalleled proprietary datasets, and industry-leading subject matter expertise, Inovalon enables better care, efficiency, and financial performance across the healthcare ecosystem. From health plans and provider organizations, to pharmaceutical, medical device, and diagnostics companies, Inovalon’s unique achievement of value is delivered through the effective progression of “Turning Data into Insight, and Insight into Action®.” Supporting thousands of clients, including all 25 of the top 25 U.S. health plans, 22 of the top 25 global pharma companies, 19 of the top 25 U.S. healthcare provider systems, and many of the leading pharmacy organizations, device manufacturers, and other healthcare industry constituents, Inovalon’s technology platforms and analytics are informed by data pertaining to more than one million physicians, 574,000 clinical facilities, 332 million Americans, and 61 billion medical events.
