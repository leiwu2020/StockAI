(TRMB) has agreed to sell its Iron Solutions business to Randall Reilly. While financial terms remained undisclosed, the acquisition is expected to close in Q3.



Trimble’s technology solutions help professionals and field workers in transforming their work processes. Randall-Reilly is a B2B data and analytics platform that provides market intelligence helping deliver better outcomes. It serves transportation, construction, agriculture, and other industrial markets.



Trimble’s Iron Solutions unit provides market intelligence, analytics, and cloud-based enterprise systems to the heavy equipment industry. These services facilitate equipment transactions while also improving the productivity of dealers and lenders.



Randall-Reilly President and CEO Matt Reilly said, “The addition of Iron Guides, a market standard for used equipment valuation among lenders enables us to super-serve both our dealer and buyer audiences.” (See Trimble stock chart on TipRanks)



Rob Painter, President and CEO of Trimble, commented, “As we refocus our efforts on Trimble’s core capabilities, Iron Solutions will be an ideal fit with Randall-Reilly’s existing portfolio of market intelligence solutions.”



Last month, Robert W. Baird analyst Richard Eastman reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $81 from $72. This implies 3.5% upside potential to current price levels.



Eastman noted the stock can be bought into on dips owing to infrastructure/earnings power opportunity and balance sheet optionality.



Based on 3 Buys and 1 Hold, consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy. The TRMB average analyst price target of $87.75 implies 12.1% upside potential. That’s after shares have surged 81.9% over the past year.

After one of the strongest performances of 2020, ARKK has dropped 3.7% this year amid a rough patch for tech shares. Before a flood of cash this week, Ark’s main fund had posted five consecutive days of outflows, its longest streak on record.“This is investors taking advantage to jump in after the drop from the top,” said Athanasios Psarofagis, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “You can see some investors were shaken out because there were some days of outflows during this period but for the most part people held strong so the demand is still there.”ARKK was up 3.1% as of 9:41 a.m. in New York on Thursday, while the space fund rose 1.3%.Ark’s investing strategy and success in luring new cash has spurred big bets on small companies, raising concern the firm exerts an outsize influence over the shares its holds. Wood handed fresh ammunition to her critics last week in a filing that removed prospectus clauses limiting exposure and concentration risks in its ETFs.Bearish bets have been building in ARKK, with short interest climbing to 4.9% of shares outstanding, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd, nearing the record 5.3% hit in early March.Still, none of that has taken any shine off the space fund, with Wood’s first new ETF in two years seeing $294 million worth of shares change hands on its first day.The product’s top two holdings are Trimble Inc. and another Ark vehicle, the 3D Printing ETF (PRNT). Other large stakes include Kratos Defense & Security Solutions Inc., L3Harris Technologies Inc. and JD.com Inc., an online retailer in China.(Updates with Thursday trading, short interest details)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d67d2741c84413062978e3f90ac715af8bb643ecadc761956f4a7199a66ae12c
