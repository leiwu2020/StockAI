Take Coca-Cola or Procter & Gamble stock as an example. Both of these companies have consistently paid dividends for a very long period and uninterruptedly increased it for more than 50 years. That means their shareholders were paid even during the down years. 



Like Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble, several stocks have consistently hiked their dividends. This is important, as a growing dividend reduces the payback period of the initial investment. 



Top Dividend Stocks



Using the TipRanks Dividend Calendar, this article zeroes in on five Strong Buy stocks with an ex-dividend date in July 2021. An ex-dividend date implies that investors must own the stock by that date to be eligible for receiving the next dividend payout. The article also focuses on stocks that have consistently grown dividends for a considerable amount of time and have a sustainable payout ratio.

(LOW) raised its quarterly dividend by 33% to $0.80 per share. Lowe’s is a retail company that specializes in home improvement. The dividend is payable on August 4 to shareholders of record on July 21. Lowe’s annual dividend of $3.20 per share now reflects a dividend yield of 1.7%. On May 19, Lowe’s reported stronger-than-expected Q1 results. The company reported earnings of $3.21 per share, which outpaced the Street’s estimates of $2.62 and rose 81% year over year. Total revenues of $24.4 billion were above the consensus estimate of $23.9 billion and increased 24.1% year over year. (See Lowe’s stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the Q1 earnings announcement, Guggenheim analyst Steven Forbes reiterated a Buy rating on Lowe’s. Forbes said, “LOW’s 1Q 2021 operating results exceeded our expectations, broadly. Importantly, not only was gross margin expansionary (up ~20 basis points year-over-year) in the face of significant lumber inflation—with prices up ~45% quarter-over-quarter—but the company generated a relatively high incremental margin on the top-line beat (based on our estimates), showcasing an elevated level of expense control—resulting in a ~13.30% EBIT margin (up ~310 basis points year-over-year).” Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 17 Buys versus 4 Holds. The average analyst price target stands at $230.71 and implies upside potential of 19.1% to current levels. Shares have gained 51.2% over the past year. Lowe’s scores a 9 of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

(LOW) reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, backed by continued demand for home products. The home improvement company’s sales came in at $24.42 billion, up 24.1% year-over-year, surpassing the Street’s estimates of $23.46 billion. Earnings stood at $3.21 per share, up 81% year-over-year, and beat the Street’s estimates of $2.56 per share.Lowe’s operates as a home improvement retailer in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, offering a line of products for construction, maintenance, repair, remodeling, and decorating.Despite the strong results, shares of the company fell 1% to close at $190.72 on May 19, amid concerns about challenges in the housing market, such as high lumber prices.Consolidated comparable sales were up 25.9% and U.S. comparable sales increased 24.4%.By the end of the quarter, the company operated 1,972 retail stores in the United States and Canada, and serviced around 230 dealer-owned stores. (See Lowe’s stock analysis on TipRanks)Commenting on the results, Marvin R. Ellison, Lowe's president and CEO said, “Our outstanding performance continued this quarter, as we delivered strong sales growth and operating margin expansion. We delivered over 30% growth in Pro, over 18% growth in all 15 U.S. regions, and growth in Canada that outpaced the U.S… Looking forward, I remain confident in our ability to accelerate our market share gains while driving further improvement in operating margin.""During the quarter, the company repurchased shares worth $3.1 billion and paid $440 million in dividends. The company’s current quarter sales are well ahead of its full-year 2021 guidance of $86 billion.In April, Lowe’s completed the acquisition of the STAINMASTER brand, one of the most recognized carpet brands in the U.S., adding to the company’s portfolio of private brands.Recently, Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel assigned a Buy rating to the stock with a price target of $235, which implies 23.2% upside potential to current levels.Nagel said, “While we remain concerned with likely softening sales and earnings trends at the company, as COVID-19 tailwinds continue to abate, we now view LOW as particularly attractive versus shares of other leading hardlines chains, including Home Depot, given a discounted share valuation and still significant business model slack.”Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 17 Buys and 3 Holds. The average analyst price target stands at $229.82 and implies upside potential of 20.5% to current levels. Shares have gained 18.9% year-to-date.Lowe’s scores a “Perfect 10” from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.Related News:Great-West Lifeco Will Host Empower Retirement Investor Day on June 8CAE Q4 Profit Drops 77% on Weaker Aviation Demand; Shares Plunge 8%TerrAscend Q1 Sales More Than Double, Raises Guidance for 2021",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b0338a5795ca6fc0c349ccf1e919a9964bae47efc57dc6e0978f61fbaba52719
