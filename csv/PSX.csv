The largest of the tankers has the capacity to hold 1 million barrels of refined product, they said.The charters come as the outage on the Colonial Pipeline Co. system, which transports about 2.5 million barrels to the East Coast, enters its fourth day. Gas stations from Alabama to Virginia have reported gasoline shortages. Meanwhile, several refiners have rushed to secure ships to store their excess gasoline and diesel production to avoid taking the potentially expensive step of shutting operations until Colonial restarts, according to the people.Before Colonial was attacked by hackers, America’s refiners were ratcheting up their operations to meet an expected spike in demand this summer as newly vaccinated Americans resume major travel. Onshore inventory in the Gulf Coast has already been filling up with their rising fuel production, making the need to find storage after the pipeline hack even more pressing. Filling stations are running dry in the U.S. South as the outage leave limited options for getting fuel to market.Valero and Phillips 66 didn’t respond to emails seeking comment. “We are leveraging our logistics network and commercial relationships as we work to keep our customers supplied with fuel” as market conditions associated with the Colonial shutdown evolve, Marathon spokesman Jamal Kheiry said in an email.The tankers booked so far include Energy Centurion, Khawr Aladid, Ayse C and Nave Titan, they said.Some U.S. refiners have begun curtailing operations. Total SE’s Port Arthur refinery in Texas shut its sole FCC over the weekend, while Citgo Petroleum Corp cut rates at its Lake Charles, Louisiana, refinery. Meanwhile, Danish oil product tanker company Torm said four long-range 2 tankers were booked this week to take refined fuels to the U.S. Atlantic Coast from Europe.Colonial has said it expects to substantially restore service by the end of the week. On Monday, the company manually restored operations on one segment, Line 4, while existing inventory was available.Any cargoes sent to the four foreign-flagged tankers would likely be shipped outside the U.S., even after Colonial returns, the people said. The Jones Act requires that only U.S.-flagged ships transport goods form American port to another.(Updates with carrying capacity of the 4 ships in second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7445085ca119a78b093a72ef9f10f4e0edf2614f0c3e955ed5f5f11cbea71199

The European Union plans to ease curbs for vaccinated travelers this summer, while states around the New York region are set to relax capacity restrictions. That’s offsetting concerns about weaker oil consumption in parts of Asia, including India, where Covid-19 remains rampant.Oil has soared in 2021 -- amid a broad advance across commodity markets -- as investors bet that the rollout of vaccines will permit a return to pre-pandemic conditions. Reflecting that rebound, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday that the U.S. economic recovery is “making real progress,” although he cautioned that the gains have been uneven.“India’s demand is seen pretty weak now, which is a big issue, but the market seems to have moved past that,” said Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at Oanda Asia Pacific. “A lot of that has to do with the vaccination programs, and U.S. and Europe reopening.”The market’s strength so far in May will hearten members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies as they restore some of the barrels they’ve been witholding. Iraq, OPEC’s second-biggest producer, said prices would probably remain around $65 a barrel in the coming months.Still, the health crisis in India remains grave as infections and deaths mount, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi resists appeals to impose another nationwide lockdown across the third-largest oil importer. Elsewhere in Asia, nations including Japan, Thailand, Laos, Nepal and Bhutan have also been reporting significant increases infections over the past few weeks.Oil’s ascent this year forms a key part of a comprehensive advance in raw materials that has also seen gains in metals and crops. Most-active WTI prices surged 7.5% in April following a 22% rally in the first quarter. Brent’s prompt timespread was 43 cents a barrel, compared with 32 cents about a month ago. That’s a bullish pattern, with near-term prices trading above those further out.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7906846fda9d9f4e1aa25f6a0336edd5c26a40349d93cf89091b1f288640be14
