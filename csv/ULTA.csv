The need for masks can now be replaced with a need for makeup with beauty sector stocks possibly seeing an upside as people return to stores to update their products, such as foundation to cover their “maskne” until the irritation fades. Ulta Beauty Inc. (NASDAQ: ULTA), Estée Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE: EL) and LVMH Moet Hennessy Vuitton (OTC: LVMH), which includes Sephora among its brands, are three beauty-focused stocks that could see more upside as the reopening progresses. The Ulta Chart: Ulta’s stock topped out on March 11 when it made a new all-time high of $351. Since then, it has consolidated in a sideways pattern holding a low just above $100. On Friday afternoon, Ulta broke through an overhead resistance level at $321.79 after managing to rise and regain the eight-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) Friday morning. The eight-day EMA is trending below the 21-day EMA, which is bearish, but if Ulta can sustain its move north, the eight-day EMA will cross back above the 21-day EMA, which would give bulls confidence to move forward. Ulta’s stock is trading about 17% above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), which indicates bullish sentiment, and Its relative strength index is sitting at a comfortable 50%, even though the stock moved 3% by mid-day Friday. Bulls want to see continued momentum and for Ulta’s stock to close above $321.79 so the level becomes support. Ulta’s stock could then move up towards the $330 level before bumping into resistance. Bears want to see a rejection of the $322 area and for Ulta’s stock to drop back down and revisit $301.85. If the stock is unable to hold that level of support it could fall toward $289. Ulta’s stock does have a lower gap left behind on Nov. 9 and although gaps fill 90% of the time, the stock is trading 34% above the gap so it may not fill for quite some time. The Estée Lauder Chart: Estée lauder reached an all-time high of $318.34 on April 28 but then gapped down following its earnings print on May 3. The stock has since consolidated sideways holding a low of around $285. On Friday, Estée Lauder attempted to break up over resistance at $297.99, but rejected and wicked from it. Friday’s action did allow Estée Lauder’s stock to regain the support of the eight-day EMA and with the 21-day EMA less than 1% above the share price, it could easily regain that level too with continued momentum. The stock is trading above the 200-day SMA which indicates overall sentiment in the stock is bullish. There is a gap both above and below Estée Lauder’s share price, but because the gap above is closer it's more likely the stock will move up to fill the overhead gap before falling to fill the one below. Bulls want to see continued upward momentum to push Estée Lauder’s stock over the $297 area and for it to regain the 21-day EMA. If it does, the stock has room to move up to fill the gap which coincides with a resistance level at $309.43. Bears want to see Estée Lauder’s stock continue to reject the resistance above and for it to revisit the $280 level. The LVMHF Chart: After briefly losing the eight-day EMA Friday morning, Vuitton’s stock reversed and made a bullish move north. Vuitton is trading just 1.68% below its all-time high of $776.54 and above resistance at $736. The eight-day EMA is trending above the 21-day EMA and Vuitton’s stock is trading above the 200-day SMA, all of which are bullish indicators. Like Ulta and Estee Lauder, Vuitton has a gap below — one large gap between $521 and $544 and a smaller one between $497 and $508. Vuitton’s stock is trading about 28% above either of those price ranges, however, making it less likely that its stock will fill those gaps anytime soon. Bulls want to see large bullish volume break Vuitton’s stock to a new all-time high and for there to be momentum to push it into blue skies. There is no price history to act as resistance in blue skies, so Vuitton could potentially make a large run north. Bears want to see bearish volume knock Vuitton’s stock back down to the $736 level. If the stock was unable to hold that level as support, it could fall to $687 before bouncing. ULTA, EL and LVMHF Price Action: ULTA shares were up 4.05% at $324.28 Friday at market close. EL shares were up 1.88% to $296.48 Friday at market close. LVMHF shares were up 2.86% at $769.92 Friday at market close.

Over the past six months, shares of the cosmetics retailer have rallied nearly 49%. Earnings are expected to see a solid rebound this fiscal year, which ends in January 2022. It still might take time for earnings to bounce back to their high-water mark, which was set in the fiscal year immediately preceding the pandemic. Ulta is adapting to the new normal, shifting away from its prior strategy, which was to expand the number of physical stores and move towards e-commerce-related growth. This plan could prove successful, but continued challenges might make it tough for shares to post additional gains. A Full Recovery For Ulta Stock May Remain Elusive Per Ulta’s results for last quarter, ending Jan. 31, 2021, sales compared to the same quarter in the prior year, before the pandemic hit, were down by only around 4.6%. In anticipation of these better-than-expected results, investors aggressively bid up shares, as seen by the jump from around $210 per share last November to $347.50 in March. (See ULTA stock analysis on TipRanks) That said, based on the company’s guidance, challenges remain. Outgoing CEO Mary Dillon remains confident that Ulta’s underlying business will get stronger as the vaccine rollout continues. However, Ulta’s outlook for 2021 predicts another year in which revenue will fall short of 2019 levels. Along with Dillon’s departure after eight years as CEO, and Ulta’s plans to open only 40 new stores in 2021, investors are concerned about Ulta’s growth potential. So far, this mixed guidance has had only a moderately negative impact on the ULTA stock price. Still, due to the risk implied by this uncertainty, shares may be set to pull back a bit more. Possibility Of A Pullback Mixed guidance, and the recent cooling following its hot run from last fall through the start of spring, point to possible lower prices for Ulta Beauty shares. This potential pullback, which could be chalked up to investor impatience, may work in favor of patient investors. As it stands now, Ulta sports a premium valuation, given that its business rebound remains a work in progress. Trading for 33.2x forward earnings, its valuation could see some slight contraction. A 10%-15% pullback, which is toward the low end of analyst estimates, seems plausible in the near-term. That will be true especially if earnings for the current quarter underwhelm as well. Even as the recovery timeline for Ulta remains longer than for other retailers, investors with a longer time horizon may find opportunity here if shares fall back below the $300 per share mark. Analysts Chime In According to TipRanks’ analyst rating consensus, ULTA stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 19 analysts covering the stock, 13 rate it a Buy, 6 analysts rate it a Hold, and 0 analysts rate it a Sell. As for price targets, the average analyst price target on ULTA stock today is $345.33 per share, implying around 6.49% upside potential. Bottom Line The markets were justified in bidding up this stock on vaccine optimism, and the slow crawl back to the old normal points to business as usual for bricks-and-mortar focused retail plays such as Ulta. However, the company is now seeing just a partial recovery. Social distancing and mask orders have not totally decimated the demand for beauty products, but they certainly do not help. Once the U.S. moves beyond these measures, Ulta Beauty can leave last year’s headwinds behind. With this in mind, investor interest could continue to cool as the rebound takes longer than expected. Yet, with the potential for results to hit their high-water mark within the next year or two, investors interested in ULTA stock may find opportunity here, when and if a double-digit pullback occurs.

The New York-based family office meanwhile this month increased its stake in rival Beautycounter and was part of a funding round for fast casual restaurant chain Cava.Mousse Partners is one of the world’s largest and most discrete family offices. It has been run for more than two decades by Charles Heilbronn, half-brother of Alain and Gerard, who are credited with owning equal shares of the London-based luxury empire built on No. 5 perfume, the little black dress and the genius of designer Karl Lagerfeld.Venture CapitalThe public filings are a rare glimpse into an investment firm that manages part of an almost $90 billion fortune. Mousse invests in private equity, real estate and credit, often in the form of venture capital. Since the start of 2020, it has backed communication platform MessageBird, catering company Butler Hospitality and fitness firm Tonal. It also bought a stake in Nature’s Fynd, a food startup producing a protein developed from a volcanic microbe found in Yellowstone National Park.The latest Beautycounter investment was made as Carlyle Group Inc. took a majority stake in the skin-care and cosmetics brand. It valued the company, which sells primarily through the Internet rather than physical locations, at $1 billion.Mousse still controls a stake in Ulta Beauty worth about $150 million. It cut the holding as the shares traded near a record. The Bolingbrook, Illinois-based company’s stock has surged more than 150% since mid-March of 2020.A spokeswoman for Ulta Beauty declined to comment, while Heilbronn didn’t respond to a request for comment through LinkedIn.Mousse employs more than three dozen people in Manhattan, Hong Kong and Beijing. The firm’s recent hires include former investment banking analysts from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Lazard. Suzi Kwon Cohen joined as chief investment officer in 2016 after leading North America private equity for Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund.Winning BetsHeilbronn has helped run things since the start, placing winning bets on other skin-care and cosmetics companies such as Coty Inc., while also taking stakes in hospitality, furniture and pharmaceutical companies.The family office doesn’t disclose how much money is at its disposal, but Chanel distributed more than $2 billion in dividends in the past five years, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Heilbronn has been an Ulta Beauty director for more than two decades, with the family investing in the beauty retailer ahead of its 2007 initial public offering.(Updates with Carlyle as Beautycounter investor in sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2f785cd31afafa161da45a34bfac503203ed64566cb055f0a1bcaa6317f89802

The hire sparked an internal revolt by magazine staffers and the suspension of advertising campaigns by two major advertisers, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA) and Burt’s Bees, a Clorox (NYSE: CLX) brand. What Happened: McCammond is a 27-year-old African American journalist who gained attention for her political reporting at Axios and on-air commentary for MSNBC. In 2019, racially offensive tweets that she made during her college years surfaced. McCammond apologized at the time the tweets were discovered and apologized again when Teen Vogue staffers raised the issue to company executives after the announcement of her hiring earlier this month. The New York Times obtained an internal email from Stan Duncan, the chief people officer at Condé Nast, who told the company, “After speaking with Alexi this morning, we agreed that it was best to part ways, so as to not overshadow the important work happening at Teen Vogue.” Duncan’s email included a statement from McCammond, who said her “past tweets have overshadowed the work I’ve done to highlight the people and issues that I care about.” What Else Happened: The Times noted that while Condé Nast leadership, including Anna Wintour, the chief content officer and global editorial director of Vogue, tried to mitigate the growing dissent against McCammond with multiple meetings. Yet hitherto unknown tweets by McCammond involving homophobic language and a photograph of her dressed like an American Indian woman at a 2011 costume party also emerged. The company was reportedly aware of the anti-Asian tweets, but knew nothing of the other tweets and the photograph. Complicating matters was the decision by advertisers Ulta Beauty and Burt’s Bees to suspend Teen Vogue advertising campaigns as result of the growing furor around McCammond. The Times cited anonymous sources who said Ulta Beauty campaign was a seven-digit figure; it is not certain how much Burt’s Bees campaign was worth, nor is it certain if other advertisers threatened to halt their advertising.
