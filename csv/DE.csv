The company manufactures and distributes equipment used in agriculture, construction, forestry, and turf care. Shares of the company rose 1.3% to close at $359.75 on May 21.



Revenues of $12.06 billion surpassed the Street’s estimates of $10.44 billion and jumped 30% from the year-ago period.



Earnings came in at $5.68 per share, beating the consensus estimates of $4.52 per share. Net sales soared 34% year-over-year.



Deere CEO John C. May said, ""Our smart industrial operating strategy is continuing to have a significant impact on performance while also helping customers do their jobs in a more profitable and sustainable manner.” (See Deere stock analysis on TipRanks)



Following the fiscal Q2 earnings release, Oppenheimer analyst Kristen Owen assigned a Buy rating and a price target of $416 (15.6% upside potential).



Owen commented, “The company saw volume strength across the portfolio, with favorable mix and strong price realization driving margin expansion in each segment.”



He further added, “While noting strong performance YTD, management expressed expectations of increased supply chain pressures throughout the remainder of the fiscal year.”



The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 10 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target stands at $410.23 and implies upside potential of 14% to current levels. Shares have gained 143% over the past year.

Batteries that power everything from cell phones to airplanes.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips These are the kinds of technologies people think about when looking into the future. They don’t think about tractors. 10 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks for Your Reliability Short List But that’s the cool thing about the Roaring 2020s. These breakthroughs touch everything. They create new industries and transform old ones. That’s why I think this decade will bring some of the best opportunities investors ever see. Take the story of a 184-year-old company that began with a new way to plow dirt and is now moving headlong into advanced technology. Companies everywhere must do the same … Autonomous vehicles (AVs) — or self-driving cars — will change the way we get around in ways we haven’t seen since Henry Ford introduced the Model T in 1980. AVs are going to reshape the American landscape. How you vacation, where you live, even the way we design our cities and neighborhoods will change. With this much at stake, many of the world’s smartest, richest, most powerful entrepreneurs, investors and corporations are working day and night to make early and strong entrances into this market that will one day be massive. I have no doubt the winners of this race will see their stocks advance 10-fold … 20-fold … even 100-fold over the coming decade … taking investors along for the ride of their lives. But autonomous driving technology isn’t just for cars. It isn’t even just for busses, or trains, or airplanes. More than 70 years before Henry Ford introduced the Model T, a blacksmith by the name of John Deere saw a broken steel sawmill blade and had an idea. Farmers had to constantly stop working to knock dirt off their cast-iron plows. Deere thought that if the plows were made of polished steel, the dirt would slide off and make farming a whole lot easier. Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) began in 1837 with what was a “high tech” plow at the time, and you know the rest of the story. It grew into one of the world’s biggest companies that manufactures all kinds of equipment for agriculture, construction, lawn care and more. Deere continues to embrace innovation and is now focused on new technology that will reshape the company and its industry. The company itself says it is transforming from a “machinery company” into a “smart technology company.” Investors like what they see. The stock has jumped more than 200% in the last 12 months — which included the pandemic — giving the company a valuation of $120 billion. I got to see some of what Deere is up to a little over a year ago at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. I’m more of a city boy, so I can’t say I’ve done a lot of farming or lawn care in my time, but what I saw was cool. The company is focused on three main areas of innovation … Electric power: The days of tractors growling through the fields and belching smoke into the air are coming to an end. “Electrification is not just about replacing the fuel tank; it’s about replacing the complete engine,” said Martin Kremmer of the John Deere European Technology Center. This results in zero emissions, low maintenance costs and increased efficiency and productivity. Efficiency and productivity will improve even more as next-generation batteries are rolled out. The coming breakthrough battery technology will power all electric vehicles of the future. Deere recognizes its importance … and so do smart investors. That makes now the time to get in position for the biggest profits. Autonomy: Yes, tractors will drive themselves one day. In fact, some believe tractors might get there before cars because they operate in open fields instead of crowded streets. But in this case, autonomy means more than self-driving. For example, Deere is developing autonomous ways to spray crops. One way is through drones, which would house a scanner that identifies weeds and automatically triggers a pesticide spray when needed. (The drones would also rely on battery power.) Artificial intelligence (AI): High-resolution cameras take 20 pictures per second, and using AI, the system “learns” the difference between weeds and crops. It then sprays weed killer where needed instead of blanketing an entire field. That’s better for the environment, more effective for the farmer and cheaper to boot. With this kind of innovation occurring in industry after industry, you can see why I believe the Roaring 2020s will be a decade for the investing record books. Several once-in-a-generation technologies are converging at the same time and transforming virtually every aspect of our lives — from healthcare to instant communication to robotics to electric power and much more. Even an industry like farming, which you could say is as old as dirt, is becoming “smart.” The impact these technologies have on the global economy will one day dwarf the internet. To make money, you want to invest in companies leading the way. And to make the big money, you want to do it soon … while it’s still early.

Melinda Gates, 56, is a former Microsoft manager who’s gained international prominence co-running the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It’s already given away more than $50 billion.They will remain co-chairs and trustees of the foundation, a spokesperson for the organization wrote in an emailed statement.“No changes to their roles or the organization are planned,” according to the statement. “They will continue to work together to shape and approve foundation strategies, advocate for the foundation’s issues, and set the organization’s overall direction.”It’s the second bombshell divorce among the uppermost ranks of the world’s richest people in recent years, following the 2019 separation announcement of Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Scott.That split, which divided the couple’s stake in Amazon.com Inc., immediately made MacKenzie one of the world’s richest people. In the months that followed, she became one of the most influential philanthropists in the world, giving away billions of dollars to often overlooked causes among billionaire donors.The Gates’s wealth could prove more complex to carve up than the Bezos fortune, which was largely concentrated in Amazon stock.Bill Gates’s net worth originated with Microsoft but shares of the software-maker now probably make up less than 20% of his assets. He’s shifted much of his stake into the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation over the years and his exact stake hasn’t been disclosed since he left Microsoft’s board last year.Gates’s biggest asset is Cascade Investment, a holding company he created with the proceeds of Microsoft stock sales and dividends that’s run by Michael Larson. Through Cascade, Gates has interests in real estate, energy and hospitality as well as stakes in dozens of public companies, including Canadian National Railway and Deere & Co.Monica Mazzei, a divorce attorney and a partner at Sideman & Bancroft LLP in San Francisco, said the big question concerning the couple’s foundation and family office is to what extent they plan on working together going forward.“Even in the most amicable divorces I’ve seen, the preference has been to split the foundation in two so that there’s more autonomy and less intermingling,” she said. The same principle applies to family offices, where the investments could be divvied up into two separate pots.Secrecy PossibleThe pair live in Washington, which is a community property state. That means that anything acquired during a marriage is considered equally owned by both partners, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the fortune will be split in half.“It is not a mandatory 50-50,” said Janet George, a family lawyer in Washington with the firm McKinley Irvin. “The courts can award more or less, depending on what is just and equitable.”The state also mandates a 90-day cooling off period from the day a couple initially files for divorce, and the soonest it can be finalized by a judge. A search of King County public records Monday turned up no such filing from Bill and Melinda Gates.George said the public might never find out how they split the fortune, because it can be hidden behind private contracts.It couldn’t be determined if the two signed a pre-nuptial agreement. Their youngest child is 18.Becoming PhilanthropistsThe pair met in New York in the 1980s, early into Melinda’s time at Microsoft.When deciding whether to marry, Bill made a pro-and-con list on a whiteboard -- Melinda related how she walked into his bedroom to find him tabulating various factors in the Netflix documentary series “Inside Bill’s Brain.”The couple’s philanthropy has always been deeply rooted in their relationship and marriage. The day before they wed in Hawaii, Bill’s mother, Mary, who had been trying to convince him to dramatically increase his charity, gave Melinda a letter which closed with the words “From those to whom much is given, much is expected.” Mary Gates died several months later.But it was on a trip to Africa during their engagement that the couple decided they would become serious philanthropists.“We fell in love with everything we saw but it’s really not at all trite to say that we really fell in love with the people,” Melinda said at a Salesforce event in 2016. “It just started us on this series of questions of sort of saying to ourselves, ‘What is going on here?’”Later on in the trip, the couple filled out a marriage questionnaire to make sure they had the same values. That’s when they decided “the vast majority of resources from Microsoft would go back to society,” Melinda said. “It was an easy discussion. We just thought it would be later in our lives when we got to do it.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d44e3a5d7b56e9e04b5145b6db6bc487b6f1c28b964fc97f28d93826fae77c01
