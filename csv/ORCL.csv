Its products include cloud services, operating systems, enterprise software, software development tools, computer hardware, and gaming programs and hardware.



The main value for MSFT comes from its vast, highly technical, and economically valuable intellectual property portfolio as well as the significant switching costs that its business clients face once they are using its systems. The company enjoys particularly strong positions in its operating system, office business units, and cloud computing business segments and is also seeing strong growth across most of its business units. Its Azure cloud platform is seeing the most robust growth, as its revenue was up 50% year-over-year in their most recent quarterly results.



In its most recent quarter, MSFT announced astonishingly strong 39.3% year-over-year earnings-per-share growth, reflecting the strong demand for its competitively positioned products. 



Given its strong brain trust from the top-tier talent it attracts, MSFT should continue to enjoy a strong competitive position for years to come. At the same time, it is unlikely that the company will grow earnings at the same clip as it has in its most recent quarter. MSFT is also enhancing its earnings-per-share growth by repurchasing shares at a steady rate, and has been growing its dividend-per-share at a fast pace every year for the past 19 years. (See Microsoft stock charts on TipRanks)



Valuation Metrics



Despite the company’s remarkable momentum and long-term potential, its valuation appears rather rich. Its forward price to earnings ratio is 34.7x compared to its 5-year average of 26.1x. Furthermore, their enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is 23.1x compared to its 5-year average of 16x.



As a result, while earnings-per-share will likely continue to grow steadily, likely multiple compression back towards historical averages will eat into total returns. Additionally, the dividend yield is currently a paltry 0.8%, so the dividend will not contribute much towards total returns.



Wall Street’s Take



From Wall Street analysts, MSFT earns a Strong Buy analyst consensus based on 27 Buy ratings in the past 3 months. Additionally, the average Microsoft price target of $297.96 puts the upside potential at 6.44%. 







Summary and Conclusions



MSFT is riding significant momentum from its rapidly growing Azure cloud business, while its other business segments continue to generate strong growth as well. Additionally, share buybacks and dividend growth are bolstering shareholder returns and combine with MSFT’s strong competitive advantages, growth, and unanimous Wall Street analyst bullishness to make it appear to be an attractive investment.



That said, based on historical valuation multiples, the stock looks expensive right now and the dividend yield is too low to make a significant contribution to total returns. Furthermore, growth on a per-share basis is highly unlikely to keep up with its most recent quarterly pace. Last but not least, MSFT’s cloud business faces strong competition from fellow tech giants such as Amazon (AMZN), Oracle (ORCL), Google (GOOG), and IBM (IBM).



MSFT certainly has a lot going for it and may be worth an investment right now, but investors should not expect future returns to repeat the stock’s past performance, given its rich valuation.

According to Reuters, the U.S. government will launch a new cloud-computing contract inviting bids from numerous companies, including Amazon and Microsoft.



In November 2019, Microsoft defeated Amazon and won the lucrative Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, or JEDI contract, which was awarded to modernize the Pentagon’s information technology operations over a period of 10 years.



Amazon challenged the Pentagon’s contract to Microsoft, saying that the result of the award process was unfair and was influenced by U.S. President Donald Trump's political bias against Amazon.



In January 2020, Amazon filed a motion to halt the deal between its rival Microsoft and the DOD until the court made a decision on its protest.



Over the next several months, a legal battle ensued between Amazon and the DOD. In April 2020, the regulators said that it could not determine whether the Trump administration influenced the award to Microsoft. A year later, in April 2021, a judge refused to abandon Amazon's claims.



Microsoft and Amazon were not the only companies disputing the contract. In August 2018, Oracle (ORCL) filed a protest after the DOD decided to award the contract to a single company instead of many eligible contenders for the contract.



However, Oracle’s protest was dismissed by the regulators explaining that the single-company award was in the best interest of the government’s national security.



Jefferies analyst Brent Thill recently reiterated a Buy rating and the price target of $4,200 (14.3% upside potential) on the stock.



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 30 Buys. The average Amazon price target of $4,320 implies 17.5% upside potential to current levels.



Amazon scores a “Perfect 10” on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

Independent analysts have tested and confirmed that Oracle MySQL with HeatWave runs 10 to 100 times faster than Amazon's version of MySQL called Aurora. This technological breakthrough is causing several of Amazon's customers to start moving their Aurora workloads to Oracle MySQL. And industry analysts are telling us they are seeing a 10x increase in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customer inquiries. Both the Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle MySQL with HeatWave technology have captured the technology high-ground in the cloud database business-and that bodes well for the future of the Oracle Cloud.”

Wabtec's decision to deploy GM's Ultium battery and HYDROTEC hydrogen fuel cell systems further validates our advanced technology and demonstrates its versatility.”

(ORCL) reported stronger-than-expected results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. However, following the earnings release, shares of the cloud database company plummeted 4.8% in Tuesday’s extended trading session.



Oracle reported quarterly revenues of $11.23 billion, a growth of 8% from the prior year. Also, it surpassed the consensus estimate of $11.04 billion.



The company’s increase in revenues can be attributed primarily to the growth witnessed in its cloud services and license support revenues by 8% year-over-year to $7.4 billion.



Moreover, Oracle reported Q4 adjusted EPS of $1.54, which denoted a growth of 29% year-over-year. The company beat the consensus estimate of $1.31.



Oracle CEO Safra Catz said, ""Our Q4 performance was absolutely outstanding with total revenue beating guidance by nearly $200 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share beating guidance by $0.24. Our multi-billion dollar Fusion and NetSuite cloud applications businesses saw dramatic increases in their already rapid revenue growth rates: Fusion ERP was up 30% in Q3 and up 46% in Q4, Fusion HCM was up 23% in Q3 and up 35% in Q4, NetSuite was up 24% in Q3 and up 26% in Q4. The accelerating growth rates of both our applications and infrastructure cloud businesses this year drove earnings per share growth up to 21% in FY21. That is the fourth consecutive year of double-digit earnings per share growth at Oracle Corporation."" (See Oracle stock analysis on TipRanks)



Recently, Cowen & Co. analyst Derrick Wood reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $85 (4.1% upside potential).



“Our checks are constructive around strength in cloud bookings and we’re expecting a solid quarter. But the bar is lifted as the stock has delivered one of the strongest 3-month performances we’ve seen in a decade,” said Wood.



Consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 2 Buys and 8 Holds. The Oracle average analyst price target stands at $76.10, which implies a potential downside of 6.8% from current levels. Shares have gained 49.5% over the past year.

company,1623747296,Tuesday’s Pre-Market: Here’s What You Need to Know Before the Market Opens,68350826,https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?861007814,ORCL,Nasdaq,"U.S. stock futures were trending higher on Tuesday ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) two-day policy meeting. Notably, investors await data related to the U.S. industrial production, producer prices, and retail sales, to be released today.



Dow futures remain relatively flat, while Nasdaq and S&P futures had gained about 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively, at the time of writing.



Qudian Inc (QD) is expected to report earnings before the market opens, while Anterix (ATEX), Azure Power Global (AZRE), and Oracle (ORCL) are expected to report after the market close.



Torchlight Energy Resources (TRCH) was the most actively traded stock in pre-market trading, with 7.7 million shares having changed hands at the time of writing. Recently, the oil and gas exploration company announced a special dividend of Series A Preferred Stock, which will be issued on a one-for-one basis to common stockholders of record as on June 24, 2021. This special dividend is declared in relation to the previously announced business combination transaction with Metamaterial, Inc., which recently received shareholders’ approval.



Clearside Biomedical (CLSD) was the biggest gainer in pre-market trading as the stock rose 50% at the time of writing. Recently, the biopharmaceutical company came out with positive safety results of Cohort 1 of OASIS. This is the company’s ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial of CLS-AX, which is administered by suprachoroidal injection via Clearside’s SCS Microinjector in six patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD).



Clearside Chief Medical Officer commented, “We are very encouraged by the Cohort 1 results of the OASIS trial and we are immediately beginning Cohort 2 enrollment as planned. The initial data from Cohort 1 clearly achieved our safety and tolerability endpoints. While still early and recognizing there are a limited number of patients, we believe the Cohort 1 data supports our hypothesis that the combination of targeted and compartmentalized suprachoroidal delivery and the potent pan-VEGF attributes of axitinib may facilitate an effective treatment option for patients suffering from wet AMD.”



Document Security Systems (DSS) was the biggest laggard in pre-market trading, as the stock dropped around 40.9% at the time of writing. Recently, the packaging and security printing solutions provider announced the pricing of an underwritten common stock public offering of 29 million shares at a price of $1.50 per share.



The gross proceeds of the offering are likely to be $43.5 million, excluding underwriting discounts and commissions, and other costs. These proceeds are expected to be channeled into growth, development, opportunistic acquisitions, and other general corporate needs.



Notably, the underwriters have been granted a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 15% of shares of common stock offered to cover over-allotments, if any. This option, if exercised in full, is anticipated to enhance the total gross proceeds of the offering to around $50 million.



In M&A news, Accenture (ACN), the global professional services company, has revealed the acquisition of umlaut, an engineering consulting and services firm. The acquisition will strengthen the company’s Industry X capabilities. The terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.



A rise in demand for digital technologies like cloud, artificial intelligence, and 5G was recorded due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the buyout will enable Accenture to meet the growing demand of its clients by offering them enhanced services and helping them to adopt digital techniques in a better and easier way. Furthermore, Accenture’s Industry X design, innovation, and product development capacities will be boosted, and that will help companies address the shift to digitalization.



Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said, “We predicted that digital would ultimately be applied at scale to the core of a company’s business – the design, engineering and manufacturing of their products. And, for nearly a decade Accenture has been building the unique capabilities and ecosystem partnerships to combine the power of digital with traditional engineering services.”



In other news, GE Aviation, a unit of multinational conglomerate General Electric Company (GE), together with Safran, revealed a program named CFM RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines), which targets to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by more than 20%, facilitated by open blade engines.



GE Aviation is a global provider of jet engines, components, and systems for commercial and military aircraft, while Safran is an international high-technology group operating in the aviation (propulsion, equipment, and interiors), defense, and space markets.



Through this program, a range of new and disruptive technologies will be established for future engines, which are expected to enter service by the mid-2030s. Furthermore, the technology developed under RISE will be 100% compatible with alternate energy sources such as Sustainable Aviation Fuels and hydrogen.



GE Aviation CEO John Slattery commented, “Together, through the RISE technology demonstration program, we are reinventing the future of flight, bringing an advanced suite of revolutionary technologies to market that will take the next generation of single-aisle aircraft to a new level of fuel efficiency and reduced emissions.”



Meanwhile, Clean Energy Fuels (CLNE), the provider of renewable natural gas (RNG) for the transportation industry, announced its plans to invest in the development of renewable natural gas (RNG) from dairies and other agricultural facilities. The investments will be made both independently and with partners TotalEnergies (TOT) and BP plc (BP).



Clean Energy CEO Andrew J. Littlefair said, “Clean Energy’s business has pivoted to focus on an extraordinary renewable, non-fossil fuel that can actually reduce fleets’ carbon footprint by as much as 500. The logo, color scheme, messaging, website and other brand elements that we introduced today denote a circular economy, where organic waste is turned into sustainable fuel, and embodies the role Clean Energy plays in helping our planet.”



The global investment bank and financial services holding company Bank of America (BAC) opened its first three financial centers in Kentucky and revealed its plans to add more centers in the future, with a fourth financial center coming in Lexington next year. The opening of three centers in Lexington will offer retail banking, lending and small business services, and investing and personalized financial guidance to local clients.



Bank of America’s regional executive for expansion markets Felicia Lewis said, “Bank of America has been serving clients in Kentucky for over 40 years through Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, lending to and supporting the growth of local businesses, and through active involvement in the communities we serve. Our new financial centers enable us to deliver high-tech, high-touch service and a full range of capabilities that can help to further enhance the financial lives of our clients.”



Moderna, Inc. (MRNA) has submitted an application to Swissmedic for the authorized use of its COVID-19 vaccine in adolescents in Switzerland. Last week, an application for emergency use authorization (EUA) with the FDA was also submitted by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology company to administer the vaccine to adolescents in the United States.



In May, the company announced that the Phase 2/3 TeenCOVE study of its COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) met its primary immunogenicity endpoint in adolescents. The study showed no cases of COVID-19 infection in individuals administered with two doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, using the primary definition. Furthermore, the vaccine represented an efficacy of 93% in seronegative participants 14 days after receiving the first dose, when using the secondary CDC case definition of COVID-19, which tested for the milder disease.



Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel commented, “We are pleased to announce that we have submitted an authorization application for our COVID-19 vaccine with Swissmedic for use in adolescents in Switzerland. We are encouraged that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was highly effective at preventing COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infection in adolescents. We have already filed for authorization with the U.S. FDA, Health Canada and the European Medicines Agency and we will continue to file with regulatory agencies around the world for this important younger age population. We remain focused on helping to end the COVID-19 pandemic.”",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a3bf00bcb3e9d9f27b21a433b77287b5bc941114d60b713603ff9affd9b9ab4b
