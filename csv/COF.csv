The shares fell about 4% in extended trading.Product sales, which make up more than 90% of Snowflake’s revenue, will be $235 million to $240 million in the period ending in July, the San Mateo, California-based company said Wednesday in a statement. That would be a growth rate of as much as 92% over the period a year earlier, the company said, compared with a pace of 110% in the fiscal first quarter, which ended April 30. Analysts, on average, estimated $233 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Total revenue more than doubled to $228.9 million in the fiscal first quarter, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $213.4 million. The company reported its net loss was $203 million, or 70 cents a share, from $93.6 million, or $1.72, a year earlier.“Given there were high expectations into the quarter, the investor base might not be satisfied enough with these results to drive shares higher,” Raimo Lenschow, an analyst at Barclays, wrote in a research note.Snowflake’s software pulls information from multiple systems so clients can analyze it together in one place. The company competes against the cloud-computing divisions of Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc., as well as open-source vendor Cloudera Inc. and database stalwart Oracle Corp. Snowflake has secured major deals with banks, including Capital One Financial Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.After the successful initial public offering in September, shareholders have grown concerned that the company is overvalued.

More information about each potential case can be found at the link provided. XL Fleet Corporation (NYSE: XL) Bragar Eagel & Squire is investigating certain officers and directors of XL Fleet Corp. following a class action complaint that was filed against XL Fleet on March 8, 2021. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that XL Fleet’s salespeople were pressured to inflate their sales pipelines to boost the Company’s reported sales and backlog; (2) that at least 18 of the 33 customers that XL featured were inactive and had not placed an order since 2019; (3) that XL’s technology had been materially overstated and offered only 5% to 10% of fleet savings; (4) that XL lacks the supply chain and engineers to roll out new products on the announced timelines; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Zoom had inadequate data privacy and security measures; (ii) contrary to Zoom’s assertions, the Company’s video communications service was not end-to-end encrypted; (iii) as a result of all the foregoing, users of Zoom’s communications services were at an increased risk of having their personal information accessed by unauthorized parties, including Facebook; (iv) usage of the Company’s video communications services was foreseeably likely to decline when the foregoing facts came to light; and (v) as a result, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Bragar Eagel & Squire is investigating certain officers and directors of Alphabet Inc. following a class action complaint that was filed against Alphabet on April 26, 2019. The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s data security and management integrity. Specifically, defendants learned of a three-year-long software glitch in the Google+ social media network that potentially exposed the private personal data of millions of Google+ users to third-parties, and led to the discovery of other systemic vulnerabilities that further compromised the data security of Google+ users. Defendants knew of these data-security issues in March of 2018, but for months, they continued to stress to investors the importance of data security and simply warned investors about risks related to data-security issues and concerns, while concealing that these risks had already been realized and that defendants had such poor security controls and record keeping that they could not determine the scope of the data breach, identify all of the affected users, detect other data-security bugs, or protect the private personal data of the tens of millions of Google+ users. The Wall Street Journal (“WSJ”) led the exposure of defendants’ scheme, triggering governmental investigations, Congressional hearings, the shutdown of the Google+ social media network, undermined confidence in the integrity of defendants’ data security and management, and damaged investors.

He will oversee a fast-growing team of growth, acquisition, brand and marketing professionals as a member of the leadership team. Dye will be responsible for bringing Metromile’s vision of fairer and real-time insurance to more drivers at a time when consumers increasingly seek pay-per-mile auto insurance and greater flexibility and digital experiences from their insurer. “Having spent more than 20 years at Capital One, Troy stood out as a disciplined, data-driven marketer who balances growth and profitability,” said Metromile Chief Executive Officer Dan Preston. “Troy joins at a critical juncture as we rapidly scale the business in our existing footprint and lay the groundwork to bring Metromile to more than 100 million drivers nationwide. He is a hands-on team leader, strategist and operator, and I am confident he will drive our growth engine forward.” Dye has focused his marketing career transforming brands and marketing machines for large, data-driven and digital personal finance products. He was most recently Managing Vice President and Head of Card Marketing, Engagement and Insights for Capital One’s (NYSE: COF) domestic consumer credit card business. Previously, he held executive roles leading marketing for Capital One’s small business credit card and partnerships divisions and the brand strategy for the U.S. credit card business and the marketing team in Canada. He was also a Practice Manager for the small business practice at Corporate Executive Board, helping Fortune 500 companies effectively market to small business owners. “As a Metromile customer, I have seen firsthand how the company sets itself apart through its personalized experience and impactful savings,” said Dye. “I am thrilled to join Metromile as pay-per-mile auto insurance hits a tipping point, and I look forward to providing drivers a better value proposition and expanding our reach across the country.” Dye also serves on the board of directors of NextUp, a nonprofit organization focused on providing quality after-school programs for middle school students in Richmond, Virginia. He is an alumnus of the University of Virginia and the United States Naval Academy. Metromile will begin expanding nationwide in the second half of 2021. The digital insurance platform’s data from the first three months of 2021 indicates driving is returning to as much as 95% of pre-pandemic levels. Social trends, such as increased remote work and larger suburban and rural communities, point to a new normal with more Americans changing how they get around and becoming low-mileage drivers, looking for new ways to save. About MetromileMetromile (NASDAQ: MILE, MILEW) is a leading digital insurance platform in the United States.

(f/k/a K12, Inc.) (NYSE: LRN), Capital One (NYSE: COF), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) on behalf of long-term stockholders. More information about each potential case can be found at the link provided. Stride, Inc. (f/k/a K12, Inc.) (NYSE: LRN) Bragar Eagel & Squire is investigating certain officers and directors of Stride, Inc. following news that the Shareholder Class Action against Stride has survived the motions to dismiss in the pending securities class action and may face damages. According to the securities class action complaint, during the class period defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose adverse information concerning Merit’s business and prospects. Specifically, defendants failed to disclose that: (a) the integrations of Cianna and Vascular Insights, including their products, sales people, and R&D facilities, had caused operational disruptions and reduced sales and were months behind schedule; (b) sales of acquired company products had slowed substantially due to pre-acquisition pipeline fill, in particular for Vascular Insights products which, as late as July 2019, had zero orders during fiscal 2019; and (c) in light of the foregoing, the Company’s reported financial guidance for fiscal 2019 and 2020 was made without a reasonable basis. As a result of defendants’ material misrepresentations and omissions, Merit stock traded at artificially inflated prices of more than $62 per share. On March 29, 2021, U.S. District Judge David O. Carter denied defendants’ motions to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims, finding that plaintiffs had plausibly alleged securities fraud claims. For more information on our investigation into Merit Medical go to: https://bespc.com/cases/lrn Capital One (NYSE: COF) Bragar Eagel & Squire is investigating certain officers and directors of Capital One following a class action complaint that was filed against Capital One on October 2, 2019. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company did not maintain robust information security protections, and its protection did not shield personal information against security breaches; (2) such deficiencies heightened the Company's exposure to a cyber-attack; and (3) as a result, Capital One's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on our investigation into Capital One go to: https://bespc.com/cases/cof Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Bragar Eagel & Squire is investigating certain officers and directors of Alphabet Inc. following a class action complaint that was filed against Alphabet on April 26, 2019. The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s data security and management integrity. Specifically, defendants learned of a three-year-long software glitch in the Google+ social media network that potentially exposed the private personal data of millions of Google+ users to third-parties, and led to the discovery of other systemic vulnerabilities that further compromised the data security of Google+ users. Defendants knew of these data-security issues in March of 2018, but for months, they continued to stress to investors the importance of data security and simply warned investors about risks related to data-security issues and concerns, while concealing that these risks had already been realized and that defendants had such poor security controls and record keeping that they could not determine the scope of the data breach, identify all of the affected users, detect other data-security bugs, or protect the private personal data of the tens of millions of Google+ users. The Wall Street Journal (“WSJ”) led the exposure of defendants’ scheme, triggering governmental investigations, Congressional hearings, the shutdown of the Google+ social media network, undermined confidence in the integrity of defendants’ data security and management, and damaged investors.

OneStream plans to be ready for a public share sale next year, although actual timing may vary based on market conditions, Chief Financial Officer Bill Koefoed said in an interview. The Rochester, Michigan-based software maker had sales of $130 million in 2019 and hasn’t disclosed more recent revenue. It has been shifting customers to subscriptions that generate a regular sales stream — annual recurring revenue has doubled in the quarter that just ended and totals about $150 million, Koefoed said. The company sells software that helps a CFO’s office report financial information to regulators and investors, as well as manage financial and operational planning. Customers include United Parcel Service Inc., Toyota Motor Corp. and Capital One Financial Corp. It competes with Oracle Corp., SAP SE, Anaplan Inc. and Blackline Inc.The company, which was founded in 2010, is trying to help CFOs have a more up-to-date view of their numbers, moving from an earlier world where figures got tallied once a month to today’s goal of real-time information. The pandemic has made companies realize they can’t rely on planning that’s rapidly obsolete, OneStream Chief Executive Officer Tom Shea said. In the most recent quarter, bookings rose 200%, the company said. “What happened when the pandemic hit is anybody that was running a business realized their plans were pretty much garbage,” Shea said. “You had no idea what demand looked like, you didn't know if someone was going to pay you. The first thing that happened on, let’s call it March 9 of last year, is everybody started to realize that those that had invested in tools and had the information they needed to understand where they were at that moment — they were OK, and those that didn’t realized that they needed to invest.”The company, which KKR took a majority stake in two years ago, plans to use the funds to fuel research and development in the product and its expansion into the Asia Pacific region, Shea said.
