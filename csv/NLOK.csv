The deal is expected to close by the end of this month.



The deal will be beneficial for the prospects of NortonLifeLock, whose market value stands at almost $16 billion. Notably, Avast has a 435 million strong active user base and a market value of $7.2 billion. Therefore, its inclusion will complement NortonLifeLock’s portfolio of 23 million direct customers. (See NortonLifeLock stock chart on TipRanks)



Notably, NortonLifeLock and Avast are both benefiting from an increase in demand for cybersecurity-related products due to the constantly evolving cyber threats. The companies are witnessing strong demand for their solutions, as reflected by their strong customer base. The amalgamation of the two leading players of cybersecurity will not only strengthen offerings from the combined company, but will also boost its competitive position in the industry.



Following the announcement, Barclays analyst Saket Kalia reiterated a Buy rating on NortonLifeLock, while raising the price target to $32 from $31, implying a 18.9% downside potential to current levels.



Kalia raised his outlook on the prospects of NortonLifeLock to account for lower interest expense and other factors.



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 6 Buys and 2 Holds. The average NortonLifeLock price target of $29.29 implies 8.8% upside potential to current levels.

Tepper is not a buyer of NortonLifeLock because it sounds like a great product for protecting you from identity theft, but it is $120 a year and you get more protection for free if you just freeze all three of your credit reports, he said.

It was also announced that shareholders of NortonLifeLock's stock as of February 22, 2021 are entitled to the dividend. The stock is expected to become ex-dividend 1 business day(s) before the record date. NortonLifeLock has an ex-dividend date set for for February 19, 2021. The company's current dividend payout is $0.12, which equates to a dividend yield of 2.31% at current price levels. Understanding Ex-Dividend Dates' Ex-dividend dates signal when company shares cease to trade with their current dividend payouts. There is a small intermission period before companies announce new dividends. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Most ex-dividend dates operate on a quarterly basis. Understanding NortonLifeLock's Dividend History Over the past year, NortonLifeLock has experienced no change regarding its dividend payouts and a downward trend regarding its yields. Last year on February 21, 2020 the company's payout was $0.12, which has returned to its value today. NortonLifeLock's dividend yield last year was 2.83%, which has since decreased by 0.52%. Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market. To read more about NortonLifeLock click here.

NortonLifeLock also posted a total of $639.00 million in sales, a 2.08% increase since Q2. In Q2, NortonLifeLock earned $230.00 million, and total sales reached $626.00 million. What Is ROCE? Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in NortonLifeLock's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q3, NortonLifeLock posted an ROCE of -0.57%. It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future. View more earnings on NLOK ROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows NortonLifeLock is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth. In NortonLifeLock's case, the ROCE ratio shows the amount of assets may not be helping the company achieve higher returns. Investors may take this into account before making any long-term financial decisions. Q3 Earnings Recap NortonLifeLock reported Q3 earnings per share at $0.38/share, which beat analyst predictions of $0.37/share.
