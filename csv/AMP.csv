The deal also will give Bank of Montrealâs North American wealth management clients access to a range of Columbia Threadneedle products.White, who took the reins of Canadaâs fourth-largest lender in 2017, said in January that BMO was looking to âharvest investmentsâ in businesses where the returns werenât good enough or where the bank didnât see a path to a leadership position, and then redeploy that capital toward better opportunities. Increased competition on fees and a shift to passively managed investments have hampered profitability in the fund industry, prompting banks including Societe Generale SA and Wells Fargo & Co. to sell their asset-management operations.Bloomberg News reported in October that BMO was exploring options for its asset-management operations, including seeking a buyer for parts of the business outside its home market.The unit Bank of Montreal is selling consists mostly of the F&C Asset Management Plc business, which the lender bought for about C$1.3 billion ($1 billion) in 2014, Gabriel Dechaine, an analyst at National Bank of Canada, said in a note to clients. That acquisition, which predated Whiteâs tenure as CEO, was a âquestionableâ deal and a âhead scratcher at the time it was announced,â so reversing it is a positive move, Dechaine said.Bank of Montreal said the deal wonât have a âsignificantâ effect on its future earnings run rate but will improve its efficiency ratio, return on equity and common equity tier 1 capital ratio. The sale price is about 0.7% of the unitâs assets under management, which Dechaine said was âon the low side,â reflecting the divisionâs low profitability.âA material boost to BMOâs capital ratios in exchange for a small hit to profits is a good trade-off, especially if BMO can redeploy the proceeds more efficiently down the road,â said Dechaine, who rates Bank of Montreal the equivalent of a buy.Bank of Montreal was little changed at C$114.97 at 9:52 a.m. in Toronto, while Minneapolis-based Ameriprise rose 0.2% to $241.15 in New York.Ameriprise said in a separate statement that the deal, expected to close in the fourth quarter, will give it an additional $124 billion of assets under management in Europe, bringing its total AUM to more than $1.2 trillion. The acquisition will accelerate Ameripriseâs strategy of growing its fee-based businesses and boost the overall contribution from wealth and asset management, the company said.Bank of Montreal has weathered the Covid-19 crisis with strong results from its capital-markets unit, which has benefited from a surge in volatility and trading. And while increased provisions to protect against the possibility of rising defaults have weighed on overall earnings, the lenderâs North American personal and commercial banking business has been helped by rising deposits and shrinking costs.(Updates with analystâs comments, shares starting in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0d88f7e8e3e270aff6a169d90696c66cccc31de268e05f17685776c088e5a67a
