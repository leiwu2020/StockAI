First round offers may be due as soon as later this month, the people said.American Tower Corp. is also among the potential bidders, the people said. A group known as Symphony Consortium, consisting of local telecom operator Stilmark Holdings Pty with U.S. provider ATN International Inc. and Canadian pension investor OMERS Infrastructure Management Inc. said in November it plans to participate in the sale.Deliberations are ongoing and the prospective suitors could decide not to proceed with offers, the people said. Representatives for American Tower, Brookfield, IFM and Singtel declined to comment. A representative for Symphony Consortium did not respond to requests for comment.The potential sale comes amid a series of sizable telecommunication towers deals in recent months. Spain’s Cellnex Telecom SA agreed in November to buy CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd.’s European telecommunication towers for about $12 billion, while American Tower inked a deal in January to buy a portfolio of towers in Europe and South America from a unit of Telefonica SA for about $9.4 billion.Telstra Corp., Optus’s main rival in the Australian telecommunications market, said in March that plans to sell a stake in its own towers arm were on track, and that binding offers would be due in the second quarter of 2022.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=852057f79ae9a6c6732db90bb07e611ca3a9716c280701857134477addec3c81

Analysts are specialists within banking and financial systems that typically report for specific stocks or within defined sectors. These people research company financial statements, sit in conference calls and meetings, and speak with relevant insiders to determine what are known as analyst ratings for stocks. Typically, analysts will rate each stock once a quarter. Analysts also give out recommendations like ""buy"", ""sell"", ""hold"", or similar verbage for each stock based on their overall evaluations of the corres ponding company. A ""buy"" indicates that an analyst is optimistic about a stock's short-term or mid-term growth, recommending traders to purchase the stock. Contrastingly, a ""sell"" means that an analyst believes the stock will trend downwards in that same time frame. A ""hold"" suggests that investors should not buy more of or sell any of the specified stock due to that analyst's prediction of stagnation. Some analysts publish their predictions for metrics such as growth estimates, earnings, and revenue to provide additional guidance with their ratings. When using analyst ratings, it is important to keep in mind that stock and sector analysts are also human and are only offering their opinions to investors.
