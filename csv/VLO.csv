While outages dipped slightly in North Carolina and South Carolina, more than half of each state’s stations are still without gasoline.“Too many stations need fuel, not enough capacity at the rack, not enough truck drivers,” said Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, on Twitter. “Most of these states with outages have continued to see panicked buying, which is likely a contributing factor to the slowish recovery thus far. It will take a few weeks.”Colonial Pipeline Co. paid nearly $5 million to Eastern European hackers to end a ransomware attack that shut its network of pipelines that transport gasoline, diesel and jet fuel along the U.S. East Coast. The outage, which occurred just weeks before the kickoff of summer driving season, left some retail stations dry in more than 10 states and pushed the average national pump price above $3 a gallon for the first time in six years.One of North America’s biggest distributors said the shortages will drag on because of the lack of tanker trucks to haul supplies.“It’s really going to be probably seven to 10 days before the average consumer really notices a noticeable improvement” in local supplies, said Andy Milton, senior vice president of supply at Mansfield Energy Corp., whose closely held company handles more than 3 billion gallons of fuel a year across the U.S and Canada.Mansfield has brought trucks to areas affected by shortages from as far away as Minnesota and Texas. “The truck itself becomes the major, the major problem,” Milton said.Many truck drivers stopped hauling fuel during the pandemic when gasoline demand collapsed. Now, companies are rushing to hire them back. As recently as last week, Pilot Corp. was offering $5,000 hiring bonuses for tanker drivers to supply its stores and said it could hire 200 people before summer.The deadly winter storm that paralyzed Texas in February followed by Colonial’s shutdown have been back-to-back crises for Mansfield’s network.“I keep hoping there’s not a hurricane around the corner,” said Milton. “That might lead me to change my career at that point.”As of Thursday, the origin of Colonial’s system in the South was running at less than half of capacity, according to people familiar with the matter. Fuel traders have been paying each other extra to gain access to the pipeline, the first time that’s happened since before the pandemic.To help alleviate the crisis, the Biden administration granted two Jones Act waivers to companies including Valero Energy Corp. that allow foreign tankers to send fuel to the U.S. East Coast.Since Colonial resumed operations, a gasoline tanker hailing from France which had been diverted toward the U.S. Atlantic Coast has now changed course back toward the Gulf Coast. On Thursday, a European tanker that was en route to the Bahamas arrived in Savannah, Georgia to unload diesel.(Updates with latest fuel station outages in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=53f33239d63d0218c1fa83c582868ca886ef911246d36ef0c4f281aae900e645

The Homeland Security Department did not provide any details about the recipient of the new waiver or how long it would be valid.“This decision was made after careful consideration and consultation with interagency partners across the federal government as part of the whole-of-government response President Biden directed to address the impacts of the Colonial Pipeline shutdown,” the agency said in a statement.A previous waiver was provided to Valero Energy Corp., according to two people familiar with the matter.President Joe Biden said earlier Thursday he was moving “to use every possible means to accelerate fuel deliveries,” and that could include more exemptions. “We’ll grant additional waivers if necessary,” he said during midday remarks at the White House.What the Jones Act Has to Do With Your Car’s Gas Tank: QuickTakeThe waivers are designed to address fuel shortages spurred by the cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline Co., which shut down a major artery for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel along the U.S. East Coast. Even with shipments having resumed Wednesday evening, it could take time for the network to return to normal.Waiving the Jones Act allows foreign-flagged tankers to fill the supply gap. A typical tanker could carry about 300,000 barrels (12.6 million gallons) of fuel from the Gulf Coast to New York Harbor in about six to seven days.Valero didn’t comment on its waiver, but the refiner released a statement saying it’s “working with the government to help supply fuel for those areas impacted by the pipeline outage.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=67628a203f1b5e5cc6e79f363bf11de77b1a002f83c1d4f53ac0cf81861ffabc

A White House official later said the exemption applied to one tanker but other waiver requests were under consideration.“We’ll grant additional waivers if necessary,” President Joe Biden said in remarks at the White House.The move is designed to address fuel shortages spurred by the cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline, which shut down a major artery for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel across the U.S. East Coast. Even with shipments resuming Wednesday evening, it’s unclear how long it will take for the network to return to normal.Valero didn’t comment on the waiver but released a statement that said it’s “working with the government to help supply fuel for those areas impacted by the pipeline outage.”Gasoline stations from Florida to Virginia ran dry after Colonial Pipeline Co. was forced to take systems offline late last week, and pump prices soared above $3 a gallon for the first time in six years.“This waiver will enable the transport of additional gas and jet fuel between the Gulf Coast and East Coast ports to ease supply constraints,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement.What the Jones Act Has to Do With Your Car’s Gas Tank: QuickTakeWhile the government has temporarily lifted U.S. shipping requirements to combat fuel shortages after major storms, the issue is politically fraught. The Jones Act is championed by some of the nation’s biggest shipbuilders and vessel operators, as well as their allies on Capitol Hill. It also has the backing of a key Biden constituency in organized labor, including the Seafarers International Union.The American Maritime Partnership, a group that represents U.S.-flagged ship owners and has opposed efforts to scale back Jones Act protections, said it didn’t object to “the targeted approach of the administration.”But, Mike Roberts, the group’s president said in a statement, that it “strenuously encourages all policy makers to hold accountable those who seek to benefit from any waiver to avoid undermining American jobs and consumers.”Waiving the requirements allows foreign-flagged tankers to fill the supply gap left by the interruption to the pipeline. It would take an estimated six to seven days for a tanker to carry fuel from the Gulf Coast to New York Harbor. By contrast, a shipment of fuel from Europe could arrive in 10 to 14 days. A single cargo delivery into the East Coast is usually about 300,000 barrels (12.6 million gallons).“We believe widespread panic buying, coupled with the one- to two-week time frame for fuel to reach delivery points along the pipeline created an opening for a non-U.S. tanker,” Height Capital Markets analyst Josh Price said in a research note for clients.Read more: Biggest U.S. Gasoline Pipeline Restarts After CyberattackUnder federal law, the U.S. could waive Jones Act shipping requirements if “necessary in the interest of national defense.” However, first, the Maritime Administration “would have to determine that qualified U.S.-flag vessels cannot meet the need,” said Charlie Papavizas, an expert in Jones Act law at Winston & Strawn LLP.The Maritime Administration completed a survey of available Jones Act-compliant tankers on Tuesday, though the results have not been made public.(Updates with detail on waiver recipient from first paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d28a16e438df2896547daa476cb4cc3e56c946b79952b929c718f70a8fb3a415

The largest of the tankers has the capacity to hold 1 million barrels of refined product, they said.The charters come as the outage on the Colonial Pipeline Co. system, which transports about 2.5 million barrels to the East Coast, enters its fourth day. Gas stations from Alabama to Virginia have reported gasoline shortages. Meanwhile, several refiners have rushed to secure ships to store their excess gasoline and diesel production to avoid taking the potentially expensive step of shutting operations until Colonial restarts, according to the people.Before Colonial was attacked by hackers, America’s refiners were ratcheting up their operations to meet an expected spike in demand this summer as newly vaccinated Americans resume major travel. Onshore inventory in the Gulf Coast has already been filling up with their rising fuel production, making the need to find storage after the pipeline hack even more pressing. Filling stations are running dry in the U.S. South as the outage leave limited options for getting fuel to market.Valero and Phillips 66 didn’t respond to emails seeking comment. “We are leveraging our logistics network and commercial relationships as we work to keep our customers supplied with fuel” as market conditions associated with the Colonial shutdown evolve, Marathon spokesman Jamal Kheiry said in an email.The tankers booked so far include Energy Centurion, Khawr Aladid, Ayse C and Nave Titan, they said.Some U.S. refiners have begun curtailing operations. Total SE’s Port Arthur refinery in Texas shut its sole FCC over the weekend, while Citgo Petroleum Corp cut rates at its Lake Charles, Louisiana, refinery. Meanwhile, Danish oil product tanker company Torm said four long-range 2 tankers were booked this week to take refined fuels to the U.S. Atlantic Coast from Europe.Colonial has said it expects to substantially restore service by the end of the week. On Monday, the company manually restored operations on one segment, Line 4, while existing inventory was available.Any cargoes sent to the four foreign-flagged tankers would likely be shipped outside the U.S., even after Colonial returns, the people said. The Jones Act requires that only U.S.-flagged ships transport goods form American port to another.(Updates with carrying capacity of the 4 ships in second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7445085ca119a78b093a72ef9f10f4e0edf2614f0c3e955ed5f5f11cbea71199

company,1620236886,Pent-Up U.S. Travel Demand Poised to Trigger 30% Surge in Jet-Fuel Use,67604615,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JOcE96ZeskEm1RP3Ajyczg--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/a7e58028e469ae1f79b008b92a2f6d45,VLO,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s the postponed weddings and family reunions. It’s meeting newborn grandchildren and attending memorial services for loved ones lost to the pandemic. It’s the rebooked trips to Maui and adventures in new cities.All that travel demand has been piling up for more than a year, and now it’s about to burst out into one hot summer for U.S. domestic flights -- and the jet fuel producers hammered by 2020’s lockdowns.Jet fuel use is expected to jump 30% this summer from where it was in the first quarter, the government projects. The extra demand comes as airlines revamp routes to offer more nonstop flights and boost capacity to reach more leisure destinations like beaches in Florida and national parks in the West. Executives from Hawaiian Airlines, Boeing Co. and U.S. oil refiner Valero Energy Corp. are all looking at the explosion of pent-up demand as an “inflection point.” United Airlines is adding hundreds of flights, and in June will fly its largest schedule since the pandemic hit.With travelers switching on the spending, it’ll be a boon to reopening economies as money pours into restaurants, hotels, rental cars and attractions. But the big question is: What kind of staying power will the summer crescendo have? To truly get things moving again, the domestic leisure trips will need to turn into a recovery for business and international flights, the real money makers for airlines and the crude refiners who produce jet fuel.For many Americans, their first flights in the pandemic era will serve as a litmus test for future travel. If the summer trips go well -- and there’s no accompanying spike in Covid infections -- the real surprise could be that demand stays at elevated levels into the fall and beyond as consumers clamor for a return to normal life.Lindsay Crosby, a 36-year-old commercial banker and morning radio show host, is flying with his wife and two kids from Atlanta to Dallas in late June. It’ll be their first trip since the pandemic started, and he’s feeling confident because not only are he and his wife vaccinated, but so are the other family members he’ll be reuniting with in Texas.“It was $1,000 to fly four of us to Texas and back, but I have the money to spend. I didn’t take any vacations last year, so we have no problem spending the money so I don’t have to be behind the wheel for 12 hours,” he said.“Knowing that this is going to be a normal summer has been very, very much needed -- like for our mental health.”Airline passenger numbers in the U.S. have already grown steadily from the pandemic lows, with a fast acceleration in recent weeks. At first the demand rebound just meant that planes were filling up again, but now additional flights are being added to schedules. U.S. departures in March were being added at a rate of dozens of flights per day, including large gains in Denver and Las Vegas, according to the latest data compiled by BloombergNEF.The added travel means signs of life are appearing in the market for jet fuel, the corner of the oil market that’s so far had the slowest recovery. If jet fuel can come back to even close to normal levels, it will give crude prices more room to surge, further fanning global inflation prospects.Soybean Oil and Crude Lead Best-in-a-Decade Commodities ReboundIn the third quarter, jet fuel demand is projected to reach 1.47 million barrels a day, up from 1.13 million in the first quarter and more than 50% higher than a year earlier, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. U.S. airlines in March used 33% more fuel than in February, reaching the highest monthly consumption level since March 2020, U.S. Department of Transportation figures showed Wednesday. Jet fuel for pipeline loading outside Houston to serve major airports like Atlanta’s and New York’s has been trading about 20 cents a gallon below Nymex diesel futures since mid-April. A year ago, the discount was closer to 30 cents. Still, there’s a long road to a full recovery: In April 2019, the figure was about 8 cents.Even the small recovery for prices is helping to boost profits for the refiners who turn crude oil into fuel products. Jet fuel in April provided 7% of U.S. refinery margins, BloombergNEF data show. That’s up from 3% at the start of the pandemic, but still down from 10% in April 2019.“We’re getting to an inflection point where now they’re starting to add flights,” Valero Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer Gary Simmons told analysts in April. “You can see that in jet fuel nominations and also the fact that airlines are calling their pilots and their crews back.”The big wildcard for both the airlines and the fuel market: What happens after the Labor Day holiday? That’s when many U.S. schools reopen and airline traffic becomes much more dependent on business demand.While domestic leisure traffic is nearly back to 2019 levels for many airlines, U.S. business traffic remains nearly 80% below pre-pandemic levels, holding back a broader rebound. At United Airlines Holdings Inc., for example, even with the added flights for June, the company will still be at just 67% of its domestic schedule compared with June 2019.Airlines could get squeezed if that trend continues. Leisure-goers usually pay for cheaper seats, while business travelers are the big-money ticket buyers. Accelerating vacation demand would likely mean a continued recovery for jet fuel, raising airline costs without margins getting beefed up from the higher fares.Already, the average gallon of jet fuel has increased 23% since late January to $1.79 a gallon on April 28, according to the Argus U.S. Jet Fuel Index.A lack of “higher-quality traffic,” as Airlines for America, the carriers’ trade group puts it, will cause the industry’s financial recovery to lag as average fares remain 29% below pre-pandemic levels. The group predicts that total passenger volumes won’t return to those of 2019 until 2023.Energy industry consultant FGE has a similar outlook for jet fuel demand, forecasting that it won’t return to 2019 levels until 2024. That estimate is also factoring in that airlines are replacing old jets with fuel-efficient models, said Krista Kuhl, a Houston-based oil consultant with FGE.Other thorns for the industry: Jet fuel inventories have built up in the past year, and global travel isn’t recovering at the same pace as U.S. domestic demand.That will make it hard for the Gulf Coast refining industry “to export as much jet as it did in the past,” said Robert Campbell, head of oil products research at Energy Aspects.But the U.S. jet fuel market is about 80% dependent on domestic demand, Simmons of Valero estimates. So even if exports lag for some time, the industry can see a healthy recovery as long as Americans keep flying.And there’s at least some anecdotal evidence that if travelers feel comfortable on their first flights back, they’ll keep taking more.Crosby, the commercial banker who’s flying to Dallas, said he expects he’ll feel safe at the airport and on the plane, but he’ll also be on alert: “Because you always see horror stories about people flying right now who don’t want to wear their mask or refuse to leave it on,” he said. Still, he’s already thinking about more flights, including a fall trip to see his sister in Washington D.C., and his wife has her sights on a vacation in Mexico in September.“I’m actually making plans to travel and go somewhere. I can go buy concert tickets. I bought sporting event tickets, and it’s like ‘Okay, we’re getting back to life now,’” he said.(Adds March fuel use in 12th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=aa03aa6eea964ea32a9c95e4ca70b69a7cb0a3b353e69eed133ba8c7aead7eae

U.S. gasoline demand is improving, while jobless claims fell to the lowest since the pandemic began. Casting a cloud over the prospects for a global recovery, India -- the third-largest oil importer -- posted the world’s largest one-day jump in coronavirus cases.“Demand is not outstripping expectations at this point,” said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “Until we get reopened, and travel and activity really picks up again, that leaves the market in a betwixt and between spot.”It’s an increasingly complex global demand picture for the market to get a handle on. Japanese Prime minister Yoshihide Suga recommended placing Tokyo and other cities under a state of emergency months before the capital hosts the Olympics. Conversely, there is a much more optimistic outlook in the U.S. Refining margins have significantly improved there with gasoline demand at 93% of pre-pandemic levels and diesel fully recovered, Valero Energy Corp. Chief Executive Officer Joe Gorder said in a conference call with analysts.“We’re pretty bullish on gasoline going forward,” Valero Chief Commercial Officer Gary Simmons said on the same call. “As people return to a normal-style life, we’re seeing that people are driving more and kind of avoiding mass transit for the summer season.”Many regions are moving forwarding with plans to open up. Among them, France will lift curbs on regional movement and reopen schools in the coming weeks, and Greece will ease most lockdown measures in May before welcoming back tourists. California, which plans to fully reopen the economy on June 15, has quickened its pace of oil imports from Latin America and raised refinery run rates in advance of an expected summer rebound.The U.K. is also showing signs of a robust recovery. U.K. government data shows average road fuel sales last Friday topped pre-pandemic levels for the first time since September.On the supply side, the OPEC+ coalition is set to start returning more barrels to the market next month. Traders are also watching for a potential relaxation of American sanctions on Iran, though the U.S. has talked down the prospect of an imminent deal.“Oil markets are likely to be stuck in a holding pattern until next week’s OPEC+ supply decision is announced,” said Ryan Fitzmaurice, commodities strategist at Rabobank. It is likely for “more range-bound trade to take place until the market gets more clarity on both the supply and demand front as we approach the all-important summer driving season.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=93a986b88b770367ebd2a0096e96382b4635140590af727cdfb5e9bbd6ed7008
