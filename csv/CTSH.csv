company,1617024998,Analyzing Cognizant Tech Solns's Unusual Options Activity,66371081,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,CTSH,Yahoo,"On Monday, shares of Cognizant Tech Solns (NASDAQ:CTSH) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved down to $79.24. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-04-16 Strike Price: $80.00 Volume: 323 Open Interest: 1908 Three Ways Options Activity Is â€˜Unusual' One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being ""out of the money"". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

London-based Contino, which was acquired by Cognizant in 2019, focuses on helping clients fast-track their transition to become digital businesses with enterprise DevOps methodologies, a cloud-native development approach, and innovative data platforms.The acquisition marks Cognizant's ninth acquisition in 2020 to enhance its AI, cloud, digital engineering, and IoT offerings. The digital and IT services company has invested more than $1.1 billion in 2020 for acquisitions.""We are pleased to welcome Inawisdom's skilled team to Cognizant and further accelerate our innovation on data modernization and intelligent decision-making. Cognizant and Inawisdom's clients will benefit from our shared, deep relationships with AWS and our combined expertise with AI, machine learning, cloud, and data analytics."" said Malcolm Frank, President of Cognizant.Cognizant shares have gained 30% year-to-date. Last week, Wells Fargo analystÂ Timothy WilliÂ resumed coverage of the stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $92. This target implies that investors could be yielding a 14% gain over the coming 12 months.Willi believes efforts by the new management team to refocus Cognizant and rebuild a culture of accountability are beginning to show signs of progress and momentum that should accelerate from this point. (See CTSH stock analysis on TipRanks)While not a pure play on digital, Willi says the company has a sizeable presence and solid platform to capitalize on the sizeable opportunity to help companies continue their digital transformation journeys, and believes Cognizant is a ""soft turnaround"" story that is well underway.From the rest of the Street, the stock scores a cautiously optimistic analyst consensus of a Moderate Buy based on 8 Buys, 4 Holds, and 2 Sells. The average analystÂ price target of $80.46Â implies that the stock is fully priced at current levels.Related News:Scorpio Bulkers To Exit Dry Bulk Sector In 2021; Street Is BullishThoma Bravo To Buy RealPage For $9.6B â€“ ReportRoyal Dutch Shell To Divest Queensland Stake For $2.5B; Street Sees 12% Upside",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=38528c6ed1f98fb5bd672a6b1a4d200e35a640723eefa760efc229819cd80ad2
