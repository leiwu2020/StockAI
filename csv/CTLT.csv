What Happened: The FDA warned that the emergence of new variants or other COVID-19 challenges could prevent it from conducting in-person inspections. In the base-case scenario, FDA will work on mission-critical and priority domestic inspections for the next few months before resuming standard operations in July. If that happens, FDA expects to have cleared 26% of its backlog of medical products inspections by October. The agency continued doing mission-critical inspections, carrying out eight device-related assessments and more than 800 in total from March 2020 to March 2021. In July, FDA resumed prioritized domestic inspections and has since conducted 72 device assessments. The activity has failed to prevent the build of a backlog of inspections. FDA has delayed seven device application decisions solely due to pending inspections or facility assessments. As of March, FDA was yet to do 12 of the for-cause device inspections it plans to complete this fiscal year, which runs to the end of September. In the base-case scenario, FDA will resume standard operations in July. The change will enable FDA to start chipping away at the backlog of 2,002 domestic surveillance inspections at its device unit, which also has a backlog of 424 foreign site visits. The device department has a bigger backlog than the rest of the FDA’s human and animal medical products and tobacco groups combined. Including the device backlog, but not its food work, FDA has 3,229 domestic surveillance inspections remaining. Why It Matters: Even if standard operations resume this month, FDA only expects to complete half of the domestic surveillance inspections in the current financial year under the report’s best-case scenario. While there was a worst-case scenario outlined in the report, the agency did not offer any specific figure for how many inspections would be completed. The FDA will continue to use remote assessment tools when possible but needs to be on-site for many outstanding inspections. Notably, the annual Mammography Quality Standards Act mandates that inspections account for 25% of the remaining domestic assessments. FDA needs to visit sites in-person to perform those inspections.

The HCTS site comes equipped with existing cleanroom infrastructure, process development, quality control laboratories, and warehouse space and will be equipped to provide pDNA manufacturing up to a 500-liter scale, Catalent said.

Catalent helps Moderna fill its vaccine in vials for shipment. This new deal builds on Catalent’s agreement from last June to help produce Moderna’s vaccine. Catalent is dedicating a high-speed production line at its Indiana plant to do fill-finish as part of the expansion. According to Wall Street Journal, Catalent has reached an agreement with Moderna to nearly double the vaccine output at Catalent’s Bloomington plant this month to about 400 vials a minute. New doses will be ready for shipping starting next month, and the upgraded plant will be able to fill an additional 80 million vials a year. The expansion will help Moderna reach its goal of supplying an additional 100 million doses to the U.S. by the end of May and another 100 million doses by the end of July. Moderna declined to comment to WSJ. Last month, Catalent said it would expand the production of Johnson & Johnson’s (NYSE: JNJ) COVID-19 shot at its plant in Italy. With the production upgrades, Catalent expects to potentially manufacture about one billion doses of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine annually through 2023. Price Action: MRNA shares are up 1.1% at $131.35 in the premarket on the last check Tuesday, while CTLT shares closed 0.8% lower at $105.75 on Monday.

company,1616566414,J&J COVID-19 Vaccine To Get Supply Boost As Manufacturing Partner Secures Key FDA Clearance,66533707,,CTLT,Yahoo,"Johnson & Johnson’s (NYSE: JNJ) COVID-19 vaccine is expected to get a significant supply boost after manufacturing partner Catalent Inc (NYSE: CTLT) secured a key U.S. regulator clearance, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday. What Happened: A U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s emergency-use clearance received Tuesday will allow Catalent's facility in Bloomington, Indiana, to manufacture and ship millions of doses helping boost the vaccination supply. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday said the U.S. is allocating 27 million doses across all channels this week, of which 4 million will be from Johnson & Johnson. Two-thirds of the 27 million doses will be going to states and jurisdictions, and the rest will go to other channels, primarily the pharmacy program. Catalent’s facility in Bloomington is expected to contribute most of the supply, according to Bloomberg, which added that J&J will deliver 200 doses of which 100 million are expected to be available by the end of May, a month earlier than the drugmaker’s previous target. The second batch is expected later in the year. Why It Matters: J&J has previously said it aims to provide 20 million U.S. doses of its single-shot vaccine to Americans by the end of March. As of March 22, only 4.25 million J&J doses had been delivered, and of those, 2.4 million have been administered, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. So far, only 82.7 million people have received at least one dose of the vaccine, which is about one-fourth of the U.S. population. Price Action: Shares of Catalent closed 2.2% lower at $107.40 on Tuesday and those of J&J were flat at $160.35.
