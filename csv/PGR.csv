Delivers Mixed Q2 Results; Shares Fall,69196778,https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?1030550197,PGR,Nasdaq,"Shares of Progressive Corp. (PGR) fell 2.57% after the insurance company reported mixed second-quarter results. In Q2, earnings per share came in at $1.34 per share, better than the $1.08 per share expected by analysts. However, it was a 56% decline from earnings per share of $3.04 reported in the same period last year.



Q2 revenue, on the other hand, came in at $11.48 billion, missing consensus estimates of $11.52 billion but up 13% year-over-year. (See Progressive Corp. stock charts on TipRanks)



For June, EPS came in at $0.22, a 72% decline from $0.80 reported the same month last year. However, revenue was up year-over-year to $3.6 billion from $3.2 billion reported the same month last year.



Yesterday Wells Fargo analyst Elyse Greenspan reiterated a Sell rating on the stock and lowered her price target to $87 from $90, implying 8.37% downside potential to current levels. The price cut comes on the back of the insurance company missing estimates.



Operating EPS for the month (June) came in at $0.06, missing the analyst’s estimate of $0.38. Additionally, premiums in the month rose 13.3%, much lower than 15.2% expected. Consequently, the firm has lowered its 2021 EPS estimate to $4 from $5.14, reflecting the June earning miss and higher underlying loss ratios.



“We have an Underweight rating on the shares. As Covid-19 vaccines are rolled out and driving picks up frequency should revert back to more normalized levels, causing margin compression for PGR in 2021. Further, PGR's policy growth should slow as there is less shopping in the market as virtually no players are pushing for rate due to the extremely low level of losses seen in 2020,” Greenspan said.



Consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 3 Buys, 2 Holds, and 2 Sells. The average Progressive Corp. price target of $107.50 implies 13.22% upside potential to current levels.



PGR scores a 3 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, suggesting that the stock is likely to underperform market averages.

However, shares of the insurance company closed 2.4% lower on Wednesday as a sequential decline in profit didn't sit well with the investors. Progressive’s (PGR) Feb. earnings per share surged about 444% to $0.60 year-on-year. However, it decreased by 36.8% from $0.95 in Jan. Net premiums written climbed 13% to $3.9 billion year-over-year, while net premiums earned increased 10% to $3.2 billion. Its combined ratio (percentage of premiums paid out as claims and expenses) increased 110 basis points to 91.4 in Feb. from 90.3 in the prior-year period. (See Progressive stock analysis on TipRanks) Progressive’s overall policies-in-force increased 10% in Feb. to 25.2 million from 22.8 million in the year-ago period. The company recorded year-over-year growth across all its policy lines. Its policies-in-force for Personal Lines, Commercial Lines and Property Business increased 10%, 10% and 13%, respectively. Following the announcement, Wells Fargo analyst Elyse Greenspan reiterated a Sell rating and price target of $90 (1.2% downside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, Greenspan wrote, “We are seeing rate declines in the personal auto sector and the level of rate should slow as the industry factors in the Covid-19 favorable frequency levels. Further, as miles driven rebound from Covid-19 lows the favorable frequency trends should subside even further from here.” Overall, consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 2 Holds, 2 Buys and 3 Sells. The average analyst price target of $96 implies upside potential of about 5.4% from current levels. Shares have gained around 24.8% over the past year.

And while it appears wild price swings are fading, Reddit traders are making a run at other shorted stocks. That means we haven’t seen the last of such events. For those who don’t know, short selling is a trading strategy where investors speculate on a particular stock’s expected price decline. The short interest indicates the total number of shorted shares that haven’t been covered or closed out.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 9 Cheap Stocks That Look Like a Bargain Typically, a high short interest percentage points to investor pessimism. If that percentage exceeds 30%, a sizeable proportion of investors feel that the shares will go down in value. In GameStop’s case, Reddit’s army of retail investors bought GME stock to move the stock price higher, forcing traders that had bet on the price to fall to buy more shares at higher prices to limit their losses. That, of course, sends the stock price up some more. Though short squeeze events have happened in the past, the Reddit squeeze of GameStop was unique in its length and circumstances. Let’s look at three of the most shorted stocks of the year so far: Root Insurance (NASDAQ:ROOT) Rocket Companies (NYSE:RKT) Tanger Factory Outlet Centers (NYSE:SKT) Shorted Stocks: Root Insurance (ROOT) Source: Jirsak / Shutterstock.com Shares of technology-based car insurance Root Insurance have had a torrid time at the market, losing more than 40% of their value over the last month. Additionally, the percentage of its shorted float exceeds 50%. Root claims it can disrupt the car insurance business with its effective use of telematics. However, the reality is that many of its competitors are doing the same, leaving ROOT stock with no real catalyst at this point. Root Insurance feels that most of its competitors suffer from the “innovators dilemma,” which has hampered their evolution. It feels that it offers customers superior service through “usage-based” auto insurance premiums using telematics. However, many of its competitors, including Liberty Mutual, Progressive (NYSE:PGR) and others, invest heavily in their telematics capabilities. Additionally, with Root’s business model, the average loss ratio is incredibly high at over 70%. Regulatory risks also exist with telematics due to customer concerns about their data being collected. Hence, the company needs to evolve its business model for long-term sustainability. Rocket Companies (RKT) Source: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com Rocket Companies is a Detroit-based independent mortgage banker that failed to impress investors despite its stellar quarterly performances. On top of that, the percentage of its shorted float is roughly 40%. The company’s problem is its inability to scale costs and the lack of long-term growth prospects effectively. Much of the demand for mortgages should dry up this year. The Federal Reserve will continue to keep interest rates low for the foreseeable future, with treasury rates hovering near 1%. Hence, the room for expansion in the market is shrinking at a considerable pace. Headwinds from federal eviction, foreclosures, and forbearance periods are also weighing in on RKT stock. Furthermore, the claims of Rocket being a tech company do not add up. One of the features of tech companies is their ability to scale and create more products without incurring massive variable costs. It doesn’t seem to be the case with Rocket, which bears significant borrowing and employee costs that can hardly be automated. Therefore, it’s a rocky road ahead for RKT stock at this point. Tanger Factory Outlet Centers (SKT) Source: Ritu Manoj Jethani / Shutterstock.com Tanger Factory Outlet Centers is a retail real estate investment trust that operates upscale operating centers in the U.S. and Canada. Despite the challenges faced during the pandemic, SKT stock has grown at a healthy 53% in the last three months. Now in 2021, it has a challenging outlook as occupancy levels have dropped to their lowest point in three decades. Moreover, the mid-point of this year’s core FFO is lower than the 2020 reported figure. With considerable downside risk, and short interest of roughly 33%, SKT stock is a remarkably risky bet. The company posted strong fourth-quarter results marked by a healthy increase in traffic levels and rent collection to its credit. Revenues and FFO beat analyst estimates handsomely, with traffic numbers improving to 90% of prior-year levels. However, guidance on same center occupancy and net operating income is unclear, and the midpoint of core FFO for 2021 is lower than 2020. Therefore, 2021 should be another rough year for the company.

While its bottom line improved on a year-over-year basis, unfavorable prior year developments resulted in a month-on-month sequential decline.Progressive’s (PGR) January earnings per share surged about 82% to $0.95 year-on-year. However, it decreased by 20.8% from $1.20 in December 2020.Net premiums earned during the reported period rose 10% year-over-year, while net premiums written grew 14%. Its combined ratio (percentage of premiums paid out as claims and expenses) declined to 86.3 in January from 92.1 in the prior-year period. Progressive’s policies-in-force in January were 11% higher than during the year-ago period.The company said, “Excluding the impact of catastrophe losses in both January 2021 and 2020, our companywide loss/LAE [loss adjustment expense] ratio was 5.0 points lower than January last year, in part reflecting continued lower auto accident frequency on a year-over-year basis.” (See Progressive stock analysis on TipRanks)Following the January results, Wells Fargo analyst Elyse Greenspan lowered the stock’s price target from $93 to $90 (4.4% upside potential) and maintained a Sell rating. In a note to investors, Greenspan said, “We are seeing rate declines in the personal auto sector and the level of rate should slow as the industry factors in the Covid-19 favorable frequency levels. Further, as miles driven rebound from Covid-19 lows the favorable frequency trends should subside from here.”Overall, consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 4 Holds, 2 Buys and 2 Sells. The average analyst price target of $98.38 implies upside potential of about 14% from current levels. Shares have gained around 8.4% over the past year.Furthermore, TipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 100% Bullish, compared to a sector average of 71%.Related News:Ecolab Dips 4.1% As COVID-19 Dented 4Q ProfitRingCentral’s 2021 Guidance Tops Estimates After 4Q BeatLattice Semiconductor’s 1Q Sales Outlook Exceeds Street Estimates",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=6a64ce90fece9823f883967bf377e607346b4c1c97c58b5343289606d8451314

The insurance company’s earnings per share last month surged about 142% to $1.26 from $0.52 year-on-year. Progressive’s (PGR) EPS in November soared 215% from the $0.40 posted in October. During the reported period, the company's net premium earned rose 11% year-over-year, while premium written grew 14% over the same period. Combined ratio (percentage of premiums paid out as claims and expenses) declined to 86.6 in November from 94.1 in the prior-year period. Progressive’s policies-in-force in November were 11% higher than in the year-ago period.The company said, “Excluding the impact of catastrophe losses in both November 2020 and 2019, our companywide loss/LAE ratio was 6.1 points lower than November last year, in part reflecting continued lower auto accident frequency on a year-over-year basis.” (See PGR stock analysis on TipRanks)Wells Fargo analyst Elyse Greenspan raised the stock’s price target from $96 to $99 (2.1% upside potential) and maintained a Hold rating. Greenspan noted that the November results reflect “continued favorable frequency benefits in early 2021 and stronger NPW [net premium written] growth in commercial auto.” The analyst said, “The earnings beat was counter-balanced by the slowdown in PIF [policies-in-force].”She added, “We are seeing rate declines in the personal auto sector and the level of rate should slow as the industry factors in the Covid-19 favorable frequency levels. Further, as miles driven rebound from Covid-19 lows the favorable frequency trends should subside from here.”Meanwhile, most of the Street is in line with Wells Fargo's outlook with a Hold analyst consensus. That's based on 5 Holds, 2 Buys and 1 Sell. The average price target stands at $97.38 and implies that shares are fully priced at current levels.
