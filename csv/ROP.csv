(NYSE: ROP), a leading diversified technology company, reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021. First quarter GAAP and adjusted revenue increased 13% to $1.53 billion, while organic revenue decreased 1% (compared to 4% growth in the first quarter of 2020). GAAP and adjusted gross margin were 65.0%, expanding 160 basis points and 150 basis points, respectively. GAAP diluted earnings per share (“DEPS”) was $2.73, a 20% increase, and adjusted DEPS was $3.60, an 18% increase. EBITDA increased 20% to $561 million and EBITDA margin expanded 220 basis points to 36.7%. Operating cash flow increased 54% to $560 million, representing 37% of revenue, and free cash flow increased 54% to $543 million. “We are very pleased with the strong performance by our businesses in the first quarter,” said Neil Hunn, Roper’s President and CEO. “We grew revenue, EBITDA, DEPS, and cash flow double-digits. Our 2020 software acquisitions, led by Vertafore, continue to perform very well. We also reduced our debt by approximately $500 million in the quarter, once again demonstrating our ability to quickly de-lever after acquisitions.” “The quality of our enterprise continues to improve as we see meaningful growth in our recurring revenue base,” said Mr. Hunn. “We are also encouraged by signs of recovery across end-markets that were impacted by the pandemic. As a result, we are very well positioned for continued double-digit compounding.” Increasing 2021 Guidance The Company now expects full year adjusted DEPS of $14.75 - $15.00, compared to previous guidance of $14.35 - $14.75.

Without further ado, let's delve deeper into a few of the noteworthy bullish and bearish calls of the day. Upgrades Oppenheimer analyst Christopher Glynn has upgraded Roper Technologies (ROP) to Buy from Hold, given ""positive view of FCF growth profile and increasingly affordable FCF yield, anchored by operating progress around recent heavy acquisition activity and anticipated broadening organic growth profile in coming quarters,"" the analyst said in a research note. Glynn also established a price target of $460 on the stock. Furthermore, TipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 100% Bullish on ROP, compared to a sector average of 69% A pop culture consumer products company, Funko (FNKO), also received an upgrade from BMO Capital analyst Gerrick Johnson to Hold from Sell on the company's ""innovative new product lines."" Johnson also lifted the stock's price target to $16 from $5. Overall, the Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on FNKO based on 2 Buys and 5 Holds. The average analyst price target of $17.61 implies downside potential of about 4.8% to current levels. Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Close raised the rating on Ontrak (OTRK) to Buy from Hold and lifted the price target to $46 from $32, following Jonathan Mayhew's appointment as new CEO. Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on OTRK based on 4 Buys and 2 Holds. The average analyst price target of $47.00 implies upside potential of about 36% to current levels. Cowen & Co. analyst Karl Ackerman lifted Seagate Technology’s (STX) rating from Hold to Buy and raised the price target to $95 from $66. In a note to investors, the analyst said, “We are increasingly convinced STX is transitioning from a period of secular declines toward a multiyear period of growth.” Like Ackerman, TipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 90% Bullish on STX, compared to a sector average of 69% Alcoa (AA) received an upgrade from Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Terry. Terry raised the rating from Hold to Buy and even lifted the price target to $36 from $22, citing strong balance sheet position and attractive free cash flows. The analyst expects the company to beat 1Q results. Overall, the Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on AA based on 2 Buys and 3 Holds. The average analyst price target of $28.30 implies downside potential of about 8.8% to current levels. Another Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Mullan upgraded McDonald's (MCD) from Hold to Buy and raised the stock’s price target to $244 from $232. The analyst said, “Over the balance of this year, we think that continued momentum in the U.S. business as well as an arguably underappreciated market share opportunity in the IOM [International Operated Markets] segment should lead to upward revisions to consensus EPS, specifically in 2022e and potentially in 2023e as well.” Furthermore, MCD scores a “Perfect 10” from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations. Downgrades Cowen & Co. analyst Doug Schenkel downgraded GenMark Diagnostics (GNMK) from Buy to Hold but lifted the price target to $24.05 from $23.00 after Roche Diagnostics made an all-cash acquisition offer of $1.8 billion for GenMark Diagnostics. From TipRanks’ Smart Score ranking, GenMark gets a 3 out of 10, suggesting that the stock is likely to underperform market expectations. Truist Financial analyst Tristan Richardson downgraded Plug Power (PLUG) to Hold from Buy following the company's financial restatements for FY18 and FY19. Due to accounting error news, shares of Plug Power are down over 20% in Wednesday's pre-market trading session. Furthermore, TipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 58% Bullish, compared to a sector average of 69%. Credit Suisse analyst Andrew Kuske downgraded Mercer International (MERC) to Hold from Buy, citing the recent run in its stock and uncertainty related to pulp prices over time. Meanwhile, the analyst lifted the price target to $18 from $16 on the stock. However, the Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on MERC based on 3 Buys and 2 Holds. The average analyst price target of $16.80 implies upside potential of about 11.3% to current levels. Guggenheim analyst Glen Santangelo downgraded CVS Health (CVS) to Hold from Buy, as the analyst sees balanced risk/reward after the stock recovery. TipRanks’ Stock Investors tool shows that investors currently have a Very Negative stance on CVS, with 3% of investors reducing their exposure to CVS stock over the last seven days period. National Bank analyst Mike Parkin slashed Kirkland Lake Gold’s (KL) rating to Hold from Buy and lowered the price target from C$65 to C$56 (or $44.96), as the analyst expects the upcoming interim Detour Lake technical report to be a dampener. TipRanks’ Stock Investors tool shows that investors currently have a Very Negative stance on KL, with 2.2% of investors reducing their exposure to KL stock over the last seven days period.

The analyst said, “Over the balance of this year, we think that continued momentum in the U.S. business as well as an arguably underappreciated market share opportunity in the IOM [International Operated Markets] segment should lead to upward revisions to consensus EPS, specifically in 2022e and potentially in 2023e as well.”Furthermore, MCD scores a “Perfect 10” from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.DowngradesCowen & Co. analyst Doug Schenkel downgraded GenMark Diagnostics (GNMK) from Buy to Hold but lifted the price target to $24.05 from $23.00 after Roche Diagnostics made an all-cash acquisition offer of $1.8 billion for GenMark Diagnostics.From TipRanks’ Smart Score ranking, GenMark gets a 3 out of 10, suggesting that the stock is likely to underperform market expectations.Truist Financial analyst Tristan Richardson downgraded Plug Power (PLUG) to Hold from Buy following the company's financial restatements for FY18 and FY19.

Meanwhile, the analyst lifted the price target to $18 from $16 on the stock.However, the Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on MERC based on 3 Buys and 2 Holds. The average analyst price target of $16.80 implies upside potential of about 11.3% to current levels.Guggenheim analyst Glen Santangelo downgraded CVS Health (CVS) to Hold from Buy, as the analyst sees balanced risk/reward after the stock recovery.TipRanks’ Stock Investors tool shows that investors currently have a Very Negative stance on CVS, with 3% of investors reducing their exposure to CVS stock over the last seven days period.National Bank analyst Mike Parkin slashed Kirkland Lake Gold’s (KL) rating to Hold from Buy and lowered the price target from C$65 to C$56 (or $44.96), as the analyst expects the upcoming interim Detour Lake technical report to be a dampener.TipRanks’ Stock Investors tool shows that investors currently have a Very Negative stance on KL, with 2.2% of investors reducing their exposure to KL stock over the last seven days period.Besides these bullish and bearish calls of the day, take a look at these top investment ideas: AMD: New CPU's Market Share Gains Could Be Limited to Supply IssuesKeep on Buying NIO Stock, Says Analyst Following Investor MeetingXPeng Is Undervalued After A Volatile Run Since IPO",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=5549fd78c861ef5c4a8197a067e7400e4470be14336da186bed08bcf64459ee8

As the first step, the two companies will expand the integration of their load board and TMS technologies, giving small and midsized truckload carriers easy access to automated freight-matching features that are typically available only to enterprise carriers. Next, the companies will bring new offerings to carriers to automate their day-to-day operations and reduce the manpower needed to run their businesses. Axele will become DAT’s preferred TMS provider for truckload carriers, while DAT will become the preferred load board for Axele’s TMS. Carriers can connect to the industry’s largest freight marketplace without ever leaving the Axele TMS, with Axele recommending loads that increase productivity and generate the best return based on driver availability, hours of service, deadhead miles, driver pay, driver preferences and more. Axele also easily connects with electronic logging devices (ELDs), maps and internal accounting systems, among other databases. “With the combined power and intelligence of DAT & Axele, small and midsized truckload fleets will now have a modern, connected TMS that can streamline the freight-matching process and lead to better decisions and greater profitability,” said Claude Pumila, President & CEO of DAT. “With Axele and DAT, smaller truckload carriers can benefit from TMS capabilities enjoyed by only the largest trucking companies,” said Ravi Ahuja, founder and CEO of Axele. “This agreement creates a one-stop-shop where carriers can run virtually every aspect of their business and opens the door for Axele to deliver the latest optimization technology to DAT’s customers.” To learn more about Axele subscription packages for DAT load board customers, visit https://dat.com/carriers/carrier-tms or https://axele.com/partners/dat.

For fiscal 2021, Roper anticipates earnings in the range of $14.35-$14.75 per share, compared to the consensus estimate of $14.63 per share. Roper’s CEO Neil Hunn said, “Our expanded recurring revenue base exiting 2020 provides a tailwind, and we are seeing improvement in licenses and services pipelines, which should further accelerate growth.” (See Roper Technologies stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the results, Oppenheimer analyst Christopher Glynn maintained a Hold rating on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said that his rating reflects a “positive view of FCF growth profile and increasingly affordable FCF yield, balanced by some patience as we observe progress around recent heavy acquisition activity and anticipated broadening organic growth profile in coming quarters.” The rest of the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 1 Buy and 3 Holds. The average analyst price target of $448 implies upside potential of about 14% to current levels. Shares have advanced 4.6% over the past year. What’s more, the TipRanks’ stock investors tool shows that investors currently have a Neutral stance on ROP.
