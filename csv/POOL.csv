The dividend is payable on May 28 to shareholders of record on May 17. Additionally, Pool increased its current share repurchase program by $450 million. The move increases the total authorized share buyback program to $557.4 million. The company, which is the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pools worldwide, has a presence across North America, Europe and Australia through 400 stores. Pool provides over 200 thousand branded as well as private label products, including swimming pools and associated backyard items. (See Pool stock analysis on TipRanks) On April 23, Berenberg analyst Alex Maroccia reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $474 (9.9% upside potential) from $417. Noting the company’s 1Q results as “exceptional,” Maroccia commented, “Immense operating leverage and cost controls are putting the company on track to be a building materials distribution leader in operating margins.” Maroccia added that the results show “that the pool industry is still in high demand with no signs of letting up.” Consensus on the Street is that Pool is a Moderate Buy based on 2 Buys and 3 Holds. The average analyst price target of $442.60 implies the stock is fairly priced at current levels. That’s after a 100.7% gain over the past year.

We kicked off the year with truly remarkable results, including record net sales and phenomenal bottom line results. We achieved over $1.0 billion in net sales in the first quarter of 2021, a milestone in our company’s history and a reflection of our focus on providing extraordinary customer service. Looking ahead at the remainder of the year, we expect to achieve strong growth tempered by tougher comps in the back half of the year. We are well-positioned to accomplish our strategic initiatives and have the right team in place to continue to build on our legacy of success,” commented Peter D. Arvan, president and CEO. In the first quarter of 2021, net sales increased 57% to a record $1.06 billion compared to $677.3 million in the first quarter of 2020, while base business sales grew 51%. Our sales have continued to benefit from elevated demand for residential pool products, driven by home-centric trends influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Maintenance, replacement, refurbishment and construction activity remains strong as families create and expand home-based outdoor living and entertainment spaces, resulting in broad sales gains across nearly all product categories. Gross profit increased 59% to a record $301.1 million in the first quarter of 2021 from $189.6 million in the same period of 2020. Base business gross profit improved 54% over the first quarter of 2020. Gross margin increased 40 basis points to 28.4% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 28.0% in the first quarter of 2020. Gross margin was favorably impacted by improvements from supply chain initiatives and timing differences in customer early buy purchases year-over-year, which were partially offset by increased sales of lower margin, big-ticket items in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020. Selling and administrative expenses (operating expenses) increased 12% to $172.1 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $154.0 million in the first quarter of 2020, reflecting an increase of $11.5 million in performance-based compensation expense and increases in other growth-driven costs. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 16.2% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 22.7% in the same period of 2020 due to strong expense control and our ability to leverage our existing network. Operating income in the first quarter of 2021 increased 263% to $129.0 million compared to $35.6 million in the same period in 2020. Operating margin was 12.2% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 5.3% in the first quarter of 2020. We recorded a $4.0 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, tax benefit from Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, in the quarter ended March 31, 2021, compared to a tax benefit of $8.0 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, realized in the same period of 2020. Net income increased 219% to $98.7 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $30.9 million in the first quarter of 2020. Adjusted net income, excluding the prior year impact of non-cash impairments, net of tax, increased 165% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the prior year period. Earnings per diluted share increased 223% to $2.42 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $0.75 in the same period of 2020. Excluding the impact from ASU 2016-09 in both periods and the impact of non-cash impairments, net of tax, in 2020, adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 227% to $2.32 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $0.71 in the first quarter of 2020. See the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures in the addendum of this release. On the balance sheet at March 31, 2021, total net receivables, including pledged receivables, increased 41% compared to March 31, 2020, driven by our March sales growth and partially offset by improved collections. Inventory levels increased 14% to $977.2 million compared to March 31, 2020, reflecting organic business growth and inventory from recently acquired businesses of $55.5 million. Total debt outstanding was $433.2 million at March 31, 2021, a $152.9 million decrease from total debt at March 31, 2020, as we continue to utilize operating cash flows to decrease debt balances. The increase in net income drove net cash provided by operations to $77.1 million in the first three months of 2021 compared to $19.7 million in the first three months of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the addendum to this release) was $140.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to $53.4 million in the same period of the prior year. Interest expense decreased compared to last year primarily due to lower average debt levels and lower average interest rates. “We believe that our industry-leading position, combined with strong demand trends and a solid backlog of projects, will benefit our results throughout the 2021 season. While we expect to face tougher year-over-year comparisons and potential industry capacity constraints as the year progresses, our outstanding results in the first quarter of 2021 and increased confidence in growth through the remainder of the year leads us to update our annual earnings guidance range to $11.85 to $12.60 per diluted share, including the impact of year-to-date tax benefits of $0.10. Our previous 2021 earnings guidance range was $9.12 to $9.62 per diluted share, including an estimated $0.11 tax benefit,” said Arvan.

We also exclude consolidated sales centers when we do not expect to maintain the majority of the existing business and existing sales centers that are consolidated with acquired sales centers. We generally allocate corporate overhead expenses to excluded sales centers on the basis of their net sales as a percentage of total net sales. After 15 months of operations, we include acquired, consolidated and new market sales centers in the base business calculation including the comparative prior year period. The table below summarizes the changes in our sales center count in the first three months of 2021. December 31, 2020398 Acquired locations— New locations3 Consolidated location(1) March 31, 2021400 Adjusted EBITDA We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or net loss plus interest and other non-operating expenses, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation, goodwill and other non-cash impairments and equity earnings or loss in unconsolidated investments. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of cash flow or liquidity as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We have included Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental disclosure because we believe that it is widely used by our investors, industry analysts and others as a useful supplemental accrual-based liquidity measure in conjunction with net cash flows provided by or used in operating activities to help investors understand our ability to provide cash flows to fund growth, service debt, repurchase shares and pay dividends as well as compare our cash flow generating capacity from period to period, excluding the impact of period-to-period changes in working capital. We believe Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, operating income or loss, net income or loss, net cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement line items reported in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, which may limit its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures.
