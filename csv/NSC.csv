Monday’s offering will be just the ninth century bond issued by a corporation since 2005, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Investors have recently shied away from taking on duration risk as bond yields rise amid an economic recovery from the pandemic. However, there are signs they’re starting to warm up to longer-dated bonds again as 30-year Treasury yields stabilize and volatility subsides, encouraging more companies to issue further out the curve.Read more: JPMorgan to BlackRock turn away from duration as economies openBonds maturing in 10 years or more generated total returns of 1.7% in April, the most of any high-grade maturity bucket, according to Bloomberg Barclays index data. EBay Inc., Equinix Inc. and Southern Co. are among high-grade companies selling 30-year debt Monday.While century bonds -- especially those from companies -- are rare, countries tend to be more common issuers. Peru sold $4 billion of such debt in November, back when the 30-year yielded around 1.5%. It’s now up to nearly 2.3%.Norfolk’s century bond will yield 180 basis points over Treasuries, about 20 basis points less than initial discussions, and proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. It’s also selling $500 million of 10-year notes to be allocated for green projects.Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co. managed the deal, said the person, who asked not to be identified as the details are private.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=534a29d12e71d48d83d534b6aab5799b179dadd6f23dbb0317e6fc3222631c7b

company,1616448818,3 Railroad Stocks To Watch Amid Canadian Pacific And Kansas City Southern Merger,66894341,,NSC,Yahoo,"Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (NYSE: CP) and Kansas City Southern (NYSE: KSU) announced on Sunday they would merge in a deal valued at about $29 billion in cash and shares. What Happened: The new company, Canadian Pacific Kansas City, will create a Canada-Mexico-U.S. railroad with a combined 20,000 miles of rail. Canadian Pacific Kansas City will be a larger competitor to other rail service providers and will ease supply chain difficulties between the three member countries of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). It will also provide the companies’ customers with an eco-friendlier alternative to truck transportation, according to Canadian Pacific's press release. Why It Matters: The Canadian Pacific Kansas City rail service will have three main competitors to keep on watch: Canadian National Railways (NYSE: CNI), headquartered in Montreal, Quebec operates 20,000 miles of rail across Canada, the Midwest and the Southern United States and through Mexico. Canadian National has a market cap of $80.89 billion and was trading down 2.25% at $113.90 at last check. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UCP), headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, boasts 32,340 miles of route track across the Midwest, West and Southwestern United States. Union Pacific has a market cap of $139.37 billion and was trading down 1.87% at $206.86 at last check. Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE: NSC), headquartered in Norfolk, Virginia, operates 19,500 route miles in 22 states and the District of Columbia. Norfolk Southern has a market cap of $66.24 billion and was trading up 0.96% at $262.96 at last check.
