Biogen will gain exclusive rights to Orelabrutinib for the worldwide treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) and few other autoimmune diseases outside of China (including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan). InnoCare will keep its exclusive rights to use Orelabrutinib to treat cancer and other autoimmune diseases in China.



Orelabrutinib is a small molecule Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) that is administered orally to patients of MS, cancer, and certain other autoimmune diseases as a potential treatment. Its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier makes it an excellent candidate for MS treatment. Notably, study is still underway on Orelabrutinib in a multi-country, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial in relapsing-remitting MS.



Per the agreement, InnoCare will receive $125 million as an upfront payment. Apart from this, as the collaboration progresses, InnoCare might also get paid up to $812.5 million upon achieving potential development milestones and in potential commercial payments. Furthermore, InnoCare is eligible to receive tiered royalties of 13%-19% on expected net sales of any product as a result of the collaboration.



Biogen’s three-decade-long extensive research on MS has led to a portfolio of effective MS products. (See Biogen stock chart on TipRanks)



Alfred Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D., Head of Research and Development at Biogen, said, “Given the complex and chronic nature of MS, we believe the unique characteristics of Orelabrutinib, combining high selectivity and CNS penetrance, may translate to potential clinical advantages relative to other BTKi programs.”



Moreover, Jasmine Cui, Ph.D., Co-Founder, Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer, InnoCare, said, “Biogen is a recognized leader in neuroscience and we believe this transaction will help advance the development of Orelabrutinib in MS.""



On July 9, FDA commissioner Janet Woodcock confirmed her request for an OIG (Office of Inspector General) investigation into the possible under-the-table interactions between FDA and Biogen regarding the review process of its controversial Alzheimer's drug, Aducanumab (marketed as Aduhelm). Following this, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Paul Matteis reiterated a Buy rating on Biogen, with a price target of $443, implying a 26.9% upside potential to current levels.



Matteis said the “headline looks awful,"" referring to Dr. Woodcock's letter to the OIG. The analyst believes that Dr. Woodcock's letter seems to be a move to remove pressure from the FDA. He further said that despite working up Biogen’s shareholders, Dr. Woodcock's investigation request is not expected to materially impact Aducanumab's marketing authorization.



Matteis also believes that as Biogen ramps the launch of Aduhelm, the fundamentals of the company will drive its shares, and shareholders will move out of theoretical fears. 



Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 15 Buys and 11 Holds. The average Biogen price target of $430.41 implies 23.3% upside potential to current levels.

Massachusetts-based Biogen is a multinational biotechnology company that develops, manufactures and sells therapies for the treatment of neurodegenerative and neurological diseases.



Biogen’s shares closed 3% lower on Friday after Janet Woodcock, the FDA’s Acting Commissioner, asked the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to check whether the talks were consistent with the agency’s policies.



The spokesperson of HHS's Office of the Inspector General, Tesia Williams, said, “We received the letter and are reviewing it for appropriate action.” (See Biogen stock chart on TipRanks)



The FDA approved Aduhelm on June 7 despite strong objections from its experts. Following the approval, Woodcock said, in a letter posted on Twitter (TWTR), “There continue to be concerns raised... regarding contacts between representatives from Biogen and FDA during the review process.”



Stifel analyst Paul Matteis recently reiterated a Buy rating on Biogen with a price target of $443 (23.7% upside potential). The analyst said the actual content of Woodcock’s letter “doesn't seem to pique questions in a way that would actually impact Aduhelm’s marketing authorization.”



Overall, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus based on 15 Buys and 11 Holds. The average Biogen price target of $430.41 implies 20.2% upside potential. The company’s shares have gained 47.4% year-to-date.



According to TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, Biogen scores a “Perfect 10,” suggesting that the stock is likely to outperform market averages.
