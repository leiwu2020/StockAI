Following the announcement, shares of the financial services provider declined 2.3% in Thursday’s trading session. The financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed yet. 



The companies expect to close the transaction in the second half of 2021, after fulfilling customary conditions and approvals.



Last year, both the companies had joined hands to create a suite of oversight and contingent net asset value (NAV) services for asset managers and asset owners seeking independent oversight and backup NAV capabilities.



With this deal, BNY Mellon will have access to Milestone's pControl™ platform, which will expand BNY Mellon's digital offerings and core capabilities. Also, clients will be able to choose from existing and new end-to-end solutions that add operating model choices, strategic product capabilities and industry connectivity. (See BNY Mellon stock chart on TipRanks)



The CEO of Asset Servicing and Head of Digital at BNY Mellon, Roman Regelman, said, ""We gain both industry-leading technology as well as the expertise that Milestone is known for globally. This is a significant step in our continuous evolution — blending leading edge technologies and services to deliver greater efficiency and value for our clients.""



On July 5, Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr reiterated a Hold rating on the stock with a price target of $52 (7.6% upside potential from current levels). The analyst expects BNY Mellon’s earnings to break even in the third quarter of 2021.



The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic on the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 4 Buys and 4 Holds. The average BNY Mellon price target of $54.13 implies 12% upside potential from current levels.



TipRanks’ Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool shows that confidence in BNY Mellon is currently Neutral, as the cumulative change in holdings across all 17 hedge funds that were active in the last quarter witnessed an increase of 3.1 million shares.

He also said the company won’t be selling any of the Bitcoin it holds.The largest cryptocurrency dropped as much as 15% to just above $46,000, before paring some of the retreat. It was down about 6% to $50,980 as of 1:09 p.m. in Tokyo on Thursday. The rush to sell briefly caused outages at some digital-token exchanges. Bitcoin is still up more than fivefold in the past year.Musk’s move comes after Tesla disclosed in February that it had purchased $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and planned to accept it as a payment. That announcement added legitimacy to the cryptocurrency as an increasingly acceptable form of payment and an investment, especially coming from a large member of the S&P 500 with a high-profile CEO who commands a big following among retail investors and the general public.Tesla’s website, which had a support page dedicated to Bitcoin, noted that the token was the only cryptocurrency that Tesla accepts in the continental U.S. Musk has also tweeted frequently about Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency started as a joke in 2013 -- and he quipped about being the “Dogefather” before and during his stint hosting the “Saturday Night Live” show on May 8. He tweeted on Tuesday, “Do you want Tesla to accept Doge?”Tesla’s addition of Bitcoin to its balance sheet was the most visible catalyst during this year’s rally in the digital currency. Bitcoin jumped 16% that day, the biggest one-day gain since the Covid-19 inspired financial markets volatility in March 2020.Optimism grew after Mastercard Inc., Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and other firms moved to make it easier for customers to use cryptocurrencies, fueling the mainstream resurgence that took Bitcoin from about $29,000 at the end of last year to as high as almost $65,000 in April.Bitcoin mining is consuming 66 times more electricity than it did back in late 2015, and the carbon emissions associated with it will likely face increasing scrutiny, according to a recent Citigroup Inc. report.Musk is no stranger to considering the issue of crypto’s environmental impact.Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management LLC published a report last month saying cryptocurrency mining can drive investment in solar power and make more renewable energy available to the grid. Twitter Inc.’s Jack Dorsey retweeted a post on the white paper with the comment that Bitcoin “incentivizes renewable energy.” Musk replied to Dorsey’s tweet, saying simply, “True.”Musk’s tweet on Wednesday took many in the cryptocurrency community by surprise, including Nic Carter, founding partner at Castle Island Ventures, and a leading voice among defenders of Bitcoin’s energy use.“Surely he would have done his diligence prior to accepting Bitcoin?’ Carter said. “Very odd and confusing to see this quick reversal.”It’s unclear what prompted the decision and Musk and Zachary Kirkhorn, Tesla’s chief financial officer, didn’t immediately respond to an email inquiry for comment. Kirkhorn in March added the tongue-in-cheek title “Master of Coin,” according to a regulatory filing.Tesla’s first-quarter earnings were bolstered by the sale of 10% of its Bitcoin holdings. Musk said last month the disposal was intended to demonstrate the token’s liquidity, and added that he’s retained his personal investment in the cryptocurrency. Kirkhorn said on an earnings call that the company believes in Bitcoin’s long-term value.(Updates markets in the third paragraph.

The rebound reverses a two-week slump that had pushed Bitcoin below its 100-day moving average amid technical warnings from Wall Street and fears of a growing crypto bubble.Some pinned Monday’s move on a tweet Saturday from billionaire Elon Musk, who in the past has affected prices with his comments on the social platform.In a potential reference to cryptocurrencies, the Tesla Inc. founder asked “What does the future hodl?”, using a term often seen as meaning “hold on for dear life” that supporters use to refer to buying and holding their digital assets.“There is always a sharp movement when Tesla’s CEO talks about Bitcoin on Twitter ahead of quarterly earnings,” said Laurent Kssis, global head of exchange-traded products at crypto firm 21Shares AG. “As the U.S. wakes up, we could see further appreciation leading to $54,000-$54,500.”Cryptocurrency-exposed stocks also rose. Monex Group Inc. gained 7.1%, while Remixpoint Inc. increased 7% and Ceres Inc. added 6.1%. In the U.S., Coinbase Global Inc. was up 4.6% in pre-market trading, while Riot Blockchain Inc. jumped 9%.Bitcoin futures weren’t pricing much more in the way of further gains Monday, however. April contracts rose to $53,665, while those for May through September ranged from $52,145 to $55,635, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“Bitcoin created a large gap down last week that could stick around far longer than bulls would want to see,” said Rick Bensignor, president of Bensignor Investment Strategies, in a note Monday.Bitcoin has done well over the medium term, retaining a gain of about 80% year-to-date as big-name investors endorse it and institutions from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Bank of New York Mellon advance their offerings around cryptocurrencies. JPMorgan’s John Normand reiterated in a note Friday that Bitcoin’s ascent has been steeper than any other financial innovation or bubble of the past 50 years.“Crypto bulls breathed a sigh of relief as last week’s deep rout across the space failed to extend,” Steen Jakobsen, chief investment officer at Saxo Bank, wrote in a note. However, “it has quite a wall to climb to fully neutralize the recent selloff.”(Updates with quotes, more context throughout)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=78f903630ac31f19cf8823609433a688279ce444614dd38be24f14ee21da7b04

That promises to remove a barrier that has discouraged some big investors from joining the rush into the Chinese bond market as regulators further open it to those outside the country.BNY Mellon’s move “should help liquidity and demand for government securities, and incentivize holders of Chinese government bonds, given they now can use them for collateral,” said Sacha Tihanyi, head of emerging market strategy at TD Securities.In a traditional repo agreement, one borrows funds by selling securities to lenders with an agreement to repurchase them back in the future. These securities, usually high-quality assets such as U.S. Treasuries, essentially act as collateral that lenders can seize upon when borrowers default.In a tri-party transaction, a third entity acts as an intermediary between the borrower and lender to facilitate services like collateral selection, payment and settlement.The bank said its platform is custody agnostic, meaning that clients can use BNY Mellon as an agent without having the bank act as the custodian for the assets involved in the trades.BNY Mellon’s move follows a similar program launched in 2018, when the bank allowed clients to pledge Chinese stocks purchased via Hong Kong’s Stock Connect as collateral.“It is a big deal,” Brian Ruane, chief executive of BNY Mellon’s clearance and collateral management business, said in an interview. “While it’s in the early stage of development, over time, this could be a large opportunity, given the size of the fixed-income market.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=cff506b94ed4131018f7016dea88ba1d8467fca9da50aeeba2bf05378ad3926c
