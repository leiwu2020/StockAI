Based in New York, Philip Morris manufactures and sells cigarettes, tobacco, nicotine-containing products, smoke-free products and associated electronic devices and accessories in over 180 countries.



The transaction value represents a multiple of around 14 times Vectura’s 2020 EBITDA. Phillip Morris seeks to fund the transaction with existing cash balance.



With this buyout, Phillip Morris seeks to create a fully-owned pipeline of products in the prescription drug and over-the-counter categories that will complement Vectura’s CDMO business and meet requirements of its existing client base. (See Philip Morris stock chart on TipRanks)



CEO of Philip Morris Jacek Olczak said, “The market for inhaled therapeutics is large and growing rapidly, with significant potential for expansion into new application areas. PMI has the commitment to science and the financial resources to empower Vectura’s skilled team to execute on an ambitious long-term vision.”



On July 2, Morgan Stanley analyst Pamela Kaufman reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $110 (11.8% upside potential).



The stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 6 Buys and 1 Hold. The average Philip Morris price target stands at $111.43, implying upside potential of 13.3% from current levels.



TipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 97% Bullish on Philip Morris, compared to the sector average of 72%.

There is reason to be wary of tobacco-related stocks from an ethical perspective, and Philip Morris’ (PM) valuation multiple certainly reflects this. 



Additionally,  cigarette stocks are battling a number of headwinds right now. Decisions by the U.S. government could make owning cigarette companies as unprofitable as they may be unethical, and long-term investors don’t like this. The government's recent proposal to reduce the amount of nicotine in cigarettes to levels at which they’re not addictive has sent cigarette stocks plunging.



Despite these obstacles, Philip Morris has outperformed its peers during this difficult period. Here’s why. (See Philip Morris stock analysis on TipRanks)



Superior Business Model and Geographic Focus 



Philip Morris does not sell or market cigarettes in the U.S. Rather, the company’s portfolio of brands, including Marlboro cigarettes, are focused on emerging markets, where smoking is declining at a slower rate than in the U.S.



It appears this targeted strategic move has paid dividends for the company in more ways than one. Shares of Philip Morris are up substantially since the government announcement about reducing nicotine levels, while its peers have lagged significantly over the past month.



Additionally, it has recently been reported that Philip Morris is eyeing opportunities in the cannabis space. Shifting away from harmful, addictive cigarettes toward what many view as essential and constructive medicinal alternatives makes a lot of sense to many investors.



Given the size and scale of Philip Morris’ existing production capacity, shifting some production toward cannabis pre-rolls or other value-added products seems to be practical. With the right partnership and political backdrop (cannabis isn’t yet legal for recreational use under federal law in the United States, but is so in a growing number of countries globally), such an investment could pay off handsomely over the long run.



Philip Morris Stock Isn’t Without Risk



That said, as with any investment, it’s important to assess the underlying risks in PM stock. Indeed, Philip Morris’ core profile makes it untouchable for many large institutional funds and portfolio managers with ethical mandates. PM stock remains on the fringes of what is viewed as a respectable investment today.



Additionally, the Biden administration’s proposed limit on nicotine levels could set the stage for other countries to follow suit. Such a move would certainly hamper Philip Morris’ long-term growth prospects. Investors have valid reason to sleep uneasy at night on this announcement.



Furthermore, given the prevailing negative attitude toward nicotine, many view Philip Morris’ potential move toward cannabis as an essential long-term strategic shift, rather than a short-term earnings-boosting endeavor. 



What Analysts Are Saying About PM Stock



According to TipRanks’ analyst rating consensus, PM stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 8 analyst ratings, there are 7 Buy and 1 Hold recommendations.



As for price targets, the average analyst PM price target is $109.38. Analyst price targets range from a low of $105.00 per share to a high of $114.00 per share.







Bottom Line



The direction in which Philip Morris has already headed toward becoming a more favorable cigarette player is commendable. Over the near- to medium-term, the company’s geographic positioning is likely to provide some downside protection.



Over the longer term, if Philip Morris can make the transition toward health-focused cannabis operations, investors may view this stock more favorably.



It’s okay not to like Philip Morris' current business model. However, the company's activities in ten or twenty years from now appears to be open season. There is room for investors to be excited about that.
