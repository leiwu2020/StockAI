Here is Benzinga's everything-that-matters guide for the earnings announcement. What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS. Earnings And Revenue Based on management's projections, Intl Flavors & Fragrances analysts model for earnings of $1.19 per share on sales of $1.26 billion. In the same quarter last year, Intl Flavors & Fragrances posted EPS of $1.46 on sales of $1.28 billion. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the ""consensus estimates."" A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an ""earnings surprise"" and may move the stock by a considerable margin. View more earnings on IFF The Wall Street estimate would represent a 18.49% decline in the company's earnings. Revenue would have fallen 1.87% from the same quarter last year. Here is how the company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past: Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 EPS Estimate 1.46 1.31 1.59 1.45 EPS Actual 1.40 1.36 1.62 1.46 Revenue Estimate 1.28 B 1.22 B 1.31 B 1.27 B Revenue Actual 1.27 B 1.20 B 1.35 B 1.28 B Stock Performance Shares of Intl Flavors & Fragrances were trading at $127.37 as of February 08. Over the last 52-week period, shares are down 9.18%. Given that these returns are generally negative, long-term shareholders are probably unhappy going into this earnings release. Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call. Intl Flavors & Fragrances is scheduled to hold the call at 10:00:00 ET and can be accessed here.

The company stated that the exchange offer would expire on January 29, 2021.The offer forms a part of DuPont’s “Reverse Morris Trust” arrangement with International Flavors & Fragrances, which was announced a year ago. Under the arrangement, DuPont had agreed to split-off its N&B business and then combine it with IFF.DuPont said, “Following the exchange offer, N&B will merge with a subsidiary of IFF and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of IFF, and shares of N&B common stock will be converted into shares of IFF common stock. In the merger the N&B shares will convert into IFF shares on a 1.0:1.0 basis, so participants in the exchange offer will instead receive shares of IFF common stock in the merger.”Last month, Delaware’s Supreme Court upheld a March 2020 judgement of the dismissal of a lawsuit against DuPont wherein the company was accused of massively downplaying the cost of environmental liabilities imposed on spin-off company Chemours. (See DD stock analysis on TipRanks)Following the ruling, Deutsche Bank analyst David Begleiter raised the stock’s price target to $90 (26.6% upside potential) from $65 and reiterated a Buy rating. Begleiter believes that the ruling will lead to a new cost arrangement between the two companies, which will lessen investors’ concern over DuPont’s PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid) exposure.Like Begleiter, the rest of the Street also has a bullish outlook on the stock. The Strong Buy analyst consensus is based on 6 unanimous Buys. Meanwhile, the average analyst price target stands at $74, and implies 4.1% upside potential at current levels.
