Overall, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 18 Buys and 1 Hold. The average ServiceNow analyst price target of $615.17 implies 12.7% upside potential from current levels. The company’s shares have gained 36.2% over the past year.

(FSR), an EV manufacturer, inked a product and service agreement with the software company ServiceNow (NOW). Per the terms of the deal, Fisker will buy ServiceNow’s IT Service Management (ITSM) Pro and Software Asset Management (SAM) solutions for its employees. Through ServiceNow’s digital workflows, Fisker plans to create frictionless experiences for its employees. The product will allow them to spend less time on non-critical tasks so that more time can be devoted to building EVs. According to Fisker, ServiceNow’s ITSM Pro solution will be used to deliver scalable services, augment productivity and create resilient IT service experiences for its employees. The company’s SAM solution will be used to optimize IT productivity, cost, and resilience, enabling employees to work faster and smarter. Fisker CEO Henrik Fisker commented, “Our ability to hit our quality, cost and delivery targets is heavily dependent on the software, infrastructure and tools we give to our employees. We have set up our company to operate lean and fast. Partnering with ServiceNow will help us deliver against those targets.” (See Fisker stock analysis on TipRanks) The production and delivery of the company’s first vehicle, the Ocean electric SUV, is expected to start in November 17, 2022. At the beginning, Fisker will manufacture the vehicle in Europe and sell it across multiple markets in Europe and North America. On May 18, R.F. Lafferty analyst Jaime Perez decreased the stock’s price target to $19 (51.9% upside potential) from $24 and maintained a Buy rating. Perez commented, “The company is making progress towards its production and delivery forecast of the Fisker Ocean in the fourth quarter of 2022 with its contract manufacture Magna (MGA). The Ocean begins its next evolution as the company commences supplier sourcing, production tooling, and building prototypes. In addition, the company increased its employee headcount to 203, double from year-end 2020 as it prepares for product launches.” The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 5 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $25.25 implies 101.8% upside potential to current levels. Shares have increased 22.2% over the past year.

company,1620705660,"IBM Launches New Cloud, AI Services in Bid to Modernize Business",67744416,,NOW,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines Corp. is rolling out a new product that will help businesses automate tasks, capitalizing on the rise of chat bots and virtual assistants during the pandemic and taking another step in its pivot toward cloud services and artificial intelligence.The tool, called Watson Orchestrate, uses artificial intelligence to select and sequence the prepackaged skills needed to perform a task across sales, human resources, or operations functions. It will be compatible with Slack Technologies Inc. and email as well as connect to business applications like Salesforce.com Inc., SAP SE and Workday Inc. The product is expected to be available later this year.“We will look back on this year and last as the moment the world entered the digital century in full force,” said Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna in a statement. “In the same way that we electrified factories and machines in the past century, we will use hybrid cloud to infuse AI into software and systems in the 21st century.”Watson Orchestrate is one of a slate of new offerings and initiatives IBM is unveiling at its annual Think Conference, where its evolution from century-old company into a modern enterprise will be on full display. The pandemic accelerated the adoption of cloud services, a trend Krishna has been keen to optimize since he took over as CEO last year, and as part of an effort to revive growth after years of shrinking revenue.IBM is focusing on what it calls hybrid-cloud, which allows companies to use a combination of their own data centers and computing resources leased from others and accessed online. The strategy fueled IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, a deal Krishna helped arrange, for about $34 billion. IBM is also betting that corporate users will adopt AI in more of their systems.The Armonk, New York-based company partnered with Ernst & Young LLP to create a hub that will focus on offering regulatory compliance, digital trust and security services to financial services companies through IBM’s hybrid cloud platform. IBM is also adding an upgrade to its Cloud Pak for Data service that the company said will generate answers to queries eight-times faster, and it’s rolling out Project CodeNet, an open source dataset with millions of lines of code to speed up businesses applications of artificial intelligence.The new offerings come on the heels of IBM introducing its 2 nanometer chip, which is the world’s smallest and first chip of that size. IBM is working closely with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. and Intel Corp. to bring the chips to market, Krishna said on a call with journalists, adding that the ongoing semiconductor shortage is “very worrisome.”Watch: IBM Unveils World’s Smallest, First 2 Nanometer Chip (Video)IBM’s rivals, including Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, have also been moving to expand the use of AI for cloud computing customers across a variety of industries. Microsoft, for example, introduced new tools last year for doctors to use chat bots to more easily communicate with patients. Google announced a tie-up in February with Ford Motor Co. that will provide data analytics to the factory floor and let drivers use voice-recognition technology in their cars. Cloud software maker ServiceNow Inc has acquired several AI companies to refine products that help clients automate numerous personnel, customer service and information technology tasks.Krishna reaffirmed IBM is “on a path to sustained mid-single digit growth over the medium term,” and that the new offerings would eventually translate into revenue growth as clients increase adoption.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=524929862b74f61779affd92e368d4aae53dfcb9a04c759f884bb7194ae0d5b4

The stock plunged by 9% to $505 in response to its first quarter report. However, the company did beat the Street’s estimates. Adjusted earnings jumped by 45% to $1.52 per share and revenues grew by 30% to $1.36 billion. As for the Street consensus, the estimate for the bottom line was $1.34 per share, and $1.34 billion for the top line. Unfortunately, the guidance was a bit of a disappointment. Management guided for second quarter revenue growth of 27%-28%, to $1.29 billion-$1.295 billion, but analysts were looking for $1.305 billion. Another red flag was that ServiceNow had a tougher time landing $1 million-plus deals for the quarter, which came in at 53. In the prior quarter, the number was a much more robust 89. It should be noted that when it comes to large deals, the numbers can get choppy as it’s easy for them to slip into another quarter. That said, it’s a warning sign when there is a significant drop-off. The Product Roadmap Even though ServiceNow is a large company, it has still been able to maintain a strong pace of innovation. The latest version of its platform – called Québec – is certainly evidence of this. There are more than 1,700 new functions, and yes, many of them are focused on cutting-edge AI (artificial intelligence) technologies. The company has the advantage of a massive installed base that generates huge amounts of data. This means that ServiceNow can create rich AI models. Another important focus for the company has been on low-code approaches. As a result, a non-technical employee can effectively create bots and workflows on the ServiceNow platform. This greatly expands that effectiveness and scale of the technology – leading to higher ROI (return on investment). And finally, ServiceNow has been investing heavily in RPA (robotic process automation). This essentially allows for automating tedious and repetitive processes. The leader in the category is UiPath (PATH), which recently pulled off a highly successful IPO. However, ServiceNow is catching up. For example, the company recently announced the acquisition of Intellibot, which will greatly expand the RPA capabilities. Bottom Line On ServiceNow The COVID-19 pandemic has been a major catalyst for ServiceNow. Companies have had little choice but to find ways to automate systems in order to handle remote workforces. Now, it’s true that the growth may start to decelerate as the pandemic fades, which is perhaps why investors might be jittery about ServiceNow stock. But despite all of this, its long-term prospects do remain promising. The digital transformation trend is secular and SeviceNow has a strong platform to help customers with the journey. CEO Bill McDermott stated on the earnings call, “ServiceNow is the strategic authority for digital transformation across the enterprise. We have expanded the boundaries from IT to employee, customer and now creator workflows for citizen developers.” Based on research from IDC, the market opportunity is poised to reach a whopping $7.8 trillion by 2024. In other words, there is lots of runway left for growth. Wall Street’s Take Even with the recent drop in the share price, Wall Street is generally upbeat on the prospects. In the last three months, only Buy ratings, 16 to be precise, have been assigned. So, NOW has a Strong Buy consensus rating. Given the $622.38 average analyst price target, shares could gain 23% in the year ahead.

The acquisition is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2021. Recently, the Now Platform Quebec Release was delivered, with it designed to enable enterprises to speed up their digital transformation and enhance productivity. The company expects Intellibot to complement these capabilities.

Notably, along with fulfilling the local data residency requirements, these centers will form part of ServiceNow’s advanced architecture and will continue to maintain the scalability of the company’s cloud services. The company also plans to increase its employee base significantly in the country within the next three years. Following the acquisition, Needham analyst Jack Andrews reiterated a Buy rating and the price target of $595 (24.4% upside potential) on the stock. Andrews said, “The acquisition will bring RPA and low-code together in a single platform comparable to other vendors in software, and thus should provide further leverage for NOW to address some of the fastest-growing segments in enterprise software, as we believe more organizations are looking for emerging automation features following the pandemic.” Shares have exploded 75.8% over the past year, while Wall Street analysts are still bullish about the stock. The Strong Buy consensus rating boasts 18 Buy ratings versus 1 Hold rating. Looking ahead, the average analyst price target stands at $618.84, putting the upside potential at 29.4% over the next 12 months. On top of this, ServiceNow scores an 8 out of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.
