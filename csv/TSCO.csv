Despite the robust results, shares of the largest U.S. rural lifestyle retailer plunged 4.3% to close at $180.94 on July 19.



The company reported adjusted earnings of $3.19 per share, beating analysts’ expectations of $2.90 per share. Net Sales of $3.6 billion exceeded the consensus estimate of $3.42 billion.



Meanwhile, earnings per share jumped 10%, while net sales increased 13.4% on a year-over-year basis. The company reported earnings of $2.90 per share in the prior-year period. (See TSCO stock charts on TipRanks)



Comparable store sales grew 10.5% in the quarter, driven by a higher number of transactions, average ticket growth, and increased demand for everyday merchandise. Notably, same-store sales increased 41% on a 2-year stack basis.



Tractor Supply’s CEO Hal Lawton commented, “The team is executing at a high level and advancing our Life Out Here Strategy while navigating the cost pressures we are experiencing. With a resilient business model, ongoing market share growth and strategic investments to transform the Company, we are excited about the significant opportunities ahead of us and remain committed to disciplined financial returns and sustained profitable growth.""



Based on robust Q2 results and market share gains, the company raised its guidance for Fiscal 2021. It now forecasts adjusted earnings in the range of $7.70 - $8.00 per share, while the previously guided EPS range was $7.05 - $7.40. Revenues are forecast to be in the range of $12.1 – $12.3 billion versus the previous guidance range of $11.4 billion - $11.7 billion.



Moreover, comparable store sales are forecast to grow 11% to 13% versus the prior guidance range of 5% to 8%.



Following the upbeat Q2 results, Robert W. Baird analyst Peter Benedict reiterated a Buy rating and a price target of $210 (16.1% upside potential) on the stock.



Benedict sees current share price weakness as a buying opportunity and remains confident that the company’s competitive moat should widen going forward and lead to significant share price gains. He said that ""some conservatism is at play,” especially for the fourth quarter.



Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 9 Buys and 9 Holds. The average Tractor Supply price target of $201.07 implies 11.1% upside potential to current levels. Shares of TSCO have jumped 25% over the past year.



Tractor Supply scores a “Perfect 10” on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

While that’s played out for much of the group, the opposite is happening in some corners of the market.Shares of furniture makers, home-improvement retailers and outdoor recreation companies continue to soar to new heights with few signs that the surge in demand that propelled sales over the past year is abating. RH, the purveyor of $4,000 couches, has jumped 54% this year. RV retailer Camping World Holdings Inc. is up 65%.The reasons why were on full display this week as first-quarter financial results poured in. Swimming pool supplies company Pool Corp. and rural lifestyle retailer Tractor Supply Co. were among companies that smashed Wall Street estimates. Both cited growing demand fueled by behavioral changes related to the virus as well as government stimulus, prompting higher forecasts for the rest of the year.“Our customer base is experiencing robust, broad-based shopping patterns that provide significant opportunities for growth,” Hal Lawton, chief executive officer of Tractor Supply, said on the company’s earnings call. “These types of trends can simply be described as once-in-a-generation.”Millions of vaccine doses delivered in the U.S. were supposed to unleash a wave of pent-up demand at places like movie theaters and gyms that were hard -- if not impossible -- to access last year. While that’s been true in many cases, habits formed during the peak of the crisis are proving to be longer lasting than many had anticipated.The other big factor is a red-hot housing market helped by low mortgage rates and a relocation from cities to suburbs. That continues to drive demand for everything from home furnishings to materials needed for construction and remodeling.The trends behind most of these stock rallies are likely to continue well into 2022, according to Cristina Fernandez, an analyst with Telsey Advisory Group. She expects strong results from Home Depot Inc. and Lowe’s Cos Inc. in coming quarters thanks to pent-up demand from do-it-yourself customers and professional services.Spending HabitsOf course, many of last year’s biggest winners have lost billions in market value this year as investors brace for slower growth. Netflix Inc. showed this week that huge subscriber gains clocked in 2020 are proving difficult to maintain. The stock sank 7% on Wednesday after reporting about 4 million new subscribers in the first quarter, the weakest start to a year since 2013. The stock is now trading around the level it was in July.Netflix’s results were seen as a potential harbinger of similar results for others like Peloton Interactive Inc., whose 13% decline this week was its worst since February. After gaining more than five-fold in 2020, the maker of stationary bikes and treadmills has tumbled 33% this year. Amazon.com Inc. results on Thursday will be closely watched for signs of slowing growth in e-commerce and web services sales.With Americans’ savings still flush from missed spending opportunities and stimulus, the near-term leadership of the stock market may very well be determined by where they choose to spend it. Goldman Sachs strategists including Arjun Menon and David Kostin raised their recommendation on consumer-discretionary stocks to “overweight” in a note on Thursday as excess savings meet the continued reopening of the economy. They expect the group will experience the largest positive earnings revisions of any sector.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=906a7343a9a9a7873c21f48b1f14ceb2c1b0d13e95246646c8d0084f3f8ded05
