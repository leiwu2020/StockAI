As part of the deal, REA, which is majority-owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. empire, will get an 18% equity interest in PropertyGuru and appoint a director to its board. No price has been disclosed for the deal.“We are investing in these markets as they emerge out of Covid in the coming years,” Chief Executive Officer Hari V. Krishnan said in an interview with Bloomberg TV’s Haslinda Amin and Rishaad Salamat. “Some of the macro mega trends like urbanization, digitization, the emergence of the middle class, remain in place.”The announcement comes after a flurry of deal-making by the most valuable startups in the region. Ride-hailing and payments giant Gojek and e-commerce leader Tokopedia announced earlier this month they will combine their businesses to create the largest internet company in Indonesia. Close Gojek rival Grab Holdings Inc. last month agreed to go public in the U.S. through a combination with Altimeter Growth Corp. in the largest-ever merger with a blank-check company.​For PropertyGuru, the deal will likely reduce competition in Malaysia and Thailand where the company has been competing against REA’s affiliates. Krishnan said the firm will keep the existing brands and invest in their development for the foreseeable future.The CEO declined to provide a specific timeframe for going public. The company regularly reviews the potential for an initial public offering after scrapping plans to list on the Australian stock exchange in October 2019 on concerns over its targeted valuation of A$1.36 billion ($1 billion). In September, it announced S$300 million ($220 million) in new funding from existing backers TPG Capital LP and KKR & Co Inc.“If the opportunity is right and if we feel our assets would be valued by public market investors, we will take it public,” he said. “But today’s announcement is more about building the core capability set for business and investing heavily into Malaysia and Thailand.”Malaysia Announces 2-Week National Lockdown Amid Virus FightThe transaction, which is expected to close in July, is conditional on REA’s divestment of its 27% stake in PropertyGuru’s rival 99 Group, which it has a joint venture with in Singapore and Indonesia. “Discussions are well progressed in relation to the divestment,” according to REA’s stock exchange filing on Monday.99 Group CEO Darius Cheung told Bloomberg News that his company is currently in discussions with investors to raise funds, some of which will be used to acquire REA’s 27% stake in 99.“This move allows us to free from the shackles of having our most significant shareholder being a public company,” Cheung said, adding that he plans to enter Malaysia to compete against PropertyGuru.The Malaysian and Thailand businesses are expected to contribute A$15 million to REA’s revenue in the fiscal years of 2021, though they will probably reduce its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by about A$11 million, according to the REA filing.REA shares fell as much as 0.7% in Australia on Monday.Launched in 2007 to help Singapore residents search for real estate online, PropertyGuru has become a household name in the property-crazed city-state. Today, it’s the largest real estate marketplace in Southeast Asia with operations spanning countries including Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.(Updates with CEO’s comments and 99 Group comments from third paragraph)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ecaf3bd64510c157b15b47b8a7ae9c8ad115ea972f454ae4f0dd180470d49283

While the blank-check company will focus on south and southeast Asia, India will be of a particular focus.Murdoch, who was previously chief executive officer of 21st Century Fox Inc., and Uday Shankar, the former president of Walt Disney Asia Pacific, are co-chairmen of the SPAC, the filing shows. The announcement confirmed a Bloomberg News report in February on the listing plans.Seven Islands plans to offer 30 million units at $10 apiece, with each unit comprised of one share and a fourth of a warrant. It is expected to list on Nasdaq under the symbol “SVNI.” Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and PJT Partners Inc. are advising the offering.The 48-year-old son of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch resigned from the board of News Corp. in July last year, citing differences of opinion with the publishing company. Lupa entered India less than two years ago and has built a portfolio of technology investments, according to the filing.Murdoch and Shankar previously worked together at Star India, which became the country’s largest media company before Walt Disney took over a swath of 21st Century Fox’s assets, including Star, in 2019. Shankar worked for the Asia Pacific unit of Disney after the deal until his departure in December last year.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=fd7a35beadde5d6543aeba85ffad9f95113d4baabf46ef60bb73cd79dcd157b4

The stories don’t have ads, and Scroll shares some of the revenue from its subscriptions with the publishers.Scroll will temporarily halt new subscribers while its 13-person team joins the social media company, Twitter said Tuesday in a blog post. Deal terms weren’t disclosed. Scroll, which has offices in New York City and Portland, is backed by investors including Union Square Ventures.Twitter has spoken publicly about its interest in selling a subscription product, and is considering a number of options. The San Francisco-based company also recently acquired Revue, a newsletter startup, with plans to make money from subscriptions. Twitter envisions the two products working together, and saids users may one day pay to read newsletters or stories from certain publishers directly on Twitter without any ads.“For every other platform, journalism is dispensable,” wrote Scroll Chief Executive Officer Tony Haile in a blog post. “If journalism were to disappear tomorrow their business would carry on much as before. Twitter is the only large platform whose success is deeply intertwined with a sustainable journalism ecosystem.”The social media company is looking for ways to expand business outside of digital advertising, which makes up the bulk of revenue. Advertising can be inconsistent and Twitter said last week that ad sales got off to a slow start in 2021 thanks in part to civil unrest in the U.S. and delayed public events, like Hollywood’s Academy Awards presentation. A subscription business would offer a more steady and predictable revenue stream.Scroll is Twitter’s sixth deal in the past six months. The news reader startup was first announced in late 2016, and raised money from a number of publishers, including Axel Springer SE, News Corp. and the New York Times.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=10bed0ad87148d3978f0f6cd1360e719ef13a259f9a235a2af534dd82d86383a
