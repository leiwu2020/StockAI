company,1624878693,Ingersoll Rand to Snap up Maximus for CAD$135.4M,68764296,https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?1030336946,IR,Nasdaq,"Ingersoll Rand, Inc. (IR) inked an agreement to acquire Maximus in an all-cash transaction worth C$135.4 million, to capture the huge growth potential in the agritech and industrial water treatment end markets.



Shares of Ingersoll Rand, a global flow creation and industrial solutions company, have jumped 72% over the past year.



Based in Montreal, Canada, Maximus provides digital controls and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) production management systems for the agritech market. 



Maximus' IIoT platform connects to farm devices, simplifies facility management, tracks the status of farm infrastructure, and automates tasks based on artificial intelligence (AI) technology. (See IR stock chart on TipRanks)



Notably, Maximus has witnessed an impressive revenue CAGR of 30% over the past five years and continues to expect double-digit growth over the next five years. It recently reported annual revenue of C$40 million.



Also, Maximus is forecast to achieve adjusted EBITDA margins in line with the current momentum in the Precision and Science Technologies Segment (PST) levels.



The addition of Maximus will enhance digital connectivity to Ingersoll's Dosatron smart dosing pump system in the PST segment. The collaboration will lead to better dosing precision, efficiency, data gathering, and record keeping.



Upon integration with Ingersoll Rand’s PST segment, the company expects to achieve significant margin improvement and a high single-digit EBITDA multiple (excluding flow-through from organic growth) by the end of the third year.



Important to note, the agritech market is expected to grow by double-digits annually in the next five years. Ingersoll Rand intends to leverage both Dosatron and Maximus channels, to drive growth and gain market share with minimal customer overlap.



Ingersoll Rand’s CEO, Vicente Reynal, commented, “Smart, connected products, digital capabilities, and technology are core to our growth. Today’s announcement delivers on our commitment to deploy capital in pursuit of this strategy.”



The acquisition is expected to close during the third quarter, subject to mandatory regulatory approvals.



Robert W. Baird analyst Michael Halloran maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $61 (25.6% upside potential).



Halloran believes that IR remains a favorite pick, following the company's recent acquisition of Seepex, a manufacturer of progressive cavity pumps.



Overall, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 7 Buys and 2 Hold. The average analyst Ingersoll Rand price target of $56.67 implies 15.7% upside potential from current levels.

(IR), a provider of flow control and industrial solutions, inked a deal to buy Seepex GmbH in an all-cash transaction worth €431.5 million. Shares jumped 3.1% to close at $46.92 on June 21. 



Based in Germany, with facilities in North America and the Asia Pacific, Seepex manufactures progressive cavity pumps, which primarily serve the water, wastewater, food and beverage, and chemical end markets. The company has an annual turnover of around €160 million. 



The deal, subject to certain regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the third quarter. Upon completion, Seepex is to be combined with IR’s Precision and Science Technologies (PST) segment. The acquisition increases the PST segment’s total addressable market by 30% to approximately $7.3 billion. (See Ingersoll Rand stock chart on TipRanks)



Vicente Reynal, IR’s CEO said, “Seepex has an exceptional historic organic growth profile with a high single-digit revenue CAGR since 2017 with double-digit growth expected in 2021, supported by a solid installed base of over 210,000 pumps and recurring aftermarket business that is already above 40% of its total annual revenue.”



The company expects to yield a post-synergy Adjusted EBITDA purchase multiple of low-double digits by the third year of ownership.



Seepex possesses a solid patent portfolio including a market-ready, commercially viable digital platform that enables various digital revenue streams – from e-commerce to full-scale software as a service (SaaS). Seepex has invested around €10 million to build this platform and Ingersoll Rand plans to scale this digital capability across the whole PST segment.



Credit Suisse analyst John Walsh recently initiated coverage of the stock with a Hold rating and lifted the price target to $51 from $50, implying 8.7% upside potential from current levels.



According to Walsh, in a recent investor conference, Ingersoll Rand stated that as the COVID-19 situation comes under control, the company is on track to meet its guidance of mid-teens growth in the first half and high-single digits growth in the second half of the year.



With 7 Buys and 2 Holds, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average Ingersoll Rand analyst price target of $56.67 implies 20.8% upside potential from current levels. Shares have gained 60% over the past year.

The deal could be announced as early as Monday, it said.Platinum Equity, controlled by billionaire Tom Gores, is seeking the deal in anticipation of a rebound in golf as a recreational sport following the pandemic, Reuters said.The Davidson, North Carolina-based company’s Club Car golf, utility and consumer low-speed vehicles unit reported 2020 revenue of $246 million, up 9% from the previous period, according to its Feb. 22 earnings statement. The increase was “driven by continued strength in consumer vehicles, as well as growth in golf and after market product offerings,” according to the statement.An after-hours telephone call to Ingersoll Rand wasn’t answered, and Platinum Equity didn’t immediately respond to an email request for comment.Golf still remains a popular sport even as the outbreak kept people away from courses. Earlier on Sunday, Hideki Matsuyama won the Masters Tournament by one shot, becoming the first Japanese to claim one of the four majors in men’s golf on the lush fairways and manicured greens at Augusta National in Georgia.Platinum Equity last month kicked off a $4 billion debt sale to help fund its acquisition of supply chain company Ingram Micro Inc. amid an up tick in leveraged buyout activity.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=51f1fed8dd06176b15f3818e04817420fca0c832dbe861b1e4836448fb4988ca
