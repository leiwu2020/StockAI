Terminating aircraft leases cost Marathon $13 million during during the first three months of the year.Marathon is fielding offers for a Hawker 850XP at a time of robust demand and a shrinking pool of used corporate aircraft for sale, said Janine Iannarelli, founder of boutique jet broker Par Avion Ltd. Shale explorers are facing unprecedented pressure from investors to slash spending and return more profits to shareholders. To that end, Marathon on Wednesday doubled its 2021 debt-reduction target to at least $1 billion.Crowded PlanesMarathon’s other aircraft is leased, according to company spokeswoman Rebecca Skiba. In the past, Marathon has generally lumped aircraft obligations in with leases for drilling rigs, frack pumps and real estate.“We’re really seeing a run on inventory” of available planes, Iannarelli said. “For most makes, less than 10% of the installed base is for sale.” The pandemic has helped drive demand as commercial airlines scaled back routes and executives sought to avoid crowded spaces, she said.Marathon, the fourth-best performer in the S&P 500 this year, fell 3.6% to $11.285 at 2:39 p.m. in New York.(Updates with jet broker’s comments starting in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1f0fca3407cea5e1d2bf49fb4e56752b1f5c5bb7b4a423dcecaee387742613e5

These notes had a 2.8% coupon rate. The move reduces Marathon’s annual interest expense by $14 million. Additionally, the company raised its quarterly dividend by about 30% to $0.04 per share. The dividend is payable on June 10 to investors of record on May 19. Marathon Oil Chairman, President, and CEO, Lee Tillman said, “We have swiftly followed through on our commitment to reduce our gross debt by at least $500 million in 2021, fully addressing our next significant debt maturity, and have also raised our quarterly base dividend by over 30%.” Tillman added, “These actions are fully consistent with our objective to both further enhance our investment-grade balance sheet and return an increasing amount of capital to shareholders.” (See Marathon Oil stock analysis on TipRanks) On April 20, Raymond James analyst John Freeman reiterated a Buy rating on the stock but did not assign any price target. Marathon Oil announced preliminary CFO expectations of $610 million to $630 million for 1Q. This was higher than consensus estimates of $540 million. Freeman commented, “The CFO beat on the quarter was largely due to strong price realizations in the U.S.” Overall consensus among analysts is that Marathon Oil is a Hold based on 4 Buys, 6 Holds, and 3 Sells.
