In earnings news, the multinational computer technology corporation Oracle Corp. (ORCL) reported strong results for the fiscal fourth quarter. The company reported quarterly revenues of $11.23 billion, up 8% year-over-year, and surpassed analysts’ expectations of $11.04 billion.

Oracle CTO Larry Ellison commented, “The world’s two most popular databases are the Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle MySQL. Independent analysts have tested and confirmed that Oracle MySQL with HeatWave runs 10 to 100 times faster than Amazon's version of MySQL called Aurora. This technological breakthrough is causing several of Amazon's customers to start moving their Aurora workloads to Oracle MySQL. And industry analysts are telling us they are seeing a 10x increase in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customer inquiries. Both the Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle MySQL with HeatWave technology have captured the technology high-ground in the cloud database business-and that bodes well for the future of the Oracle Cloud.”

Wabtec's decision to deploy GM's Ultium battery and HYDROTEC hydrogen fuel cell systems further validates our advanced technology and demonstrates its versatility.”

Apple Music and Beats VP Oliver Schusser said, “Listeners can’t get enough of their favourite podcasts and want a simple way to support the extraordinary creators who make them possible. Now, listeners can enjoy new content and additional benefits for thousands of new and popular podcasts, alongside millions of free shows, with more arriving every week.”

Per the terms of the deal, 655,644 Coinsquare shares were purchased from shareholder Michael Diamond and two affiliated companies (vendors) in exchange for 378,774 shares of MOGO, along with a cash payment of $5 million. Notably, MOGO has the option to snap up another 3.4% of Coinsquare shares from the vendors until October 13, subject to certain regulatory approvals.

Origin’s expertise and technology, along with Palantir’s data integration and modeling capabilities, will focus on decarbonizing the global materials supply chain. 



Palantir’s COO Shyam Sankar said, “We are deeply energized by Origin’s meaningful progress against the world’s net zero ambition. Our platform is uniquely suited to support the decarbonization of complex global supply chains. Customers across dozens of industries are using Foundry to build a carbon-focused common operating picture that allows them to track live emissions, simulate scenarios based on emerging technologies and regulations, and make real-time changes to their business.”",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=65b1fabeec3ad5f99c69ec8219abb6d571a089ee2fbc984ff46a12cf38fffe90
company,1623820050,General Motors to Partner with Wabtec,68373474,https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?49764944,WAB,Nasdaq,"General Motors (GM) will collaborate with Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (Wabtec) (WAB). The two will work together to advance and commercialize the automaker’s battery and fuel cell technologies for use in Wabtec locomotives.



General Motors designs, builds, and sells cars. It is currently working on advancing an all-electric future that is inclusive and accessible to all.



Wabetc will merge its know-how in energy and systems optimization with GM’s advanced technologies to develop solutions for heavy haul locomotives. The automaker’s Ultium battery technology is expected to offer flexibility, efficiency, power, and reliability for use in the rail system. Its compact fuel cell power cubes can be used in several applications including locomotives. (See General Motors stock analysis on TipRanks)



Additionally, Wabtec and GM have inked a non-binding agreement through which they will advance each other’s vision of zero-emission in transportation. The development is expected to accelerate the rail industry's path to decarbonization while ensuring zero-emission from locomotives. (See  Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies stock analysis on TipRanks)



“Rail networks are critical to transportation and to GM’s ability to serve our customers across North America, and Wabtec’s bold plan to de-carbonize heavy haul and other locomotive applications helps advance our vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion,” said Mark Reuss, GM’s President.



Barclay’s analyst Brian Johnson has reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and raised the price target to $70 from $66, implying 15.1% upside potential to current levels. According to the analyst, the raising of second-quarter and full-year upper-end guidance affirms solid execution at the automaker.



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 12 Buys and 2 Holds. The General Motors average analyst price target of $70.77 implies 16.38% upside potential to current levels.



GM scores 9 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

(NYSE:WAB) share price is at $75.01, after a 4.15% gain. Moreover, over the past month, the stock fell by 6.79%, but in the past year, increased by 0.96%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is performing up to par in the current session. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 11.04%. The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.

company,1613745286,Wabtec Sees A Future Producing Battery Electric Locomotives,66486057,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PL4uyzICdC9bwPl05VrVsg--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/Benzinga/a5ce4f38d857aeee746837415c3e3508,WAB,Yahoo,"Wabtec (NYSE: WAB) could develop more battery electric locomotives in the future as prospective buyers eye ways to improve fuel efficiency, executives of the rail technology provider said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday. BNSF (NYSE: BRK-B) is conducting advanced tests on what Wabtec calls ""the world's first battery electric locomotive,"" which the Pittsburgh-headquartered rail technology provider has dubbed FLXdrive. The heavy-haul locomotive could potentially reduce fuel consumption by 10% to 30%, and the technology is attracting interest from customers in North America and internationally, according to Wabtec President and CEO Rafael Santana. Sales of the battery electric locomotive wouldn't occur immediately. Proposals are out but there have not been any sales in 2021 or 2022 as of yet, Santana said. ""Fuel is one of the biggest costs for our customers. I would say they are heavily focused on driving fuel efficiency across their operations,"" Santana told investors and analysts during Thursday's earnings call. ""This, combined with the growing focus on ESG [environmental, social and governance] and the need for decarbonization, I think positions the FLXdrive as a unique product to really address the challenges."" The prospect of producing more battery electric locomotives comes as Wabtec experienced a ""very significant drop"" in locomotive production in the fourth quarter of 2020. The company reported net income of $87.9 million, or 46 cents per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with $135.7 million, or 71 cents per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2019. ""As we go into '21, we have about a 35% reduction in locomotive volumes, which means no deliveries for North America and that's the first time it happens in decades,"" Santana said. That contributed to Wabtec's decision to undertake significant restructuring at several U.S. facilities. Wabtec also reduced employee headcount across its divisions by 12% in 2020, and it reduced its operational footprint by 10%. As 2021 progresses, the company said Wabtec and its customers expect an ""uneven yet sequential recovery"" as the global economy emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic. Wabtec's technological footprint has expanded in key regions such as the Americas, Russia, the Commonwealth of Independent States and India, and it secured a ""strategic"" international locomotive order in the fourth quarter of 2020. ""Demand for reliability and productivity will only accelerate as we continue to differentiate Wabtec in the market. Quarter-to-date, we closed a significant multiyear order for modernizations and long-term service agreements"" for modernizations, overhauls and parts services, Santana said. Wabtec is seeking to increase global interest for its positive train control (PTC) offerings, and the company said it has contracts in 2021 to install upgrades to Wabtec's Trip Optimizer systems. The ability to utilize PTC to enable autonomous trains is within reach, and technological products are available to make that leap although there might be some differences with how the Class I railroads would implement that next stage, according to Santana. ""I don't think the technology is the bottleneck,"" Santana said. FInancial results for the fourth quarter of 2020 Fourth-quarter net profit slipped 35% as lower operating expenses weren't enough to offset a decline in sales and gross profit. Net sales were $2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with $2.37 billion in the prior year amid lower sales in Wabtec's freight equipment, components, digital electronics and transit aftermarket segments. Gross profit was $505.5 million, compared with $674.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Operating expenses were $344.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with $448.8 million year-over-year.

The order also includes the supply of 372 roof-mounted air conditioning systems. Lilian Leroux, President of Wabtec’s (WAB) Transit business, commented, “This order builds upon our long-standing partnership with the MRT. The solutions Wabtec is providing for these new transit cars will improve the rail system’s operations and the passenger experience.”The company operates in two business segments: Freight and Transit and provides equipment, digital solutions, and component systems to freight and transit rail. In 3Q20, the transit business segment generated sales of $628 million and made up around 33% of the company’s total revenues. (See WAB stock analysis on TipRanks)Cowen & Co. analyst Matt Elkott last month reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $86. Following the company’s 3Q20 results in October, Elkott commented , “With another decisive beat, raised guidance, and resilient backlog, the execution turnaround remains ongoing. The NA freight recovery bodes well for the company's aftermarket business. Transit concerns are valid but a bit overblown, and a blue wave election could help. New power technologies and ESG have come to the forefront.”The rest of the Street is bullish about the stock. The Strong Buy consensus shows 4 analysts recommending a Buy. The average price target of $92 implies 14.3% upside potential to current levels. That's after shares jumped by about 11% over the past month.According to TipRanks' Smart Score system, Wabtec scores a 6 out of 10, which indicates that the stock is most likely to perform in line with market averages.Related News:MoneyGram To Expand Visa Debit Card Service In Europe; Shares Jump 7.3% IBM’s 4Q Revenues Of $20.4B Disappoint; Shares Fall 7.3% After HoursUnited Airlines Posts Wider-Than-Feared Loss of $1.9B In 4Q; Street Says Hold",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=dceb6e84f94ed6e42212695839d7307183c2307162ba50fd80512bc5e746d1ba
