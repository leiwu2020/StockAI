Once that happens, Holtec would take over ownership of the power plant and would be responsible for decommissioning and cleaning up the plant and site.Under the agreement, Holtec has to keep at least $400 million in a decommissioning trust fund for a decade and has to put half of the money it gets from the Department of Energy for spent fuel management costs into that fund.Decommissioning a nuclear power plant involves decontaminating the facility to reduce radioactivity, dismantling the structures and taking care of used nuclear fuel, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, a nuclear trade association. In January, James filed a lawsuit against the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to intervene in the decommissioning.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=41b378b285ef4b09950d7c95683751da5ff9f34bf28eab6d9795783aad1ffe43

Shares of the energy company dipped 1.3% to close at $89.97 on Feb. 24. Entergy’s (ETR) 4Q adjusted earnings increased 4.4% to $0.71 per share on a year-over-year basis and beat the Street estimates of $0.66. Revenues declined 3.7% to $2.37 billion and came in below analysts’ expectations of $2.8 billion. The company’s operating expenses came in at $2.2 billion, almost stable year-over-year. Revenues generated from natural gas operations declined 14.1% to $35.2 million. (See Entergy stock analysis on TipRanks) For 2021, the company expects adjusted EPS to land between $5.80 to $6.10, versus the consensus of $5.89. Entergy CEO Leo Denault said, “We are reporting strong results for another very successful year. Our adjusted earnings per share were in the top half of our guidance range as we exceeded our $100 million cost savings target for the year.” On Jan. 21, Evercore ISI analyst Durgesh Chopra upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold and increased the price target to $110 (22.3% upside potential) from $106, as the firm “shook up its Energy sector ratings with a cautious view on the group in the near-term and a preference for value over quality.” Longer-term, Chopra “is more constructive on the group, citing both valuation support and the view that a Biden presidency is a major tailwind for the sector.” The consensus rating among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 6 Buys and 2 Holds. The average analyst price target stands at $112.63 and implies upside potential of more than 25% to current levels over the next 12 months.

The move follows the plant's shutdown and permanent defueling in the spring of 2022.“Holtec’s plan to safely accelerate the Palisades decommissioning schedule by more than four decades provides the potential for site redevelopment much sooner than if Entergy continued to own the facility after shutdown,” said Entergy's (ETR) Chris Bakken.Holtec has set up a plan to complete the dismantling, sanitization, and remediation of Palisades to NRC regulatory standards by 2041. As part of the plan, Holtec will also provide job opportunities for around 260 of Entergy’s employees who presently work at Palisades.The application also sought approval of the license transfer of Entergy's already-decommissioned Big Rock Point facility near Charlevoix.Upon NRC regulatory approval, Holtec will take control of the Palisades site, its nuclear decommissioning trust fund, real property, and used nuclear fuel. It will also assume ownership of the Big Rock Point ISFSI property and used nuclear fuel.Holtec also submitted an exception request seeking permission for the use of the Palisades NDT (Non-Destructive Testing) for spent fuel management and site restoration activities. NDT refers to the inspection techniques that allow inspectors to collect data about material without damaging it.Palisades and Big Rock Point would join Holtec’s growing fleet of decommissioning plants upon the completion of the above procedures.On Nov. 23, the NRC approved the transfer application for the licenses for Indian Point Energy Center’s nuclear power plants from Entergy’s subsidiaries to a Holtec subsidiary for decommissioning.Mizuho analyst Paul Fremont on Nov. 17, reiterated a Buy rating on ETR stock and raised the price target from $109 to $119.Fremont was pleased with the efforts and progress the company has made in reducing costs, which in turn has helped offset the impact of Covid-19 and mild weather conditions.
