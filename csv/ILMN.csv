Business Performance and Highlights Women’s HealthThe Myriad Women’s Health business -- which serves women assessing their risk of cancer, and those who are pregnant or planning a family -- recorded revenue of $55.2 million in the quarter, a decline of 15% year-over-year. Elective testing for hereditary cancer has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to delayed elective office visits. The company’s prenatal business continued to demonstrate strong growth trends with test volumes increasing 9% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Myriad myRisk® Hereditary Cancer myRisk® Hereditary Cancer test volumes for the Women’s Health business in the U.S. declined 25% year-over-year largely due to the impact of the pandemic. Myriad Foresight® Carrier Screen and Myriad Prequel® Prenatal Screen Myriad’s proprietary AMPLIFY™ technology, which further increases the performance of its Prequel™ noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS) test, is leading to increased new prenatal users and test utilization. Since the launch of the AMPLIFY™ technology in July, Myriad has seen an increase of 12% in the total number of ordering providers for prenatal testing services, including Prequel and Foresight, with 11% growth in total test utilization per provider. OncologyThe Myriad Oncology business provides hereditary cancer testing for patients who have cancer, and products such as the EndoPredict® breast cancer prognostic test, the Prolaris prostate cancer test, and the myChoice CDx and BRACAnalysis CDx companion diagnostic tests for predicting response to PARP inhibitors. The Oncology business delivered total revenue of $75.6 million, up 39% relative to revenue in the March quarter of last year. Myriad myRisk® Hereditary Cancer myRisk® Hereditary Cancer test volumes for the Oncology business in the U.S. declined 9% year-over-year. Myriad Prolaris® Prostate Cancer Presented new data at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Conference demonstrating the Prolaris test can accurately predict which patients will benefit from multi-modality therapy. Using the newly established threshold, 27% of men with newly diagnosed high-risk disease and 73% with unfavorable intermediate-risk disease could avoid multimodality therapy. Myriad BRACAnalysis® CDx and myChoice® CDx Saw significant increases in BRACAnalysis CDx and myChoice CDx test volume in Japan with total revenue from the country increasing more than four-fold year-over-year to $11.9 million.Received new reimbursement for the myChoice® diagnostic system in Japan effective January 1, 2021. New Tumor Profiling Product: Announced new partnership with Intermountain Precision Genomics, powered by technology from Illumina (NASDAQ: ILMN), for a comprehensive offering of germline and somatic tumor testing services. The strategic collaboration combines germline genetic testing, next-generation tumor sequencing and world-class testing capabilities to elevate global precision oncology care. Mental HealthMyriad’s Mental Health business -- which consists of the GeneSight® psychotropic test that helps physicians understand how genetic alterations impact response to antidepressant and other psychotropic medications -- saw revenue of $17.6 million in the quarter compared to $20.4 million in the same period last year. Test volume for GeneSight was up 17% sequentially. Myriad GeneSight Saw a strong increase in new ordering providers with over 2,600 physicians ordering GeneSight for the first time in the quarter, up 24% sequentially. Overall, the number of ordering physicians increased 10% sequentially and test utilization per provider increased 4% sequentially despite the strong growth in new ordering providers.Published a new study in Psychiatry Research demonstrating that the combinatorial approach available in the GeneSight® Psychotropic test is better than single-gene testing at predicting patient outcomes and medication blood levels. AutoimmuneMyriad’s Autoimmune business -- which consists of the Vectra test for measuring disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis -- generated revenue of $10.7 million in the quarter compared to $10.5 million in the same period last year. Vectra® Signed a definitive agreement to sell select operating assets and intellectual property (IP), including the Vectra® test, from Myriad Autoimmune’s business unit to Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (NYSE: LH) for $150.0 million in cash.

The diagnostic will be based on Illumina's pan-cancer comprehensive genomic profiling assay, TruSight Oncology 500 (TSO 500), and will be used to detect TP53 mutations in multiple hematologic indications. The partnership will initially focus on developing a companion diagnostic for Kartos's MDM2 inhibitor, KRT-232. Kartos has several ongoing trials for KRT-232 in TP53 wild-type blood cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia, myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and B-cell malignancies. Kartos CEO and CMO Jesse McGreivy said, ""This partnership will allow us to capitalize on TSO 500 as we explore the expanded use of KRT-232, which offers a unique mechanism to restore the function of p53, one of the most critical tumor suppressor proteins, resulting in apoptosis of malignant cells across a variety of hematologic and solid tumor types."" Kartos is also studying KRT-232 in some solid tumors with TP53 mutations, such as glioblastoma, soft tissue sarcoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma. Illumina's TSO 500 is currently used only for research and can identify 523 known and emerging tumor biomarkers. The new diagnostic will be the first to use TSO 500 with peripheral whole blood as a sample type. Price Action: ILMN shares closed 1.3% higher at $408.42 on Thursday.

Learn more about Biosplice’s Board of Directors at https://www.biosplice.com/board-of-directors About BiospliceBiosplice is developing first-in-class, small-molecule therapeutics based on pioneering science of alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Stemming from foundational discoveries in Wnt pathway modulation, Biosplice has elucidated novel biology linking CLK/DYRK kinases to the therapeutic regulation of alternative splicing. Alternative splicing is an essential biological mechanism that regulates the diversification of proteins in a cell, which, in turn, determines cell type and function. Biosplice’s target class governs the selection of tissue-specific mRNA splice sites, making them attractive, druggable targets within the cellular “command and control” center. Biosplice’s drugs in clinical development include lorecivivint for osteoarthritis (in Phase 3), cirtuvivint for numerous cancers, and a broad pipeline that ranges from Alzheimer’s disease to other degenerative conditions.
