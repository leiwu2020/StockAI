Northern would also be providing custodial services to Fundsmith’s U.K. and U.S.-based funds.



As of December 31, 2020, Fundsmith held more than $45 billion in assets under management. Notably, in March, the company launched a new strategy, named Fundsmith Sustainable Equity Fund, to its Luxembourg Fund range.



Furthermore, Fundsmith will have access to Northern’s integrated trading solutions, combining worldwide trading expertise in equities and fixed income with global market reach, superior liquidity, and an integrated middle and back-office service. (See Northern stock chart on TipRanks)



Toby Glaysher, head of Global Fund Services, International at Northern, said, “Northern Trust’s technology, investor servicing and trading capabilities make us well-placed to comprehensively support Fundsmith’s business planning and range of investment strategies – and this extension of our relationship reflects the strong synergies between our organisations.”



On June 17, KBW analyst Michael Brown downgraded the stock to Hold with a price target of $128. This implies 14% upside potential to current levels.



Brown says that as the Federal Reserve recently reflected hawkish sentiments towards interest rates in its dot plot, markets might be approaching a rate hikes scenario earlier than expected. The downgrade reflects his rising rate sensitivity analysis.



Consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 4 Buys, 5 Holds, and 2 Sells. The average Northern analyst price target stands at $117.09, which implies upside potential of 4.1% from current levels. Shares have gained 18.1% so far this year.

However, many market participants still expect rates to go higher, which would knock the debt again.Chicago-based Robertson takes an opposing view on duration, which measures the sensitivity of a bond’s price to rates changes. He expects 10-year Treasuries to stay in a 1.25%-1.75% yield range for the rest of this year.“It’s extremely hard for me to see a big shift in the fixed-income markets anytime soon and investors are being too aggressive with respect to inflation expectations,” said Robertson. “Short-term rates are going to stay lower for longer than investors think.”Northern Trust doesn’t expect credit spreads to tighten much more, having already hit multi-year tights already this year, but he says the chance of them spiking is slim. Besides seeing value in BB rated bonds, Northern Trust expects CCC rated debt to perform well and prefers high-yield bonds over leveraged loans on a long-term basis.Robertson expects issuance to slow as “so many companies have done what they wanted to do.” He adds that there’s more cash in money-market funds now that needs to be invested than there was before the pandemic.“The supply demand dynamics are still fully in play, even in the face of an absolutely incredible amount of high-yield issuance,” said Robertson.Fed PropAccommodative policy, diminished default risk and a benign maturity schedule boost the case for junk credit. Robertson doesn’t expect the Federal Reserve to start thinking about tapering until July at the earliest.“The Fed has now shown too many times that they will be there to support,” Robertson said. “They can taper bond purchases and they would still be in a position where interest rates should stay anchored at zero on the short end.”The big risk to Robertson’s call is that volatile macroeconomic data are interpreted in a different way by the Fed than he expects. Nonetheless, he has high conviction in his risk-on credit call.“Not being fully invested would be the biggest mistake,” said Robertson, referring to credit markets overall.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c7c107f3abd528104d33a7a83bfa9246538d27c876d377bd1342c79bfd61fda3
