The financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.  



Shares of the hybrid cloud-data services and data management company have jumped 87.8% over the past year. (See NTAP stock chart on TipRanks)



Based in Paris, France, Data Mechanics is a managed platform provider for big data processing and cloud analytics that helps businesses capitalize on Apache Spark, an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing and machine learning.



The addition of Data Mechanics is in line with NetApp’s strategic initiative to enhance the use of analytics and machine learning. It uses them to identify operating efficiencies and automate manual processes, thereby enabling engineers to focus on more strategic tasks.



Less than a year ago, NetApp acquired Spot, a leading CloudOps provider that automates and optimizes workloads running in public cloud environments. The company plans to integrate Data Mechanics’ team with the Spot team to speed up the development of NetApp’s recently announced Spot Wave solution.



Anthony Lye, SVP and GM of NetApp's Public Cloud Services business unit commented, “Now more than ever, our customers are adopting cloud-first and cloud-native strategies that will enable them to be more agile and adaptable in the face of unprecedented data growth.” 



Speaking of the acquisition, Lye said, “Adding Data Mechanics to our existing solutions will make it simpler and more cost-effective for organizations across all industries to fully leverage Apache Spark and Kubernetes to advance their data and cloud initiatives.”



William Blair analyst Jason Ader recently upgraded the stock from Hold to Buy. Ader believes that the company deserves a “rerating” based on its robust cloud momentum.



Overall, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 9 Buys and 7 Holds. The average NetApp analyst price target of $84.92 implies 6.9% upside potential from current levels.

Salesforce, on the other hand, is the second-worst performer in the group with a decline of 16%. That trade was on display again Wednesday with the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index tumbling 2.9% while International Business Machines Corp. and Oracle advanced. The benchmark index is now trading at the lowest since Jan. 6.The rotation that’s taking place within the technology sector is a microcosm of what’s been playing out in the broader market for months as investors have poured money into smaller and cheaper companies that tend to outperform during economic recoveries.At the same time, higher Treasury yields make it harder to stomach paying up for companies whose abilities to generate comparable levels of profitability are uncertain or years in the future.“You don’t have to imagine everything going right for the Oracles of the world to make money,” said Kim Forrest, founder and chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners. “They are making money now.”Morgan Stanley said earlier this week that investors should look for bargains within less-loved sectors like technology hardware rather than bet on a broad advance for U.S. stocks, which have already priced in much of the expectations for earnings expansion and economic growth in 2021.“With index level upside limited, we think stock selection offers better return prospects,” strategists led by Mike Wilson wrote in a research note. The bank’s top picks for hardware include ATM maker NCR Corp. and data-storage company NetApp Inc.With the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries flirting with 1.5% on Wednesday, software makers Twilio Inc. and Zoom Video Communications Inc. were among the biggest decliners, falling 7.6% and 8.4%, respectively. Twilio is priced at 26 times 2021 revenue projections, while Zoom trades at 26. Oracle, which rose 0.4% to a record of $66.91 on Wednesday, has a price to projected sales ratio of less than five times.Bill Stone, chief investment officer at Glenview Trust Co., is a fan of value stocks but warned of pitfalls if companies like HP aren’t able to maintain profitability.“The worry of course is that those legacy companies maybe don’t have as bright of a future,” he said. “It’s really a cash-flow play and you hope that they can keep the cash flow in the future.”(Updates shares beginning in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=67f11f7ec0078388cd736d506b9ba716e1975954b49c1545628e67cf2593be1d

Here is Benzinga's look at NetApp's Q3 earnings report. What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS. Earnings And Revenue Based on NetApp management projections, analysts predict EPS of $1.01 on revenue of $1.43 billion. NetApp earnings in the same period a year ago was $1.16 per share. Quarterly sales came in at $1.40 billion. Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates""; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise"", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. View more earnings on NTAP The analyst consensus estimate would represent a 12.93% decline in the company's EPS figure. Sales would be have grown 1.85% from the same quarter last year. Here is how the NetApp's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past: Quarter Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 Q3 2020 EPS Estimate 0.73 0.41 1.15 1.18 EPS Actual 1.05 0.73 1.19 1.16 Revenue Estimate 1.31 B 1.15 B 1.43 B 1.46 B Revenue Actual 1.42 B 1.30 B 1.40 B 1.40 B Stock Performance Shares of NetApp were trading at $71.07 as of February 22. Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 41.17%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders are probably satisfied going into this earnings release. Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call. NetApp is scheduled to hold the call at 17:30:00 ET and can be accessed here.
