The terms of the deal have not yet been disclosed. Following the news, shares of the company gained 1.94% in Monday’s trading session and closed at $14.73.



With Determined AI’s expertise in machine learning training platforms and Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s leading AI and high-performance computing products, the acquisition is likely to lead to a greater quantum of accurate data insights into Hewlett Packard’s customers.



General Manager of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Justin Hotard, said, ""Determined AI’s unique open-source platform allows ML engineers to build models faster and deliver business value sooner without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. I am pleased to welcome the Determined AI team, which shares our vision to make AI more accessible to our customers and users, into the HPE family.” (See Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock chart on TipRanks)



On June 2, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Matthew Sheerin reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $20 (35.8% upside potential).



According to Sheerin, the company’s stronger-than-expected April quarter results are a positive sign. However, muted growth guidance in the third quarter of the fiscal year could be cause for concern.  



Consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 5 Buy, 7 Holds, and 2 Sells. The average Hewlett Packard Enterprise analyst price target of $16.71 implies upside potential of 13.4% from current levels. Shares have gained 51.7% over the past year.

Hewlett Packard is a multinational enterprise information technology company.



Following the announcement, shares of the company declined 1.5% in Tuesday’s extended trading session.



Revenues of $6.7 billion surpassed the Street’s estimates of $6.62 billion and jumped 11% from the year-ago period driven by healthy demand for its products.



Adjusted earnings came in at $0.46 per share, beating the consensus estimates of $0.42 per share, and soared 70% year-over-year.



Hewlett Packard CEO Antonio Neri said, ""We are strengthening our core compute and storage businesses, doubling down in our growth Intelligent Edge and HPC businesses and accelerating our pivot to as-a-service, while also advancing our cloud-first innovation agenda to become the edge-to-cloud platform as-a-service choice for our customers and partners.""



Neri further added, ""As businesses emerge from the pandemic and move beyond the immediate needs of COVID, digital transformation is at the forefront of their strategic initiatives. Our focus has been to accelerate our strategy in order to help our customers transform their businesses, optimize their applications and data across an increasingly distributed world, and be future ready, today."" (See Hewlett Packard stock analysis on TipRanks)



For fiscal Q3, the company expects earnings per share to be in the range of $0.38 - $0.44, versus the consensus estimate of $0.43.



For Fiscal 2021, the company has raised its revenue guidance to $1.82 - $1.94 versus the prior guidance of $1.70 to $1.88. The consensus estimate for the same is pegged at $1.84.



On May 11, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Matthew Sheerin initiated coverage of the stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $20 (24.3% upside potential).



Sheerin believes that the risk/reward profile of the company remains compelling at the current levels given an improved outlook for IT infrastructure spending.



The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 7 Buys, 7 Holds, and 2 Sells. The average analyst price target of $16.56 implies 2.9% upside potential to current levels. Shares have increased 39.7% over the past six months.



Hewlett Packard scores a 5 of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock is likely to perform in line with market averages.

They’re buying a 55.31% stake from Blackstone Capital Partners VI fund.That agreement triggered an open offer for an additional 26% stake in the Indian firm at 1,677.16 rupees apiece, which amounts to as much as 82.6 billion rupees ($1.1 billion). The offer price is a 1.1% discount to the closing share price on Friday. The stock gained as much as 6.5% in Mumbai after the offer.Blackstone’s move to increase its stake in Mphasis is in sync with the U.S. asset manager’s plans to boost investment in the South Asian nation. India is the strongest performer in the world for Blackstone and the firm intends to continue deploying large investments in the nation, Blackstone Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Stephen Schwarzman said during his visit to Mumbai in 2020.“This investment enables us to continue creating value for the long term and provide additional resources to further accelerate the company’s growth momentum,” Amit Dixit, head of India for Blackstone private equity, said in the statement. Mphasis specializes in providing cloud and digital solutions and serves 35 of the top 50 U.S. banking, financial services and insurance firms, according to the statement.Following the completion of the transactions, Blackstone is aiming to build MPhasis into a company worth $10 billion over the next four years, more than double its current valuation of about $4.4 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing internal targets. A representative for Blackstone declined to comment.Blackstone had purchased a majority stake in Mphasis in 2016 from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., paying 430 rupees per share at the time.(Updates with details about Blackstone’s plans for Mphasis in sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1758b218234dc389f941c7bb3be8c7b0063502c49e4b3bc71266eb4fbc524293
