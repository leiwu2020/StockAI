Amgen is a global biotechnology company that focuses on developing solutions to address unmet medical needs. Lumakras won accelerated regulatory approval to treat KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults. The FDA approval was based on the outcome of the CodeBreak 100 clinical trial program. Of the 2.2 million new lung cancer cases diagnosed each year globally, about 84% are of the NSCLC type. ""KRAS has challenged cancer researchers for more than 40 years with many deeming it as 'undruggable',"" said Amgen's head of research and development, David Reese.

(See Amgen stock analysis on TipRanks) Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Raymond noted that Lumakras secured early FDA approval. Raymond reiterated a Buy rating on Amgen stock with a price target of $255, which implies 7.17% upside potential. The analyst will wait for details about the drug's launch plan at the June 1 conference before making any adjustments to his estimates. “The drug's label looks about as expected, but the price of $17,900 per month is a bit lower than we had anticipated,” said Raymond. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 8 Buy, 9 Hold, and 2 Sell ratings. The average analyst price target of $244 implies 2.55% upside potential to the current price.
