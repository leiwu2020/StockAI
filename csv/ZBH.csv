The devices are placed either through smaller incisions or percutaneously. The technology uses photolithography to ensure a consistent product using cost-efficient manufacturing methods. The company has successfully met the first performance milestone in a distribution and development agreement that was signed with Zimmer Biomet last summer. In addition to acquiring the exclusive global distribution rights to NeuroOne's Evoâ¢ (Evo) patented electrode technology, the partnership also offers the potential for NeuroOne to earn back-end milestone payments if certain events are met within a specified time frame. President and CEO of NeuroOne Dave Rosa said, ""The company is quite pleased to meet this development milestone. Coupled with the announcement of our recent financing, we are confident that our partnership with Zimmer Biomet and the progress in our sEEG program position the company well to offer a unique full complement of brain recording diagnostic technology in 2021 and beyond."" The Zimmer agreement is intended to allow NeuroOne to implement the proceeds in a proposed Nasdaq uplisting, acceleration of research and development efforts, a potential second commercial product launch in 2021 pending regulatory clearance, and other general corporate purposes. NeuroOne received FDA clearance for its Evo cortical technology in November 2019. The Evo Electrode is over 7 times thinner than a silicon electrode. The flexibility and reduced volume would reduce pain and edema. The Evo's polyimide substrate has properties such as increased flexibility, reduced volume, and decreased immunological response, which should reduce signal artifacts. The single, thin tail design allows the implanted electrode tail to be tunneled through one incision, which should reduce infection risk and procedure time. NeuroOne anticipates that the replacement of current silicone electrodes with polyimide substrate electrodes for the acquisition of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) could provide enhanced clinical electrophysiological value with reduced cost. In partnership with the Mayo Clinic, Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF), and other prominent academic medical centers, the company began developing its cortical electrode technology in 2015. NeuroOne initially focused its efforts on epilepsy and intraoperative tumor monitoring markets. The company intends to continue to develop the technology in therapeutic applications for Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and pain management due to failed back surgery procedures.

The stock will then go ex-dividend 1 business day(s) before the record date. The ex-dividend date for Zimmer Biomet Holdings is set for March 26, 2021. The company's current dividend payout sits at $0.24, equating to a dividend yield of 0.6% at current price levels. The Significance Of Ex-Dividend Dates An ex-dividend date signals when a company's shares cease to trade with its current dividend payout. There is a small intermission period before the company announces a new dividend. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Most ex-dividend dates operate on a quarterly basis. Zimmer Biomet Holdings's Dividend History Over the past year, Zimmer Biomet Holdings has seen its dividend payouts remain the same and its yields trend downward. Last year on March 26, 2020 the company's payout sat at $0.24, which has returned to its value today. Zimmer Biomet Holdings's dividend yield last year was 0.86%, which has since decreased by 0.26%. Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market.

The medical devices company expects the move to contribute 50 basis points to revenue growth over a five-year period. It is anticipated to be 125 basis points accretive to EBITDA and operating margins. The spin-off is also forecasted to accelerate Zimmer Biometâs EPS growth on a pro forma basis. Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) plans to close the transaction in the middle of next year. This spinoff is expected to tap into a $21 billion combined market for spine and dental devices like dental implants and motion preservation devices. Zimmer Biomet CEO Bryan Hanson said, âAs part of the third phase of ZBâs ongoing transformation, we are changing the complexion of our business through active portfolio management in order to accelerate growth and drive value creation. For Zimmer Biomet, the transaction is an important step toward shifting our portfolio mix to higher-growth markets where we have a clear path to leadership and right to win.â Furthermore, Hanson added, âWe believe NewCo will thrive as an independent company with prioritized capital allocation to pursue strategic growth opportunities and investment strategies in the large and growing Spine and Dental markets.â The company also reported its 4Q and FY20 results on Feb. 5. Zimmer Biomet reported EPS of $2.11 in 4Q, beating analystsâ estimates of $2.06. The companyâs 4Q revenues declined by 1.9% year-on-year to $2.09 billion versus analystsâ estimates of $2.08 billion. (See Zimmer Biomet Holdings stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the spin-off and 4Q results announcement, Raymond James analyst Lawrence Keusch reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. Keusch wrote in a note to investors, âPhase 3 (portfolio management) of Zimmerâs ongoing transformation has gained visibility with the announcement of the decision to spin-off the dental and spine businesses, which is a positive.â The rest of the Street is in line with Keuschâs view with a Strong Buy consensus rating. Thatâs based on 18 analysts recommending a Buy, 1 analyst suggesting a Hold, and 1 analyst recommending a Hold on the stock. The average analyst price target of $173 implies 8.2% upside potential to current levels.
