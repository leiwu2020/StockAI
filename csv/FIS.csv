The financial technology market is expected to be worth $161.2 billion by 2026, according to an IndustryArc report.



Using the TipRanks stock comparison tool, let us compare two fintech companies, Paysafe and Fidelity Information Services, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.







Paysafe (PSFE)



Paysafe Ltd. is a specialized payments platform that facilitates transactions for businesses and consumers. The company operates across three business segments including its digital wallet segment, eCash solutions, and integrated processing segment.



When it comes to the iGaming market, Paysafe’s iGaming services are currently live in 14 states in the United States and used by 34 operators, as of December 31.



The company’s digital wallet includes brands like NETELLER and Skrill, while its eCash solutions segment includes digital currency brands like Paysafecash and paysafecard. Paysafecard supports payments across gaming merchants to accept eCash payments.



Skrill digital wallet supports a wide array of eCommerce platforms including Wix, Magento, Shopify (SHOP), and WooCommerce. The company’s integrated processing segment includes Paysafe and Petroleum Card Services brands that focus on card not present and card-present solutions for small to medium-size business (SMB) merchants.



In Q1, the company posted revenues of $377.4 million, up 5% year-over-year while net loss narrowed to $49.1 million versus a net loss of $51.1 million in the same quarter last year. The company’s adjusted EBITDA was relatively flat at $113.2 million.



At the same time, total payment volume (TPV) rose 8% year-over-year to $27.7 billion.



Late last month, Cowen & Co. Georgios Mihalos initiated coverage of PSFE with a Buy rating and a price target of $15 on the stock. Mihalos stated in a note to investors, “We see PSFE’s B2C revenue streams as a key differentiator relative to peers, with an opportunity to capitalize on the fast growing, but still nascent US iGaming opportunity.”



According to Mihalos, more than 35% of PSFE’s iGaming revenue comes from Digital Wallet and eCash, plus some from its Integrated Processing segment. The analyst wrote that the iGaming market is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 45% and will represent a total addressable market (TAM) deposit volume between $33 billion to $49 billion by 2025.



The analyst expects PSFE to benefit from the iGaming market growth “driven by even modest deposit volume penetration (single digit) and success selling gateway and value-added services to online casinos/platforms.”



Mihalos added that even if Skrill accounted for just 5% of the estimated iGaming deposit volume in 2025, it would still provide around $70 million in revenues. The analyst also expects “PSFE to supplement high single to low double digit normalized top line growth (~10%) with strategic tuck-in acquisitions to further enhance growth.”



For Q2, the company has projected revenues between $365 million to $385 million while FY21 revenue is estimated to fall in the range of $1.53 to $1.55 billion. PSFE expects adjusted EBITDA to land between $110 million to $120 million in Q2 while in  FY21, it is projected to range between $480 million to $495 million. (See Paysafe stock chart on TipRanks)



Overall, the analyst expects PSFE to deliver “~10% organic top line growth with low teens-adj.  EBITDA growth over the longer term.”



Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 6 Buys. The average Paysafe price target of $16.33 implies approximately 45.2% upside potential to current levels.







Fidelity National Information Services (S&P 500: FIS)



FIS is a provider of technology solutions for banks, merchants, and capital markets firms globally. The company operates in three business segments including merchant solutions, banking solutions, and capital market solutions.



The Merchant segment enables merchants to accept card-based payments including electronic payments, contactless cards and a mobile wallet that originates at a physical point of sale, including card-not-present payments in eCommerce and mobile environments.



The Banking solutions segment offers core processing software, transaction processing software and complementary applications and services to financial institutions and has clients in around 100 countries.



Fidelity’s capital markets solutions segment serves financial services clients with an array of buy- and sell-side solutions including applications for recordkeeping, data and analytics, trading, financing, and risk management.



FIS generates a majority of its revenues through a combination of transaction fees, software license fees and processing, technology, and professional services. The majority of the company’s international revenues is generated through clients in the U.K., Germany, Australia, France, Canada, Brazil, and India.



In Q1, FIS posted revenues of $3,223 million, up 5% year-over-year, and a diluted loss of $0.6 per share versus diluted earnings of $0.02 per share. The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.30 per share, up 2% year-over-year.



In the second quarter, FIS expects revenues between $3.36 billion to $3.39 billion while diluted EPS is expected to come in between $0.55 to $0.65 per share. In FY21, revenues are projected to vary from $13.65 billion to $13.75 billion, and diluted EPS is expected to land between $1.30 to $1.60 per share. (See Fidelity National Info Services stock chart on TipRanks)



Late last month, Mizuho Securities analyst Dan Dolev reiterated a Buy and a price target of $185 on the stock. The analyst was optimistic about FIS’s Q2 results after analyzing “US and UK card volume data shows FIS's 2Q21 merchant acquiring organic revenue growth could exceed 40%, which would offer ample upside to management's guidance of 26-31% (or 30-35% including tax shift tailwind).”



According to Dolev, in 2020, “FIS's merchant acquiring volumes grew below the blended growth of Visa's US payments volume (est. 85% of FIS mix) and UK card spend (est. 15% of FIS mix). But this was not always the case, and we expect this anomaly to slowly return to its historical trends as the US and UK economies normalize.”



The analyst used a proprietary monthly volume analysis to evaluate Visa’s expected volumes in the United States in the calendar second quarter (C2Q) and expects these to grow 41% year-over-year in C2Q.



Dolev also used the U.K.’s trade association and retail spend data to predict card volumes in the United Kingdom and expects U.K. volumes to grow 25% to 30% year-over-year in C2Q.



Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 11 Buys and 4 Holds. The average Fidelity National Info Services price target of $170.80 implies approximately 17.6% upside potential to current levels.







Bottom Line



It is important to note here that FIS is a competitor of PSFE when it comes to processing services for merchants.



While analysts are bullish about PSFE, they are cautiously optimistic about FIS. Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, PSFE seems to be a better Buy.

Cash accounted for 27.4pc of money taken at shop tills in 2019 but the pandemic halved this figure to 13.4pc last year, a report from Worldpay, the payments processor formerly owned by RBS, found. It predicted that notes and coins' share of transactions in shops would fall to 6.9pc in 2024. Last year 49pc of spending in shops was made by debit card and 21pc by credit card, Worldpay said. Other countries are turning their back on cash even more quickly, however. Norway's shoppers used cash for just 4.5pc of their in-store purchases last year, down from 13.8pc in 2019, and the report predicted a figure of just 0.9pc in 2024. Sweden was forecast to have cash usage of 0.4pc in three years' time, although its use of cash last year, 8.8pc, was higher than Norway's. France has already overtaken the UK on the road to a cashless society: its use of notes and coins was 11.8pc last year, 1.6 percentage points less than Britain's, and was forecast to be just 5.7pc in three years' time. Worldpay said cash transaction values had fallen steeply around the world in 2020: by 21.9pc in North America, by 33.6pc in Europe, by 34.7pc in Latin America and by 36.6pc in the Asia-Pacific region. It forecast that cash use would decline by an additional 38pc from 2020 to just 12.7pc of global point-of-sale volumes by 2024. ""The sun is setting faster on cash,"" the company said. ""Cards, mobile wallets and other digital alternatives were already catching up or exceeding cash at the point of sale. With the pandemic, safety concerns around cash combined with physical distancing suddenly rendered it impractical. ""Though not inherently high risk as a virus transmitter, consumer perceptions about safety persist: 53pc of global consumers surveyed by Worldpay said coronavirus made them more hesitant to use cash."" The company's Pete Wickes added: ""This research shows the speed and scale of the transformation in consumer behaviour in just 12 months. The decline in the use of cash in the UK has accelerated, and while this opens up new opportunities for businesses to optimise and drive efficiencies, we need to be mindful that important parts of the economy continue to rely on cash, such as charity donations and restaurant tip jars.""

But don’t count out those pursuing targets in other industries, such as Foley Trasimene Acquisition II (NYSE:BFT) stock. Source: Sulastri Sulastri / Shutterstock.com This SPAC’s sponsor, Bill Foley, may not have the clout of the most well-known “SPAC Impresario,” Chamath Palihapitiya. But Foley is fast becoming one of the more prolific SPAC sponsors out there. As InvestorPlace columnist David Moadel wrote in his Feb. 22 column, Trasimene Acquisition II is Foley’s fourth SPAC. The first one (CF Corp) bought Fidelity & Guaranty Life, before getting acquired by Fidelity National Financial (NYSE:FIS), a company with which Foley was already involved.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Another one, Foley Trasimene Acquisition II, has announced a merger partner: payments processor Paysafe. More important than Foley’s background is whether BFT stock can continue to climb once the Paysafe deal closes. After examining the details, I think that the shares can rise in the years ahead. BFT stock is worth buying today, but keep the risks it carries in mind. The “SPAC bubble” may be about to pop, resulting in some near-term volatility in the shares. BFT Stock and the Paysafe Deal Whenever assessing a SPAC stock that’s announced a deal, your first question should be whether the deal terms make the shares worth investing in. To determine whether BFT stock is attractive, let’s examine the details of its deal. 8 Stocks to Buy for March First, let’s look at the overview of the transaction . At today’s prices, the combined entity is valued at around $11.3 billion. Combined with the $1.8 billion of post-deal debt, the implied enterprise value of the shares is around $13.7 billion. Paysafe is expecting sales of around $1.5 billion and EBITDA of $561 million this year. In short, today’s share price implies an EV/EBITDA ratio of around 25 times. That valuation is on par with that of similar companies, like Global Payments (NYSE:GPN). Also, Paysafe expects its EBITDA to reach $669 million to $744 million by 2023, around 20%-30% above its 2021 target. That suggests that BFT stock can gain 20%-30% in the coming years. The share price probably won’t double or triple like a number of other SPACS have. But it could appreciate reasonably in the coming years. This SPAC’s Risks On the other hand, there are several reasons why going long BFT stock today may not be profitable. Firstly, the valuation of payment processing plays could contract. Right now, the rapid growth of the online sports gambling market in the U.S. is helping to justify the high valuations of payment processors But if future years bring lower-than-expected growth for online sports gambling companies and iGaming operators, it may be tough for stocks like Paysafe to keep trading at their current EBITDA multiples. Secondly, the “SPAC Bubble” may be about to burst. That could push many blank-check stocks, including ones that have already announced deals, back towards their offering prices or even lower. While there’s little investors can do about the first risk, the second one may have a silver lining. If the market gets skittish about SPACs and sells blank check stocks across the board, you may be able to take advantage of the situation and buy BFT stock at a more favorable entry point. The Bottom Line I don’t see this SPAC becoming a “meme stock” anytime soon. But, because it’s reasonably priced, it may be a solid opportunity for long-term investors. Indeed, the shares could continue to climb, assuming the online gambling industry keeps expanding in the U.S. The risks posed by the name are more general to blank-check stocks, rather than company-specific issues. All in all, consider BFT stock a buy. On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not (either directly or indirectly) hold any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
