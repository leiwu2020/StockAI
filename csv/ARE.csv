(Nasdaq: TCRR), a clinical-stage cell therapy company with a pipeline of novel T cell therapies for patients suffering from cancer, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021 and provided a corporate update. “We remain on track to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose for gavo-cel in 2021 and advance into the expansion portion of the Phase 1/2 trial where our primary focus will be efficacy as well as continuing to monitor for safety. The clinical benefit we have observed with our cancer patients gave us confidence to expand our manufacturing capabilities by establishing a commercial-scale cGMP facility in Rockville, Maryland, which we expect to come online in 2023,” said Garry Menzel, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of TCR2 Therapeutics. “In the last quarter we were also able to showcase our early-stage programs in our rich pipeline and reflect on the versatility of our TRuC-T cell platform. This included presenting our CD70-targeted autologous TRuC-T cell and our mesothelin-targeted allogeneic TRuC-T cell at AACR. As for our additional solid tumor milestones in 2021, we expect to present more complete data from the dose escalation Phase 1 portion of the gavo-cel trial, file an IND for TC-510, a mesothelin-targeted TRuC-T cell enhanced with a PD-1:CD28 switch receptor, and present preclinical data on our IL-15 enhancement, which we believe will drive even longer persistence and expression of a memory phenotype, characteristics which could be beneficial across our portfolio.” Recent Developments gavo-cel: TCR2 presented clinical and translational data from the dose escalation portion of the Company’s Phase 1/2 clinical trial of gavo-cel in patients with treatment refractory mesothelin-expressing solid tumors at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Virtual Annual Meeting. The data reported were from eight treatment-refractory mesothelin-expressing solid tumor patients and highlighted translational markers consistent with the clinical profile, including transduction efficiency, CD4:CD8 ratio, memory phenotype, expansion and persistence and cytokines. Early-Stage Pipeline TCR2 presented new preclinical data from its allogeneic “off the shelf” TRuC-T cell targeting mesothelin highlighting a lack of alloreactivity, reduced risk of host rejection, upregulation of activation markers, secretion of cytokines and clearance of tumors comparable to gavo-cel at the AACR Virtual Annual Meeting.TCR2 presented new preclinical data from its TRuC-T cell targeting CD70 highlighting T cell expansion, improved memory phenotype, significant anti-tumor efficacy in multiple xenograft mouse models with no evidence of in vivo fratricide at the AACR Virtual Annual Meeting. Corporate: TCR2 announced that it signed a long-term, full-building lease with Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (NYSE: ARE) for an existing 85,000 square foot cell therapy manufacturing facility in Rockville, Maryland which is ready for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) build-out. The site will support clinical and commercial production of gavo-cel with a capacity that is projected to treat several thousand cancer patients annually. The facility is expected to accelerate the Company’s commercial-scale manufacturing timelines with production anticipated in 2023.TCR2 announced the appointment of Aaron Vernon as Vice President of Technical Operations. Previously, Mr. Vernon held senior positions including Vice President of Global Technical Operations and Vice President of Engineering & Supply Chain at Autolus Therapeutics, where he led manufacturing capacity expansion and overseeing internal and external manufacturing of plasmid, vector and cell therapy products. Anticipated Milestones TCR2 to present additional safety, efficacy and translational data from the Phase 1 portion of the gavo-cel Phase 1/2 clinical trial for patients with mesothelin-expressing solid tumors throughout 2021.TCR2 to present an interim update from the Phase 1 portion of the TC-110 Phase 1/2 clinical trial for patients with CD19+ non-Hodgkin lymphoma or adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the second half of 2021.TCR2 plans to file an IND for TC-510, the first enhanced TRuC-T cell targeting mesothelin with a PD-1:CD28 switch, in the second half of 2021.TCR2 plans to select a development candidate for its allogeneic program in the second half of 2021.TCR2 to present preclinical data on its IL-15 enhancements program in the second half of 2021.TCR2 anticipates production of clinical trial material from ElevateBio LLC and its manufacturing facility in Stevenage, UK, both in anticipation of demand from the Phase 2 expansion trial of gavo-cel, in 2022. Financial Highlights Cash Position: TCR2 ended the first quarter of 2021 with $333.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments compared to $228.0 million as of December 31, 2020. Net cash used in operations was $19.9 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $16.4 million for the first quarter of 2020. TCR2 projects net cash use of $100-110 million for 2021, which includes tenant improvements to the Rockville facility. We expect cash on hand to support operations through 2023.R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $15.9 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $12.0 million for the first quarter of 2020. The increase in R&D expenses is primarily related to ongoing clinical trials, increase in headcount and additional lab facilities.G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $5.7 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $4.3 million for the first quarter of 2020. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs.Net Loss: Net loss was $21.5 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $15.5 million for the first quarter of 2020, driven predominantly by increased personnel expenses. Rockville Facility In March 2021, we entered into a lease for a new manufacturing facility. The landlord built an approximately 85,000 square foot rental building in Rockville, Maryland and leased the facility to the Company as a manufacturing facility for an initial term of 15 years through June 2036. Because we are involved in the construction project and are responsible for paying a significant portion of the costs of normal finish work and structural elements of the facility, the Company is deemed for accounting purposes to be the owner of the building during the construction period under build to suit lease accounting guidance under ASC 840, Leases. Therefore, the Company recorded a construction-in-progress asset and a related construction financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of property and equipment and lease financing obligations, respectively. We anticipate lease payments of $1.4 million for the remainder of 2021. About TCR2 Therapeutics TCR2 Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical-stage cell therapy company developing a pipeline of novel T cell therapies for patients suffering from solid tumors or hematological malignancies. TCR2’s proprietary T cell receptor (TCR) Fusion Construct T cells (TRuC®-T cells) specifically recognize and kill cancer cells by harnessing signaling from the entire TCR, independent of human leukocyte antigens (HLA). In preclinical studies, TRuC-T cells have demonstrated superior anti-tumor activity compared to chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells), while secreting lower levels of cytokine release. The Company’s lead TRuC-T cell product candidate targeting solid tumors, gavo-cel, is currently being studied in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to treat patients with mesothelin-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer, malignant pleural/peritoneal mesothelioma, and cholangiocarcinoma. The Company’s lead TRuC-T cell product candidate targeting hematological malignancies, TC-110, is currently being studied in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to treat patients with CD19-positive adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (aALL) and with aggressive or indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

(Nasdaq: TCRR), a clinical-stage cell therapy company with a pipeline of novel T cell therapies for patients suffering from cancer, today announced that it has signed a long-term, full-building lease with Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (NYSE: ARE) for an existing 85,000 square foot cell therapy manufacturing facility in Rockville, Maryland which is ready for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) build-out. The site will support clinical and commercial production of gavo-cel with a capacity to treat several thousand cancer patients annually. The facility is expected to accelerate the Company’s commercial-scale manufacturing timelines with production anticipated in 2023. “After observing the consistent early clinical benefit and manageable safety profile experienced by patients treated with gavo-cel, we committed to securing a dedicated U.S. manufacturing facility as the first step in building a regional network to supply cancer patients with our therapies,” said Garry Menzel, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of TCR2 Therapeutics. “Leasing an existing manufacturing footprint is a substantial milestone for TCR2, saving us valuable time and capital so that we can be ready for commercial production in 2023. Our new state-of-the-art facility will allow us to directly leverage our cell therapy process development expertise and control our end-to-end production supply chain. We are very pleased to be building a world-class cell therapy production facility for gavo-cel that will bring new hope to cancer patients suffering from solid tumors.” The 85,000 square foot facility constructed by Alexandria Real Estate Equities will provide space for commercial and clinical manufacturing, quality control laboratories and offices upon completion. TCR2 is designing the state-of-the-art cell therapy facility to utilize semi-automated and functionally closed systems which aim to provide cGMP manufacturing while optimizing the reliability of our cell therapy products and reducing manufacturing costs and vein-to-vein time. The flexible layout will allow production of gavo-cel and other emerging cell therapies in the TRuC-T cell pipeline. “The hiring of Aaron Vernon to head technical operations for the Company comes at the right time as we expand our manufacturing capabilities in anticipation of commercial production. His prior leadership roles in building out commercial operations as well as his specific expertise in global supply chain management will offer vital insights to TCR2 as we continue to execute upon our clinical strategy for gavo-cel,” added Dr. Menzel. Aaron Vernon joins TCR2 as Vice President of Technical Operations. Most recently, he held senior positions including Vice President of Global Technical Operations and Vice President of Engineering & Supply Chain at Autolus Therapeutics, a clinical stage autologous CAR-T cell therapy company, where he held numerous responsibilities including manufacturing capacity expansion and overseeing internal and external manufacturing of plasmid, vector and cell therapy products. Previously, Aaron was Vice President of Global Supply Chain and Manufacturing at Sucampo Pharmaceuticals. Earlier in his career, served in various engineering and manufacturing operations roles at AstraZeneca, MedImmune and Johnson & Johnson. About TCR2 Therapeutics TCR2 Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical-stage cell therapy company developing a pipeline of novel T cell therapies for patients suffering from solid tumors or hematological malignancies. TCR2’s proprietary T cell receptor (TCR) Fusion Construct T cells (TRuC®-T cells) specifically recognize and kill cancer cells by harnessing signaling from the entire TCR, independent of human leukocyte antigens (HLA). In preclinical studies, TRuC-T cells have demonstrated superior anti-tumor activity compared to chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells), while secreting lower levels of cytokine release. The Company’s lead TRuC-T cell product candidate targeting solid tumors, gavo-cel, is currently being studied in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to treat patients with mesothelin-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer, malignant pleural/peritoneal mesothelioma, and cholangiocarcinoma. The Company’s lead TRuC-T cell product candidate targeting hematological malignancies, TC-110, is currently being studied in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to treat patients with CD19-positive adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (aALL) and with aggressive or indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

Shares closed at $170.59 on Tuesday.Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 0.9 million additional shares. The offering is expected to close by Jan. 8, 2021, subject to closing conditions.The real estate investment trust said that the net proceeds from the offering will be used to finance pending acquisitions, including 401 Park Drive, 201 Brookline Avenue and a related future development opportunity in the heart of the company's Greater Boston life science cluster market. The remaining proceeds will be used for general working capital and other corporate purposes, including the reduction of the outstanding balance on the company's unsecured senior line of credit and commercial paper program.UBS analyst Brent Dilts recently initiated coverage on the stock with a Hold rating and a price target of $166 (2.7% downside potential).According to Dilts, the company's accelerating fundamentals in its core lab/tech markets are offset by slowing demand from the tech and other traditional office tenants that make up 19% of ARE's tenant base. (See ARE stock analysis on TipRanks)Meanwhile, the stock scores a cautiously optimistic outlook from the rest of the Street. The analyst consensus of a Moderate Buy is based on 1 Buy and 1 Hold. The average price target of $175 implies 2.6% upside potential at current levels.Related News:Tuesday’s Pre-Market: Here’s What You Need To Know Before The Market OpensViewRay Prices $50M Public Offering; Shares Drop 13%Brookfield Asset Management To Take Property Unit Private In $5.9B Deal",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=eb634ee91b92caf2791d89bae84c1eddcc0ca0c456155185ccb37830f3a517d5
