With the integration of Fortinet Secure SD-WAN and Google Cloud’s Network Connectivity Center (NCC), we are offering customers the unique opportunity to secure the cloud on-ramp into the cloud, between clouds and within the cloud. At the same time, Fortinet offers the best quality of experience of applications, regardless of where the application is deployed.” News Summary Fortinet® (NASDAQ: FTNT), a global leader in broad, integrated and automated cybersecurity solutions, today announced an integration of the company’s industry leading Fortinet Secure SD-WAN to the Google Cloud Network Connectivity Center (NCC).

Fortinet is delivering the most complete and simplified cloud on-ramp experience through its Secure SD-WAN solution. Securing Multi- and Hybrid Clouds that Enterprises Rely On Over 90% of enterprises employ multi- and hybrid clouds, allowing their applications to reside anywhere – from on-campus to branch to data center to cloud. Where these applications reside should be transparent to the end user.

As a result, it seamlessly provides behavior-based protection, detection and response at both pre-infection and post-comprise stages as demonstrated in the recent MITRE ATT&CK Evaluation results. In the past year, FortiEDR customer adoption grew more than 300 percent. This advancement in endpoint security is critical to defend against the sophistication and maliciousness of recent high profile cyberattacks and evolution of ransomware.” News Summary Fortinet® (NASDAQ: FTNT), a global leader in broad, integrated and automated cybersecurity solutions, today announced enhancements to the company’s FortiEDR solution, whose customer adoption has been growing exponentially. These include new MITRE ATT&CK tags for system activity, new managed detection and response (MDR) service options and the recently announced extended detection and response (XDR) capability. With the latest additions, organizations of all sizes can now benefit from advanced endpoint protection with automated endpoint detection and response (EDR), including: Cloud-native Endpoint Security: Helps secure workers’ computers on and off the network, providing visibility into and reduces the endpoint attack surface with a lightweight agent whose operation is transparent to users.Integrated Endpoint Protection (EPP) with EDR: Not only does this approach prevent attacks pre- and post-execution, but can also detect threats that bypass the prevention layer and quickly respond to minimize business impact.Managed detection and response (MDR) service: Delivers 24x7 threat monitoring, alert triage, remote response and environment tuning for additional expertise and insight.no mis Increased Demand for Real-Time Protection to Thwart Threats like Ransomware Ransomware attack trends continue to evolve and impact more and more organizations. From the middle to end of last year, FortiGuard Labs saw a sevenfold increase in volume of attacks. As modern ransomware attacks place data and lives at risk, organizations need to secure their environments and to protect critical infrastructure. To address these challenges, FortiEDR, as part of the Fortinet Security Fabric, delivers patented ransomware protection without any dependency on shadow copies that the more sophisticated cyberattacks disable. Additional patented detect and defuse capabilities thwart other classes of advanced threat while maintaining high availability even in the midst of a security incident. This also buys valuable time needed for full incident response. Protecting Against a Sophisticated Threat Landscape with FortiEDRUnlike other endpoint protection solutions that rely on known threat intelligence to block attacks or blunt tools for detection and response, FortiEDR provides durable behavior-based protection and ongoing analysis and automatable response that can roll back malicious changes without taking machines offline to re-image. Additionally, FortiEDR’s incident response playbooks enable organizations to easily pre-define common response actions based on endpoint groups, asset value and threats categorization. This allows companies to take a risk-based approach to endpoint security, and speed the incident response process. As proven by the latest MITRE test, FortiEDR leverages patented code tracing technology to track all system activities, identify at-risk behavior and step in to block before damage is done. FortiEDR can then also unwind the damage and restore the system. This approach is more accurate, decreasing false positives, more durable as its harder to evade, and able to detect novel and zero day threats, including supply chain attacks. Customers Flock to FortiEDR for Customizable and Automatable Response and Remediation Actions Here’s what customers have to say about selecting FortiEDR to identify and stop breaches in real-time automatically and efficiently. “As our infrastructure team was looking to protect our 330 servers housed in two data centers, the FortiEDR endpoint detection and response capabilities stood out. The solution’s advanced protection capabilities to detect potential threats in real time and automate threat response procedures with customizable playbooks was something we were looking for. We have peace of mind knowing that we have the Fortinet endpoint solutions in place, and the managed service is an additional safety net.”- Joe Kuehl, District Technology Manager, Millard Public Schools “With FortiEDR and the Fortinet Security Fabric, our security infrastructure will automatically block and tackle. In our legacy environment, if our endpoint solution detected something, internal staff had to enter it on the MSP’s help desk portal. It would take at least half a day for remediation efforts to begin, with a day or more until resolution. In contrast, if FortiEDR detects an issue, it will cut it off right away. The time to response is almost immediate. Also, because FortiEDR ties into the rest of the Fortinet Security Fabric, we will gain a better line of sight to our endpoints. Fortinet offers great technology at a great price, with great visibility across the whole stack.”- Shaun Guthrie, Senior Director, IT, Alberta Urban Municipalities Association (AUMA) Additional Resources Watch how Fortinet makes possible a digital world you can always trust.View how the Fortinet Security Fabric platform delivers broad, integrated, and automated protection across an organization’s entire digital infrastructure.Learn more about FortiGuard Labs global threat intelligence and research and the FortiGuard Security Subscriptions and Services portfolio.Read more about how Fortinet customers are securing their organizations.Learn more about Fortinet’s free cybersecurity training, an initiative of Fortinet’s Training Advancement Agenda (TAA), or about the Fortinet Network Security Expert program, Security Academy program, and Veterans program.Engage in the Fortinet User Community (Fuse).

In addition, as we expand services in the cloud, more network edges are created, even at the branch level. This has expanded our potential attack surface, making security an even greater concern. Fortinet’s security-driven networking approach with Secure SD-WAN and SD-Branch enabled us to reduce our connectivity costs and increase the level of security and visibility of both our remote branches and industrial networks.” News Summary Fortinet® (NASDAQ: FTNT), a global leader in broad, integrated, and automated cybersecurity solutions, today announced that ENGIE Italia, a global energy and services group, has implemented Fortinet Secure SD-WAN and SD-Branch to securely connect 120 offices and operational sites. Further, Fortinet, a leader in operational technology (OT) security, was able to help ENGIE Italia improve its OT team’s visibility and control across the entire network, resulting in better collaboration between the IT and OT teams, quicker response times to incoming threats, and a seamless approach to network security across the branches in Italy and abroad. The Challenge of Exponential Branch Site Growth ENGIE is global energy player whose mission it is to accelerate a carbon neutral economy. Remote sites are an important asset to the business and it is a larger national infrastructure with more than 120 remote branches. ENGIE’s existing MPLS network structure was complex and inhibited overall visibility of the network. Collaboration between the IT and OT teams was a challenge due to the remote nature of some of the sites and the merging of new teams. Therefore, ENGIE looked to Fortinet Partner Wellcomm Engineering S.p.A. to help standardize the network and security of these remote sites. The goal was to handle the shift of services to the cloud and reduce traffic backhauling to the data center in favor of local internet breakouts and more IT/OT team collaboration. The Power of Convergence with Security-driven Networking To solve these challenges and improve the visibility and security of their remote branches and industrial networks, ENGIE chose to implement Fortinet Secure SD-Branch with help from Wellcomm Engineering S.p.A. This new branch architecture consisted of FortiGate Next-Generation Firewalls, FortiAP access points, and FortiSwitches. By deploying FortiGate NGFWs, FortiAPs and FortiSwitches at the central sites of Milan and Rome and in the branch offices across other regions, ENGIE provides local internet access at remote sites and leverages integrated Secure SD-WAN capabilities to give remote users the ability to directly access trusted cloud resources such as Microsoft Office365 and Salesforce. The Fortinet SD-Branch solution also enabled ENGIE to simplify its hardware ecosystem, centralizing and automating remote management of both security and networking with FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer. More Visibility and Collaboration for IT and OT Teams As a result of this centralized management, ENGIE was able to balance traffic flows through the local firewall at the first pilot site in Bari, in both the branch office and call center. With more visibility across the remote branches, ENGIE can now separate out the guest network from its internal IT network, mitigating risk and allowing the detection of suspicious activities in real-time. ENGIE was also able to dismantle the secondary MPLS carrier in late 2019 to reduce wide area network (WAN) costs. In addition, the OT team is also able to leverage the IT infrastructure, gaining more insights than ever before. The teams are now able to identify devices on the network much faster and troubleshoot issues in seconds thanks to the perspective FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer have given them. These changes have facilitated better collaboration and information sharing between ENGIE’s IT and OT teams, resulting in quicker response times to incoming threats and a seamless approach to network security across its branches in Italy. By designing security into its infrastructure and centralizing management via Fortinet Secure SD-Branch, ENGIE’s IT and OT teams alike can ensure faster and more efficient workflows in their increasingly connected OT environment. John Maddison, EVP of Products and CMO at Fortinet “As organizations like ENGIE Italia look to enable their remote branches and locations with all of the power and potential of digital transformation, they often find that they need to rethink their WAN strategy. Fortinet’s SD-WAN and SD-Branch solution, which converges security and networking, was able to help improve connectivity between branch sites, but also enable IT and OT team collaboration which was important in order to minimize security risks.” About ENGIE Italia ENGIE Our Group is a global leader in energy and low-carbon emission services.

Refer to the Forward-Looking Statements section below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our guidance with respect to non-GAAP financial measures excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets and gain on intellectual property matter. We have not reconciled our guidance with respect to non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures because certain items that impact these measures are uncertain or out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. 1 A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.

FTNT-F Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding demand for our products and services, guidance and expectations around future financial results, including guidance and expectations for the second quarter and full year 2021, statements regarding the momentum in our business and future growth expectations and objectives and statements regarding growth in market demand. Although we attempt to be accurate in making forward-looking statements, it is possible that future circumstances might differ from the assumptions on which such statements are based such that actual results are materially different from our forward-looking statements in this release. Important factors that could cause results to differ materially from the statements herein include the following: general economic risks, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; negative impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic on sales, billings, revenue, demand and buying patterns, component supply and ability to manufacture products to meet demand in a timely fashion, and costs such as possible increased costs for shipping and components; global economic conditions, country-specific economic conditions, and foreign currency risks; competitiveness in the security market; the dynamic nature of the security market and its products and services; specific economic risks worldwide and in different geographies, and among different customer segments; uncertainty regarding demand and increased business and renewals from existing customers; uncertainties around continued success in sales growth and market share gains; actual or perceived vulnerabilities in our supply chain, products or services, and any actual or perceived breach of our network or our customers’ networks; longer sales cycles, particularly for larger enterprise, service providers, government and other large organization customers; the effectiveness of our salesforce and failure to convert sales pipeline into final sales; risks associated with successful implementation of multiple integrated software products and other product functionality risks; risks associated with integrating acquisitions and changes in circumstances and plans associated therewith, including, among other risks, changes in plans related to product and services integrations, product and services plans and sales strategies; sales and marketing execution risks; execution risks around new product development and introductions and innovation; litigation and disputes and the potential cost, distraction and damage to sales and reputation caused thereby or by other factors; cybersecurity threats, breaches and other disruptions; market acceptance of new products and services; the ability to attract and retain personnel; changes in strategy; risks associated with management of growth; lengthy sales and implementation cycles, particularly in larger organizations; technological changes that make our products and services less competitive; risks associated with the adoption of, and demand for, our products and services in general and by specific customer segments, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; competition and pricing pressure; product inventory shortages for any reason, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; risks associated with business disruption caused by natural disasters and health emergencies such as earthquakes, fires, power outages, typhoons, floods, health epidemics and viruses such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and by manmade events such as civil unrest, labor disruption, international trade disputes, international conflicts, terrorism, wars, and critical infrastructure attacks; tariffs, trade disputes and other trade barriers, and negative impact on sales based on geo-political dynamics and disputes and protectionist policies; any political and government disruption around the world, including the impact of any future shutdowns of the U.S. government; and the other risk factors set forth from time to time in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), copies of which are available free of charge at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov or upon request from our investor relations department. All forward-looking statements herein reflect our opinions only as of the date of this release, and we undertake no obligation, and expressly disclaim any obligation, to update forward-looking statements herein in light of new information or future events. COVID-19 Impact While the broader implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees and overall financial performance remain uncertain, we have seen certain impacts on our business and operations, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and capital and financial resources. Going forward, the situation is uncertain, rapidly changing and hard to predict, and the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material negative impact on our future periods, including our results for the three months ending June 30, 2021, our annual results for 2021, and beyond. To highlight the uncertainty remaining for the three month period ending June 30, 2021, it should be noted that, due to customer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed quarterly quotas, we have historically received a substantial portion of each quarter’s sales orders and generated a substantial portion of each quarter’s billings and revenue during the last two weeks of the quarter. If we experience significant changes in our billings growth rates, it will impact product revenue in the current quarter and FortiGuard and FortiCare service revenues in subsequent quarters, as we sell annual and multi-year service contracts that are recognized ratably over the contractual service term. In addition, the broader implications of the pandemic on our business and operations and our financial results, including the extent to which the effects of the pandemic will impact future results and growth in the cybersecurity industry, remain uncertain. The duration and severity of the economic downturn from the pandemic may negatively impact our business and operations, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and capital and financial resources in a material way. As a result, the effects of the pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We have provided in this release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial and liquidity measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with peer companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures provided in the financial statement tables below. Billings (non-GAAP). We define billings as revenue recognized in accordance with GAAP plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period, less any deferred revenue balances acquired from business combination(s) during the period. We consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors because billings drive current and future revenue, which is an important indicator of the health and viability of our business. There are a number of limitations related to the use of billings instead of GAAP revenue. First, billings include amounts that have not yet been recognized as revenue and are impacted by the term of security and support agreements. Second, we may calculate billings in a manner that is different from peer companies that report similar financial measures. Management accounts for these limitations by providing specific information regarding GAAP revenue and evaluating billings together with GAAP revenue. Free cash flow (non-GAAP). We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment and excluding any significant non-recurring items, such as proceeds from intellectual property matter. We believe free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after capital expenditures and net of proceeds from intellectual property matter, can be used for strategic opportunities, including repurchasing outstanding common stock, investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet. A limitation of using free cash flow rather than the GAAP measures of cash provided by or used in operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash and cash equivalents balance for the period because it excludes cash flows from significant non-recurring items, such as proceeds from intellectual property matter, investing activities other than capital expenditures and cash flows from financing activities. Management accounts for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures and other investing and financing activities on the face of the cash flow statement and under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K and by presenting cash flows from investing and financing activities in our reconciliation of free cash flow. In addition, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use free cash flow, may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure. Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin. We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus stock-based compensation, impairment and amortization of acquired intangible assets, less gain on intellectual property matter and, when applicable, other significant non-recurring items in a given quarter, such as non-recurring gains or losses on litigation-related matters. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by GAAP revenue. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the items noted above so that our management and investors can compare our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income instead of operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes the items noted above. Second, the components of the costs that we exclude from our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that peer companies exclude when they report their non-GAAP results of operations. Management accounts for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP net income and diluted net income per share. We define non-GAAP net income as net income or loss plus the items noted above under non-GAAP operating income and operating margin. In addition, we adjust non-GAAP net income and diluted net income per share for gains or losses on investments in privately held companies and a tax adjustment required for an effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis, which differs from the GAAP effective tax rate. We define non-GAAP diluted net income per share as non-GAAP net income divided by the non-GAAP diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors for the same reasons that we use non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a more complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we include in non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted net income per share, the tax adjustment required resulting in an effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis, which often differs from the GAAP tax rate. We believe the non-GAAP effective tax rates we use are reasonable estimates of normalized tax rates for our current and prior fiscal years under our global operating structure. The same limitations described above regarding our use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted net income per share. We account for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted net income per share and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted net income per share together with net income or loss and diluted net income per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.

With the scale, pace and variety of cyberthreats continuing to grow at an alarming rate, BT will be enhancing its Managed Firewall service with the addition of Fortinet Secure SD-WAN, providing multi-national organizations with a solution that fully combines security and connectivity in a single appliance. BT experts support customers at every stage of deployment and operation, from initial set-up and roll-out through ongoing monitoring, management and enhancement. BT provides a consistent level of service for organizations’ differing digital maturity, infrastructures and business needs. With all functions managed as a single entity, it allows customers to simply add devices and infrastructure to their network, giving them flexibility and agility to respond to market changes and growth. Through continuing threat assessment and detection, BT can also support customers by identifying and preventing attacks, and mitigate damages should a breach occur. Fortinet Secure SD-WAN provides a number of clear benefits, including: Improved Performance and Experience: Can be configured to prioritize business-critical traffic and real-time services for optimized network and application performance, while also accelerating the adoption and integration of cloud services.Efficient Operations: Customers can manage all sites, troubleshoot and enable Secure SD-WAN to new and existing branches easily using a single-pane-of-glass interface.Natively Integrated Security: Combines SD-WAN and security capabilities in a unified solution to preserve the security and availability of the network.Reduced Costs and Improved ROI: By deploying a single integrated security and network WAN Edge solution which enables accelerated convergence, customers benefit from both reduced costs and improved return on investment. BT and Fortinet have worked as partners for over a decade to develop and deliver solutions for organizations looking to secure their network transformation. With many organizations continuing to adapt to a distributed and remote workforce model, BT and Fortinet work collaboratively to provide customers with secure access to applications and workloads, while extending zero trust controls from their network to the Cloud Edge via SASE.

Through our Training Advancement Agenda (TAA) we’re working to solve the cyber skills gap by offering training, connecting professionals to employers and forging partnerships to bring untapped talent into the industry. We continue to see the impact of this agenda carried out largely through our NSE Training Institute programs."" News Summary Fortinet® (NASDAQ: FTNT), a global leader in broad, integrated and automated cybersecurity solutions, is continuing to make significant progress in helping close the skills gap through the NSE Training Institute programs and its Training Advancement Agenda (TAA). By increasing the access of training, developing cybersecurity career pathways and connecting individuals to employers, the NSE Training Institute is making big strides in advancing TAA efforts. The NSE Training Institute continues to grow globally, serving IT and security professionals and underrepresented populations. In addition to recently expanding NSE offerings, including the extension of more than 30 free, self-paced technical training courses, the NSE Training Institute welcomes new global partners working alongside Fortinet to close the cybersecurity skills gap, including Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS), Stanford University and University of California, Berkeley. The Skills Gap Remains a Top Challenge for Organizations The cyber skills gap is a top concern for CISOs as it helps contribute to security risks and the opportunity for bad actors to exploit vulnerabilities when strained security teams are short staffed. The Fortinet Network Security Expert (NSE) Training Institute – comprised of the Certification Program, the Security Academy Program, the Veterans Program, Authorized Training Centers and the Information Security Awareness and Training Service – was established to address the widening cyber skills gap plaguing the industry. For the first time since the NSE Training Institute’s establishment in 2015, the industry saw a decrease in the number of security professionals required to fill the gap in 2020 with a shrinkage from 4.07 million professionals needed to 3.12 million professionals according to an (ISC)2 report. While this demonstrates progress toward solving the issue, the gap is still a significant challenge for organizations of all sizes. Fortinet Creates Opportunities Through Training, Certifications and Partnerships To address the skills gap challenge, Fortinet’s NSE Training Institute offers a number of different programs to individuals at all stages of their cybersecurity career. The TAA leverages several NSE offerings to close the cyber skills gap through training and certifications, career opportunities and partnerships. Below are some recent NSE Training Institute milestones: Partnering with organizations focused on women, minorities and veterans: The growth of Fortinet’s NSE Training Institute includes partnerships with organizations focused on women and minorities, like WOMCY Latin America, Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS), Women in Tech based in France and the International Consortium of Minority Cybersecurity Professionals (ICMCP). Through the NSE Training Institute, Fortinet is also partnering with nonprofits, most recently including Hire Heroes USA, to help veterans and military families. These partnerships bring untapped candidates into the cyber workforce by providing them with opportunities for training, certifications and connecting them with the Fortinet employer ecosystem.Providing Fortinet curricula to students: Through the Security Academy Program, Fortinet supports almost 400 institutions in more than 85 different countries and territories. These academic institutions range from students in K-12 all the way to higher education and research institutions. New participants that have recently become Authorized Security Academies include: Stanford University, University of California, Berkeley, University of Arkansas (UALR), Francisco Gavidia University in El Salvador, University of Costa Rica, U-tad University in Spain, Women in Tech based out of France, Collège Communautaire du Nouveau-Brunswick (CCNB) in Canada, Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT) in Canada, Tower Australian College, Tennessee College of Applied Technology in the US and the University of Benghazi. Through the program, institutions are given access to Fortinet’s NSE Certification Program content to integrate into their own curriculum, along with exam vouchers for those who complete the course, in order to prepare students for a career in cybersecurity and help develop the next-generation of cybersecurity professionals. Free NSE Training courses reach more than 1,000,000 registrations: Recently, Fortinet announced the extension of all its advanced self-paced courses available free of charge to continue developing the world’s cyber workforce. The free cybersecurity training courses first introduced in early 2020 offer more than 30 self-paced, technical courses on critical topics ranging from Secure SD-WAN to Operational Technology to cloud security. There have been more than 1,000,000 registrations for these free courses to date. It leverages courses that count toward (ISC)2 CPE Submitter Program and the NSE Certification Program, Fortinet’s eight level certifications from cybersecurity fundamental education courses (NSE 1-3), technical product training (NSE 4-6), advanced solution-based training (NSE 7) and the cybersecurity expert recognition (NSE 8). Fortinet’s Information Security Awareness and Training Service is also offered to organizations free-of-charge, aimed at helping companies better educate their workforce on how to identify and protect themselves and their organizations against all types of cybersecurity threatsRaising cyber awareness in young children: Fortinet recently released a children’s book designed to further increase cyber awareness amongst children ranging from 7 to 12 years old. The book “Cyber Safe: A Dog’s Guide to Internet Security” was co-authored by Renee Tarun, Deputy CISO at Fortinet.Charting new education pathways: Fortinet has developed education pathways to further facilitate the transition into a career in cybersecurity and close the skills gap. The education pathways were created to help align Fortinet training and certifications with roles defined in the Cybersecurity Workforce Framework developed by National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), a part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Fortinet has defined four pathways for learners in some of the most critical areas in the industry: security operations, security-driven networking, adaptive cloud security, and zero-trust network. Delivering expert training via Fortinet and our Authorized Training Centers: Fortinet Authorized Training Centers (ATCs) provide a global network of training facilities that deliver expert-level training in local languages. Fortinet has more than 80 ATCs worldwide and is continuing to expand the locations of the training center partners to further the reach of NSE training. Fortinet’s ATCs are currently teaching in 72 countries and territories and can deliver training and local cultural support in 22 different languages. New NSE courses and updates launched in 2021: New courses have been added to the NSE library, including NSE 5 FortiEDR 4.2, FortiAnalyzer 6.4 and FortiManager 6.4. A new technical course focused on OT security which outlines how to design, implement, and operate an OT security solution based on Fortinet products has also been added. These courses are all available as self-paced as well as instructor-led and can be taken with Fortinet or one of our ATCs. Customers are also able to book private training sessions online that are customized for their organization and delivered through a virtual classroom application.Continued collaboration on Cybersecurity Learning Hub: As a founding partner of World Economic Forum’s Centre for Cybersecurity, Fortinet continues to build on its partnership with Salesforce.com and WEF on the Cybersecurity Learning Hub initiative. The Cybersecurity Learning Hub leverages NSE 1 and 2 courses to create free courses to further address the global skills gap issue. Together, Fortinet and the Cybersecurity Learning Hub have created four badges to cover the topics of Personal Digital Security, Cybersecurity Threat and Threat Actors, Digital Asset Security and Cloud Security Engineering. Recognized award-winning cybersecurity training curriculum: The NSE Training Institute was recently recognized with four industry awards, including: Gold for Best Cybersecurity Education Provider (North America) from the 2021 Cybersecurity Excellence AwardsGold for Cybersecurity Training (North America) from the 2021 Cybersecurity Excellence AwardsGold for Security Training and Educational Programs from the Globee 2021 Cyber Security Global Excellence Awards®Silver for Cyber and Info Security Marketing Campaign of the Year from the Globee 2021 Cyber Security Global Excellence Awards® Supporting Quotes “We are delighted at U-tad to join the Fortinet Security Academy Program to further prepare our students with the specialized skills to solve the cybersecurity challenges companies are facing today, making them a very attractive asset for the industry.

The book “Cyber Safe: A Dog’s Guide to Internet Security” was co-authored by Renee Tarun, Deputy CISO at Fortinet. The release of this children’s book further builds on Fortinet’s NSE 1 and NSE 2 training courses’ focus on basic cyber awareness and an overview of threat actors and their tactics. These two courses – part of the eight-level NSE Certification Program – are free for anyone interested and is for all ages including young children.The children’s book takes readers on a journey to learn how the Internet is a useful place, and how to stay secure. Lacey, the cyber smart dog teaches her friend Gabbi the cat how to use the Internet safely.With a strong focus on seeding cybersecurity education at all levels, Fortinet will make copies of the book available to elementary and middle schools across the country to instill a strong foundation of cybersecurity at an early age as part of the NSE Training Institute’s initiatives to close the skills gap. Instilling Foundational Cyber Awareness Knowledge from an Early AgeA year into the pandemic and many students are still learning virtually. With the onslaught of new devices on the home network linking students to teachers, threat actors have identified an open opportunity to execute ransomware attacks, target specific devices to steal information and compromise public school districts’ security defenses. Young children are especially a vulnerable target for cyber criminals due to their little understanding of all the bad actor tactics and methods and the detrimental impact of falling victim to these actors. With the influx of online activity, it’s crucial for both parents and children from an early age to know basic cybersecurity best practices as many continue in a hybrid capacity through the end of this school year and into the next. “Cyber Safe: A Dog’s Guide to Internet Security” provides an easy to understand introduction to possible dangers for children connecting online for school, video games, streaming shows and more. For parents, the book includes a parent’s guide with details on what they should be aware of when their children are online. To purchase the book, please visit here. NSE Training Institute’s Cyber Awareness Courses Through the NSE Training Institute, Fortinet offers cyber awareness courses via NSE 1 and NSE 2 that can further develop foundational cybersecurity skills, complementing the “Cyber Safe” book lessons. Fortinet established the NSE Training Institute in 2015, comprised of the NSE Certification Program, the Security Academy Program – which is aimed at bringing cybersecurity education to academic institutions – and the Veterans Program, as well as programs focused on global nonprofits. In 2020 the NSE Training Institute also launched the Information Security Awareness and Training Service available for free. This service can be used by any organization, including schools, to bring cybersecurity awareness to their non-technical staff. To get started on NSE 1 and NSE 2, you can sign up here.

The “Cyber Safe” book by Renee Tarun made cybersecurity a relatable topic and enjoyable to read at the same time. We would like to start including the book as part of our mandatory Cybersecurity Awareness training and hand it out to all of our elementary students when they are issued a new device at the start of the school year.”- Troy Neal, Executive Director, Cybersecurity and Technology Operations from Spring Branch Independent School District ""This is an artful, amusing, and accurate description of the dangers of unprotected Internet access. The book makes it easy to take pro-active measures to protect children and their parents against cyber-harms. It is an enjoyable read that will give educators the language to help students use the Internet responsibly and safely.""-John Windhausen Jr., Executive Director of Schools, Health & Libraries Broadband Coalition “The complex concepts addressed in the “Cyber Safe” book are important for both children and parents. The book gives enough information to create interest and understanding in children. One aspect I really liked about the book was a focus on safety and how things such as a child’s identity information and others in a young person’s orbit can compromise this. Telling the security story through identifiable characters will help younger internet learners to see information security from a new perspective.”-Bob Turner, CISO at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Additional Resources Read Renee Tarun’s blog for more information about the children’s book.Find out how the Fortinet Security Fabric platform delivers broad, integrated, and automated protection across an organization’s entire digital infrastructure.Learn more about FortiGuard Labs threat intelligence and research and the FortiGuard Security Subscriptions and Services portfolio.Learn more about Fortinet’s Network Security Expert (NSE) Training Institute, including its free cybersecurity training initiative, the NSE Certification Program, Security Academy Program and Veterans Program.Read more about how Fortinet customers are securing their organizations.Engage in the Fortinet User Community (Fuse).

company,1616689106,Fortinet: Strong Cybersecurity Player But Too Expensive Compared To Its Competition,66489923,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MMryaA4isLbWNXZAfhAODQ--~B/aD01Mzk7dz0xMDI0O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/tipranks_452/e5ebd80514c00787620e2429692b199d,FTNT,Yahoo,"Investors are often drawn to high-growth darlings, or companies that excel in one specific niche. Within the cybersecurity industry, Wall Street darlings include companies such as CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD) and Okta, Inc (OKTA), which offer solutions in endpoint security and identity management, respectively. But these companies don't address the entire spectrum of potential security threats, and customers typically end up with multiple disparate security applications that are not coordinated, providing attackers with ample opportunity to exploit weaknesses. Fortinet, Inc. (FTNT) addresses the above concerns with Fortinet Security Fabric, a broad platform that covers the entire digital attack surface, including clouds, endpoints, users, and third-party app integration. The platform operating system is FortiOS. In Q4'20, the company released version 7.0, with 300 new features including zero trust access, a feature that serves as a replacement for VPN. In addition to software and services, Fortinet also sells FortiGate security appliances as part of the overall platform strategy. The appliances provide Next Generation Firewall (NGFW), which filter network traffic to protect from internal and external threats. They are powered by the company's custom SPU NP7 network processor, an ASIC that provides an advantage in terms of speed and cost of implementation. Fortinet is also making a push into the secure software-defined wide-area networking (SD-WAN) market. Financial Performance Fortinet's broad cybersecurity platform has driven strong results in 2020 amidst the pandemic, as the company had annual revenue growth of 20%, with it reaching $2.6 billion in sales for 2020. In addition to strong revenue growth, the company was also quite profitable, with net income growth of 24.1% year-over-year in Q4 and free cash flow margin of 35%. The bottom-line performance gives the company a strong balance sheet, with cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion. Management guided for year-over-year revenue growth of 18% for both 2021and Q1'21. Historically, the company has provided conservative guidance and it typically beats on revenue by 2%-3%, so it is reasonably safe to assume revenue growth will be in the 20+% range. Recent Events Fortinet recently announced a registered public offering of $1.0 billion senior notes, $500.0 million due in 2026 and $500.0 million due in 2031. Between existing cash and the planned cash raise, Fortinet will have ample capital for new strategic investments and acquisitions that will keep the company at the leading edge of cybersecurity. It appears that the first strategic investment has already occurred with this week’s announcement that Fortinet will make a $75 million investment in Linksys, a company that provides router connectivity solutions. This move is intended to address the security challenges involved with home networks that are now part of the work-from-home phenomenon. Competition There are four dominant players in the network security industry: Cisco (CSCO), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Check Point (CHKP), and of course Fortinet. Check Point has a phenomenal free cash flow margin of 55%, but it has anemic revenue growth of 4%. Only Fortinet and Palo Alto Networks appear to be capturing market share. Both companies have similar financial metrics, with annual revenue growth of approximately 20% and free cash flow margin above 30%, making both exceptional investment opportunities. That being said, it appears that the market is pricing Fortinet stock somewhat higher than Palo Alto Networks, based on Fortinet's elevated price/sales ratio of 10.7 versus Palo Alto Networks' 8.3, potentially making Palo Alto Networks the more attractive investment. Wall Street’s Take From Wall Street analysts, Fortinet earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 12 Buys, 9 Holds, and 1 Sell. Additionally, the average analyst price target of $181.80 puts the upside potential at 7%. (See Fortinet stock analysis on TipRanks) Summary And Conclusions Fortinet is a company that is not as sexy as some of its cybersecurity peers such as CrowdStrike and Okta. But Fortinet fulfills a corporate need for comprehensive protection from cyber-attacks, which is demonstrated by consistent 20+% revenue growth over the years. This company is not only growing fast, but also has a strong free cash flow margin of 35%. Palo Alto Networks is the only competitor that can match its financial metrics. While Fortinet appears to be an attractive investment, it is a little overvalued at present with a price/sales ratio of 10.7.

Our partnerships go beyond the technologies that enable service offerings that drive growth and profitability. We’ve received outstanding feedback about the partner program to date and want to continue enhancing it to meet customers’ evolving needs as well as digital innovations. Today we are announcing updates that will help our partners to further reap benefits from the Engage Partner Program and to set themselves apart with customers.” News Summary Fortinet® (NASDAQ: FTNT), a global leader in broad, integrated and automated cybersecurity solutions, today announced updates to the Fortinet Engage Partner Program, enabling additional flexibility and revenue growth for partners. Fortinet is adding new consumption models for a range of products including FortiSIEM and FortiEDR, enhancing benefits for cloud partners and introducing new Specializations focused on growing markets. Engage 2.0 Partner Program Expands BenefitsWith hybrid workforces, highly distributed network infrastructures and new digital innovations, organizations find that securing all their environments is becoming increasingly complex if they don’t have the right technology and trusted advisors to lean on. To further enable channel partners to address these customer needs, the Engage 2.0 Partner Program will now include: New Consumption Models: Fortinet is continuing to enable MSSP and SP partners to build services and grow their business leveraging the Fortinet Security Fabric with new consumption models for FortiSIEM, FortiEDR, FortiClient, FortiSOAR, FortiAI and FortiDeceptor. According to Gartner, by 2024, more than 90% of buyers looking to outsource to security services providers will focus on threat detection and response services. Fortinet has seen an uptake of our consumption offerings, which continues to grow significantly as partners take advantage of tapping into this market demand for threat detection security outcomes. With more and more customers looking for flexible consumption models, the introduction of new ways to consume Fortinet’s end point solutions enable MSSPs and SPs to offer their customers new security services that can be quickly deployed and at lower costs.Enhanced Cloud Partner Benefits: The Engage Partner Program allows partners to engage as an integrator, MSSP or cloud partner.
