Shares of the diversified energy company have gained 17% over the past year.



In addition to the retention of their current shares, DTE shareholders will receive one share of DT Midstream common stock for every two shares of DTE held.



The stock dividend, subject to certain regulatory approvals, is payable on July 1 to shareholders of record on June 18.



DTE Energy CEO Jerry Norcia, commented, “Following the separation, DTE will be a best-in-class predominantly pure-play utility that is well positioned to continue delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy and significant value creation.”



He further added, “DT Midstream will also be poised for success and value creation with numerous growth opportunities as a premier, independent midstream company with assets in premium basins connected to major demand markets.”



Fractional shares of DT Midstream will be aggregated and sold in the open market. The resulting proceeds will be used to make cash payments to DTE shareholders who would otherwise receive a fractional share of DT Midstream common stock. (See DTE stock analysis on TipRanks)



DT Midstream common stock is expected to trade temporarily on a “when-issued” basis on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “DTM WI” from June 17.



However, from July 1, DT Midstream will begin regular trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “DTM”.



Notably, from June 17 to July 1, DTE shareholders who sell their shares will also be selling their entitlement to receive DT Midstream common shares in the distribution.



On May 27, Mizuho Securities analyst Anthony Crowdell increased the price target on DTE from $139 to $146 (6.3% upside potential) and reiterated a Buy rating.



Crowdell believes in the DTE pure-play story following the completion of the expected spin-off of the midstream business. He further estimates DTE to trade at superior multiples based on its balanced regulatory jurisdiction and limited equity needs. 



Overall, the stock has a Hold consensus rating based on 3 Buys, 6 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $142.44 implies 3.7% upside potential from current levels.

Barry Electric Generating Station tower over the Mobile River, belching steam into the Alabama sky. The sprawling complex of coal and natural gas plants already spews more than 7.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent every year. Now it's about to get even bigger, with a seventh unit estimated to cost $635 million by the time it starts service in 2023.The new gas plant, and others like it, has a 40-year lifespan. That means it will still be there in 2035, the year that President Joe Biden has promised a zero-emission electricity sector, and in 2050, the deadline set by its owner, Southern Co., to reach carbon neutrality. It could even burn past 2060, more than a century after the first coal facility opened on the site — making the complex a testament to the endurance of fossil fuels.The decision by one of the biggest U.S. power companies to develop new fossil fuel assets is hard to square with a low-carbon future. But it’s not unusual. At least eight large utilities in the U.S. are building new gas plants right now, and another five are thinking about doing the same. That lays bare an uncomfortable truth about the sector’s commitment to fighting climate change: All those carbon-neutral pledges don’t necessarily mean quitting fossil fuels. “It seems like false advertising or greenwashing,” said Drew Shindell, a professor at Duke University who studies climate change. “We can’t be building gas infrastructure in the 2020s and 2030s. We need to be closing it down.”If all of the plants under consideration moved forward, they would release nearly 35 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year, according to calculations by BloombergNEF.(1)That’s about the same as the annual tailpipe emissions of every car in Florida.Power companies explain their commitment to gas by arguing that it’s both necessary for electric reliability and an important bridge to transition from coal to cleaner energy sources. California learned that the hard way. Over the past five years, the state retired enough gas capacity to power 6.8 million homes, and had to resort to rolling blackouts last summer when a heatwave taxed the electric grid just as solar waned at sunset.“Cloud cover comes and goes,” said Katharine Bond, vice president of public policy and state affairs at Dominion Energy Inc. “The winds slows. We've got to have something that we can ratchet up.” Dominion, which has a 2050 net-zero pledge and is required by Virginia to be 100% carbon free by 2045, is also considering building a new natural gas-fired plant.To offset pollution from the new facilities, Southern, Dominion and others say they plan to invest, eventually, in technology to capture and dispose of their emissions, or rework those facilities to burn cleaner fuels such as biogas or hydrogen made from renewable sources. But neither of those strategies has been implemented at scale, and both remain uneconomic at today’s prices. Notably, almost none of the companies have laid out a timeline or budget for upgrading or transitioning their gas plants. Two of them, DTE Energy Co. and Xcel Energy Inc., acknowledge that their carbon goals rely on technology that doesn’t currently exist.(2)Southern’s new Barry plant “will support us getting to 2050” because it’s designed for both carbon capture and mixing in hydrogen, said Chief Executive Officer Tom Fanning. Right now, those technologies don’t make sense financially but “when it’s in the money, we’ll absolutely add that in.” It’s a worldwide phenomenon. The Spanish utility giant Iberdrola just finished building over $1.6 billion worth of gas plants in Mexico, though it vows to be carbon-neutral by 2050. French multinational electric utility Engie SA plans to build four new gas-fired plants in Belgium by 2025. Europe’s biggest utility, Enel SpA, pledged zero emissions by 2050 and also plans to build new gas plants in its home market, Italy, where they can replace coal stations. All of those countries have set goals to neutralize greenhouse gas by 2050, meaning that many utilities appear to be setting themselves up as potential obstacles to international climate commitments. In the U.S. alone, about 36 gigawatts of new gas generation is coming online in the next five years, according to BNEF.That raises questions about the nation’s ability to meet its own climate targets. Fossil fuel-based electricity is responsible for 25% of U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions, second only to the transportation sector — so achieving a carbon-free economy hinges on overhauling the power sector. But of the nearly two dozen U.S. utilities aiming for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, most aren’t on track to meet the goal, according to a September report by Deloitte LLP.The Biden administration has indicated it's skeptically eyeing new fossil fuel plants as part of its quest to decarbonize the power sector by 2035. ""There are a couple hundred natural gas units that are in the pipeline, and we have to think about those,"" White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy said Tuesday at a Columbia University energy summit.The electric industry is one of the easiest to clean up, thanks to the proliferation of inexpensive renewable energy. Not only has the cost of building wind, solar and batteries plunged in recent years, but those sources of energy have zero emissions and zero fuel cost: sunshine and air are free.“Renewables are now the most competitive energy sources,” said Jim Thomson, Deloitte’s U.S. leader of power, utilities and renewables.But cost isn’t always a prime concern for power companies. Most big utilities are regulated by state agencies that generally allow them to pass capital costs onto their customers. A natural gas plant built today will get funded by ratepayers and earn the company a return, even if it gets shuttered early or replaced by cleaner sources later. Buying power from a wind or solar developer isn’t always as attractive, while building renewables doesn’t always come naturally for utilities long accustomed to fossil fuels.“The thing that provides the most reliability and the lowest rates for customers is not the same thing that makes the utility money,” said Charles Teplin, a principal at RMI.Duke Energy Corp., the nation’s biggest electric utility by customer count, is weighing as many as 15 new gas units even as it commits to eliminating emissions by 2050. If the company moves forward with the buildout — which is just one of six proposals Duke has laid out — it would aim to meet its climate goals by retiring those plants after 25 years instead of 40.That prompted Duke customers Apple, Facebook and Google to complain to regulators that the new plants could become a “financial albatross” weighing on them for decades to come.Duke’s head of resource planning, Glen Snider, said gas is necessary to transition away from coal while greener technologies develop. “We don't want to be sitting still while we're waiting for these other technologies like batteries and small nuclear reactors,” he said, adding that new technologies also have risks that could add costs to ratepayer bills. U.S. utilities have so far announced plans for over $70 billion-worth of new gas-fired power plants through 2025 — almost all of which will cost more than equivalent clean energy, according to a 2019 RMI report. Those plants will be uneconomic to operate starting in about 2035 as the cost of carbon-free power keeps falling, the report said.“Utility leaders who have experience with natural gas plants are going to find that to be their go-to reliability plan,” said Miriam Wrobel, who advises utilities as part of her work for FTI Consulting's power and renewables practice.Many utilities say that their new gas plants could burn some hydrogen alongside natural gas to reduce emissions. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the biggest municipal utility in the U.S., is building a plant in Utah that’s expected to run on 70% gas and 30% clean hydrogen when it starts up in 2025. The company says it would increase the proportion of hydrogen to 100% by 2045 to meet a California law that mandates zero-carbon electricity by that date.While so-called green hydrogen that's produced without emissions is expected to be cheaper than natural gas by 2050 in many parts of the world, that won’t be the case in the U.S. due to the nation’s abundance of the fossil fuel, according to BNEF. And, for now, there isn’t any pipeline infrastructure that can safely transport hydrogen from the few areas where it may be produced to the plants where it will be used. Meanwhile, systems that capture carbon before it’s released into the atmosphere continue to have high capital costs, despite decades of research and federal funding. Most existing U.S. projects are deployed by oil companies that sell the carbon for use in enhanced oil recovery. But barring big advances in industrial utilization of carbon — such as in the production of cement — emissions captured at a power plant would likely have little commercial value even as they generate storage and transportation costs.Another option for meeting climate goals that utilities are increasingly turning to is simply selling the infrastructure later on to companies that haven’t pledged to cut carbon. Oil companies including BP Plc have already started offloading their most-polluting assets in a bid to meet their ambitious climate targets. Drax, a U.K. power producer that recently won 15-year agreements to build three new gas plants, has since said it may sell those facilities to meet its goal of being carbon negative by 2030.“We call it resource shuffling,” said Leah Stokes, a professor at University of California at Santa Barbara who studies energy and climate change.But potential buyers are already drying up as investors grow increasingly wary of fossil-fuel assets. Iberdrola, for example, has struggled to find someone to take its gas plants in Spain. Globally, the shift toward clean energy could cost companies $100 billion in stranded gas assets, according to calculations by Global Energy Monitor. “There is a cost to customers,” said Scotiabank utility analyst Andrew Weisel. “Customers will need to double pay for the gas plant and the renewable technology that replaces them.”— With assistance by Dave Merrill, Nicholas Steckler, Rachel Morison and Jennifer Dlouhy (Adds comment from White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy in 12th paragraph.)(1) Calculation uses an emissions capacity factor of 0.38.Carbon dioxide emissions per coal-fired power plant were calculated by dividing the CO2-equivalent output of all U.S. coal-fired power (1.19 billion tons) by the number of operating plants in 2018 (367). That equates to 3.25 million tons of CO2-equivalent emissions per coal facility. This is the same methodology used by the Environmental Protection Agency in itsGreenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator.(2) While both companies said their climate goals rely on technology that doesn't currently exist, DTE said in a statement that its new gas plant will help the company reduce carbon emissions by replacing a coal plant that generates 70% higher emissions per kilowatt hour. Xcel emphasized that gas will help the utility shut coal plants earlier and that new, greener technologies will be brought online as they become available.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1bd11ef9dfa23dd989b14d10bdbb4bc8089b00a5ed22c774f34b67282ab0f117

(“DT Midstream”), the new independent, publicly traded company that is expected to be formed through the planned spin-off of DTE Energy’s non-utility natural gas pipeline, storage and gathering business, intends to offer senior notes (the “Notes”), subject to market conditions and other factors. The Notes will be issued by DT Midstream and guaranteed by certain of DT Midstream’s subsidiaries. DT Midstream intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes for the repayment of short-term borrowings due to DTE Energy. The Notes are being sold in a private placement to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States under Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws. This press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes, nor shall there be any sale of the Notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. DT Midstream has filed the Form 10 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the planned spin-off. Completion of the spin-off is subject to final approval by DTE Energy’s Board of Directors, the Form 10 registration statement being declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission, regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions. Under the separation plan, DTE Energy shareholders will retain their shares of DTE Energy stock and receive a pro-rata dividend of shares of DT Midstream stock. The separation transaction is expected to be tax-free to DTE Energy and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

This release also contains forward-looking statements about DTE Energy’s intent to spin-off DT Midstream and DTE Energy’s preliminary strategic, operational and financial considerations related thereto. The statements with respect to the separation transaction are preliminary in nature and subject to change as additional information becomes available.

Turbines at DTE Energy's Pinnebog Wind Park in Huron County, Michigan. Pinnebog Wind is part of DTE Energy's MIGreenPower program. Detroit, May 18, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Indigo Lavender Farms, a family-owned lavender farm and popular agritourism destination, today announced its enrollment in DTE Energy’s MIGreenPower program. Located in Imlay City, Indigo Lavender Farms is the first farm to enroll in the program. MIGreenPower allows DTE Electric customers to reduce their carbon footprint by attributing their energy use to Michigan wind and solar projects. Indigo Lavender Farms was founded in 2015 by owners Trish and Greg Dennis. In its first three years, the farm grew from 4,000 lavender plants to 14,000 plants on 23 acres of land. The farm has become one of the most popular agritourism destinations in Michigan, drawing hundreds of visitors a day during the summer months. In addition to walking among the lavender fields, guests can picnic and buy plants, visit the greenhouse, and purchase broad array of lavender products while at the property. Recently, the farm added honeybee hives onsite, producing 65 gallons of honey a season. Trish Dennis believes in naturally sustainable farming and works to use best practices for the lavender and honeybees. The business has plans to add a rainwater collection system, install its own windmill, and make natural fertilizer by composting teas. Enrolling in MIGreenPower was a simple, affordable way for Indigo Lavender Farms to build on its current sustainable practices and help combat climate change on a larger scale. “All the things we’re doing now are great for our own private use and sustainability, and we pride ourselves on that,” said Dennis. “But we also want to be a part of a bigger project, a bigger story. MIGreenPower allows us to contribute toward the development of new clean energy projects in Michigan – some of which are really close to home for us.” Indigo Lavender Farms joins over 350 Michigan businesses and 30,000 residential customers who are using MIGreenPower to help meet their sustainability goals and reduce their impact on the environment. The program ranks among the top three voluntary renewable energy programs in the United States and has prominent business subscribers including General Motors, Ford Motor Company, the University of Michigan, Bedrock Detroit, and the Detroit Zoo. “Enrolling in MIGreenPower helps businesses like Indigo Lavender Farms reduce their carbon footprint without installing or maintaining any additional infrastructure on their property,” said Brian Calka, director of DTE’s Renewable Solutions team. “We are glad to be part of Indigo Lavender Farms’ sustainability journey and we welcome them to our program.” In the future, Indigo Lavender Farms has plans to expand to 50 acres and add more types of flowers such as tulips, daffodils, sunflowers, and chrysanthemums so the farm has flowers blooming spring through fall. The company’s lavender products are sold at the farm, at select local retailers, on the company’s website, and through both Etsy and Amazon.

Copper Hop opened its doors just three months before the coronavirus pandemic hit. At the time, the brewery only featured indoor seating for 84 people. Co-owner Ryan Balicki, together with business partners Jeremy Lewis and Shaun Koltuniak, had to quickly pivot to create an outdoor seating area and invest in outdoor heaters. Now, business is booming, and the brewery has even stimulated further development in the area. Protecting the environment is a key focus for Copper Hop Brewing. Since its opening, the business has launched various sustainability initiatives, including recycling the water used in the brewing process and sending used grain out to local farms to be used as cattle feed. “I believe making our business more sustainable is simply the right thing to do,” said Balicki. “MIGreenPower gives us a no-maintenance, flexible way to reduce our carbon footprint. It’s also great to know that we’re contributing toward the development of renewable projects in Michigan.” DTE is Michigan’s leading renewable energy producer and investor, with 18 wind parks and 31 solar farms generating enough clean energy to power 670,000 homes. MIGreenPower gives subscribers the opportunity to participate in these renewable energy projects while reducing their impact on the environment. Copper Hop joins over 300 businesses and nearly 30,000 residential customers who are helping create Michigan’s clean energy future with MIGreenPower. “We’re thrilled to have Copper Hop as our first brewery using MIGreenPower to reach its sustainability goals,” said Brian Calka, director of DTE’s Renewable Solutions team. “With three distilleries already enrolled, we know how effective the program can be in helping offset the impact of such energy-intensive processes. The MIGreenPower team is excited to continue working with southeast Michigan businesses to make a real difference in the fight against climate change.” For more information on DTE’s MIGreenPower program, please visit www.migreenpower.com.

The 2,159-panel array is located on the roof of the Deck 400 parking structure. Detroit, May 05, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Installation at parking garage of Ford Research & Engineering CenterBattery storage system will power onsite EV chargersPanels will generate 1,127 megawatt hours of clean energy, avoiding 880 tons of CO2 DETROIT, May 5, 2021 – DTE Energy today announced that it has commissioned a new solar array at the Ford Research & Engineering Center in Dearborn, Michigan. The 2,159-panel array is located on the rooftop level of the Deck 400 parking structure. The array includes an integrated battery storage system and will be used to power newly installed electric vehicle (EV) chargers. The solar array can generate 1,127 megawatt hours of clean energy, which has the environmental benefit equal to the carbon sequestered by nearly 980 acres of U.S. forests in one year.* The new solar array is just one of several steps both companies are taking to reduce carbon emissions. In 2019, Ford became the first corporate customer to enroll in DTE’s MIGreenPower voluntary renewable energy program. Through the program, Ford is purchasing 525,000 megawatt hours annually of Michigan wind energy from DTE’s Isabella and Fairbanks wind parks. ""We are pleased to once again collaborate with DTE Energy to bring more efficient, renewable energy sources to our campuses,"" said Dave Dubensky, chairman and CEO, Ford Motor Land Development Corporation. ""This is yet another example of our shared commitment to building a more sustainable future."" DTE is Michigan’s largest producer of renewable energy. The company’s 18 wind parks and 32 solar arrays generate enough clean energy to power 670,000 Michigan homes. Through its MIGreenPower program, the company offers customers the opportunity to attribute up to 100% of their energy use to the company’s wind and solar projects. “This is the third solar array we’ve constructed with Ford, and we want to thank them for their ongoing partnership,” said Trevor Lauer, president of DTE’s electric company. “Between the growth in the EV market and the transformation we are seeing in the energy sector, I believe we will begin to make real progress in the fight against climate change.” As DTE works to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, the company plans to continue adding clean energy projects to its portfolio. DTE plans to double its generation capacity from wind and solar by 2023 with the addition of one new wind park and five large solar installations. By the end of 2023, DTE’s renewable energy portfolio will include more than 2.2 million solar panels.

This program aims to help the company balance energy demand on the grid while moving closer to its environmental goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. DTE Smart Charge is a Demand Response (DR) program that will monitor and study EV charging and peak usage events. The program is looking for 1,000 volunteer EV owners who have the potential to earn up to $100 in gift cards depending on their participation level. This initiative is open to all Michigan residents who have a qualifying EV and receive residential electric service from DTE Energy. DTE is among one of a few energy companies in the U.S. running this type of program. Participating automakers include General Motors and Ford Motor Company. During peak energy usage, DTE and the automakers will temporarily pause charging to the EV owner’s vehicle; these pauses are called events. EV owners can opt-out of events at any time. Evaluating how participants and vehicles respond to the different event times and lengths will help DTE improve electric service reliability in the future as EV adoption increases across Michigan. DTE Smart Charge leverages the Open Vehicle Grid Integrated Platform (OVGIP) which enables the management of EV charging from multiple automakers in a grid-friendly and EV driver-centric manner. A joint initiative between the energy and automotive industries, OVGIP allows energy companies to address the entire electric vehicle ecosystem through a single, unified, and open interface. It also provides benefits to EV owners by allowing them to take advantage of utility incentives through improved grid capacity utilization without inconveniencing the EV driver’s schedule. “DTE is excited to play a leading role in this sustainability collaborative,” said John Boladian, Director of Energy Efficiency at DTE. “We are working to ensure the energy grid can continue to facilitate the charging needs of EV users across our electric company’s service territory today, and for years to come.” “We believe in a future with zero tailpipe emissions and know the best way to achieve that is by putting everyone in an EV,” said Alex Keros, lead architect of EV infrastructure and charging at General Motors. “We are bringing 30 new EVs to market globally by 2025 and can help to benefit the grid by optimizing charging times to non-peak hours. We’re excited to offer Chevrolet Bolt EV customers access to the DTE Smart Charge program.” Matt Stover, global director of electric vehicle charging and energy services at Ford Motor Company, said, ""We know charging remains a barrier to mass electric vehicle adoption and providing smart and seamless charging solutions will support a smooth transition to an EV lifestyle. Working with forward-thinking utilities such as DTE in Ford's home state of Michigan will help customers save money and manage their charging impact on the grid, helping to stabilize energy availability for all."" As new EV and OVGIP technologies move forward, DTE will continue to be a leader in researching ways to blend our energy management expertise with those of leading automakers and other innovative companies to move closer toward the goal of reducing carbon emissions.

Operating earnings for the first quarter 2021 were $473 million, or $2.44 per diluted share, compared with 2020 operating earnings of $320 million, or $1.66 per diluted share. Operating earnings exclude non-recurring items, certain mark-to-market adjustments and discontinued operations. Reconciliations of reported earnings to operating earnings are included at the end of this news release. “We are off to a strong start in 2021,” said Jerry Norcia, DTE Energy president and CEO. “Our employees continue to deliver – supporting the needs of the communities we serve while delivering improved reliability and service to our customers.” Norcia noted the following accomplishments: Recognized as a Gallup Great Workplace for ninth consecutive year: DTE Energy was recognized by Gallup for the ninth year in a row as a workplace with exceptionally high employee engagement – in the top 5% of Gallup’s worldwide database of companies. Awarded grant to Habitat for Humanity: The DTE Energy Foundation funded critical home repairs for people in western and northern Michigan, providing protection from the state’s harsh elements and seasonal weather patterns. Supported Detroit Means Business: DTE supported a fundraising effort to help small businesses in Detroit grow past the pandemic. Its Foundation announced a half million dollar grant. DTE is also offering personal protective equipment, technical assistance and opening resources to elevate the small business support ecosystem.Launched CleanVision Natural Gas Balance program for gas customers: CleanVision offers customers a way to affordably offset 25% to 100% of greenhouse gas emissions from an average home’s natural gas use and is the first program in the nation to include both carbon offsets and renewable natural gas. This voluntary program for gas customers is similar to DTE’s MIGreenPower program for electric customers. Issued third green bond: $1 billion in bonds will finance green, or clean, energy investments, including renewables and energy efficiency programs. In its initial green bond offering in May 2018, DTE became one of the first investment-grade energy companies in the nation – and the first company in Michigan – to issue green bonds. Developed Charging Forward eFleets: The five-year, Phase 2 Charging Forward program will accelerate electric fleet adoption in Michigan and help fleet owners reduce barriers of transitioning to eFleets; efficiently integrate charger load with the DTE Electric distribution system; and pilot new clean technologies. DTE will provide electric vehicle education, advisory services and infrastructure for commercial and business fleets. This effort, part of the company’s clean energy journey, supports economy-wide solutions to carbon reduction.Announced more than $100,000 in grants to help Michigan emergency food banks: The DTE Foundation provided meals to Michiganders as food insecurity continues due to COVID-19. Within the past year, the Foundation has awarded more than $2 million to address food insecurity.Continued progress toward DT Midstream spin-off: Announced the executive team who will lead DT Midstream upon closing of the separation transaction, expected mid-year. The team brings a diverse set of backgrounds and energy experience to the business. DT Midstream is among the first in its sector to announce a 2050 net zero carbon emissions goal, with plans to achieve 30% of this reduction in the next decade. Outlook for 2021 DTE Energy reaffirms 2021 operating EPS guidance of $6.88 - $7.26. “Our first quarter results give us confidence in meeting our financial goals this year,” said David Ruud, DTE senior vice president and CFO. “The spin of our midstream business is progressing as planned and we believe this transaction unlocks significant value for investors of both companies, as DTE becomes primarily a pure-play utility and DT Midstream launches as an independent, C-Corp midstream company.” This earnings announcement and presentation slides are available at dteenergy.com/investors.

Use of Operating Earnings Information - DTE Energy management believes that operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company’s earnings from ongoing operations and uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, DTE Energy uses operating earnings to measure performance against budget and to report to the Board of Directors. In this release, DTE Energy discusses 2021 operating earnings guidance. It is likely that certain items that impact the company's 2021 reported results will be excluded from operating results. Reconciliations to the comparable 2021 reported earnings guidance are not provided because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of specific line items (i.e. future non-recurring items, certain mark-to-market adjustments and discontinued operations). These items may fluctuate significantly from period to period and may have a significant impact on reported earnings. DTE Energy also discusses Adjusted EBITDA in slide presentations. The reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA as projected for full-year 2021 is not provided. DTE Energy does not forecast net income as it cannot, without unreasonable efforts, estimate or predict with certainty the components of net income. These components, net of tax, may include, but are not limited to, impairments of assets and other charges, divesture costs, acquisition costs, or changes in accounting principles. All of these components could significantly impact such financial measures. At this time, DTE Energy is not able to estimate the aggregate impact, if any, of these items on future period reported earnings. Accordingly, DTE Energy is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for Adjusted EBITDA. The information contained herein is as of the date of this release.

The 24,000 acres of forest included in this program span 14 counties; 13 counties in Michigan and one in Wisconsin. In addition to protecting these forests, the preservation program also acts as a filter for hundreds of waterways, streams and tributaries in the project area as well as protecting the habitats of several endangered species. The partnership is part of DTE’s Natural Gas Balance, a voluntary customer program to neutralize greenhouse gas emissions through a combination of carbon offsets and renewable natural gas. “This is the first time that we’ve seen a utility make this level of commitment to an improved forestry management program,” said Benjamin Massie, Vice President of Environmental Markets for Bluesource. “DTE’s commitment to these 24,000 acres ensures that its landowner, who could aggressively harvest the trees on their property, instead committed to significantly reduce or eliminate harvesting on their property.” In January, DTE began inviting customers to join the company’s journey to net zero through membership in Natural Gas Balance. DTE Gas’ ambitious 2050 net zero plan includes suppliers and customers, as well as its own gas operations. This clean energy commitment, combined with customer participation in sustainability programs like Natural Gas Balance and energy efficiency programs, could reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by more than 6 million metric tons by 2050 — the equivalent of offsetting natural gas emissions of 1 million homes or taking 1.3 million cars off the road annually. “By helping to preserve Michigan’s forests through our Natural Gas Balance program, DTE customers not only support the removal of greenhouse gases, but also protect one of Michigan’s greatest natural assets,” said Matt Paul, president and COO of DTE Gas.

Now the program that delivered these results, DTE’s Energy Efficiency Assistance (EEA), has earned an award from the Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance (MEEA) recognizing its efforts to keep energy affordable for thousands of the company’s most in-need customers. “DTE has made significant and measurable contributions to the well-being of many of their most vulnerable customers,” said Stacey Paradis, MEEA executive director. “MEEA applauds their efforts, thanks them for their dedication, and wants to share their caring approach to meet customer needs with others through the recognition of this award.” DTE invested over $23 million across 2019 and 2020 in program incentives to support single family, income-qualified customers with the help of community action agencies and nonprofit organizations across Michigan. The EEA program served approximately 4,700 limited income customers in 2019 and another 5,000 in 2020. The program achieved over 50,000 MCF net gas savings and 75,000 MWH in net electric savings in 2020 alone. “The DTE EEA initiatives are helping those hit hardest from job loss due to COVID-19 layoffs,” said John Boladian, director of Energy Efficiency at DTE. “COVID-19 certainly impacted 2020, but our partner community organizations were resilient and quickly ramped up to meet the need once it was safe to do so. During a crisis like this pandemic, DTE strives to be a beacon of hope in the community for the many families impacted by COVID-19.” In 2020, DTE identified a need to further support the low-income community in Detroit and across Michigan and increased the budget, savings and participation goals for the EEA program. It provided income-qualified customers with appliances such as high efficiency furnaces, water heaters, and services like home weatherization updates at no cost to the customer. This program is delivered through more than 40 community action, non-profit and government agencies. The Michigan Public Service Commission approved DTE to spend 1% of the overall Energy Waste Reduction budget to address health and safety issues that typically prevented customer participation in the EEA Program. This initiative reduced the number of uncompleted projects due to mold, asbestos, pest control, roof repair and other determents. DTE is partnering with the Detroit Community Health Corps to assist customers who were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with products and services through the EEA program. The company is also working with the City of Detroit, Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, University of Michigan, and other community organizations on a pilot to provide greater wrap-around services to Detroit residents in need. DTE has also worked with the United Community Housing Coalition (UCHC) to help keep 550 Detroiters from falling into home tax foreclosure. Another significant component to the program is DTE’s LED light bulb distribution program. In 2020 alone, DTE distributed more than 350,000 LED light bulbs to patrons of food banks and local community events. “We feel fortunate to be able to offer these income-qualified programs to DTE customers who are most in need,” continued Boladian. “DTE is proud to serve our community with meaningful economic relief when the need for assistance is greater than ever.” To learn more about DTE’s income-qualified programs, visit dteenergy.com/eeassistance.

Within the past year, the Foundation has awarded more than $2 million to address food insecurity. “At the DTE Energy Foundation, we know creating a healthier, more vital Michigan begins with creating stable households in which basic needs are met,” said Lynette Dowler, president, DTE Foundation. “That’s why we’ve provided over three million meals through our COVID-19 pandemic relief efforts since March 2020, and we continue to partner with relief agencies to put nutritious food on tables across our state.” According to Feeding America West Michigan, Mobile Food Pantry attendance increased by 64% in 2020. The DTE Foundation’s support empowers nonprofits to meet the rise in demand; pantries have also used the funding to amplify their efforts and serve people in need. “Food insecurity is in every neighborhood and at every school. Hunger doesn’t have a zip code. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the biggest areas of growth in need has been Macomb County,” said Gerry Brisson, president and CEO of Gleaners. “The DTE Foundation’s support for four School Food Mobile pantries in Macomb County is helping us stabilize families in high-need areas during the most tumultuous time in their lives. We’re inspired by the outpouring of support for children and families as Gleaners works every day to expand and adapt our services to meet increased need.” The following are examples of how grant recipients – and communities – have benefitted from the DTE Foundation’s $100,000 commitment: Feeding America West Michigan - $25,000 grant Broadened the food bank’s ability to provide Mobile Pantries in counties where food insecurity is high but financial support is low. The grant will fund 20 Mobile Pantries that will serve over 140,000 meals’ worth of food to an estimated 3,400 families across five counties. Fishes & Loaves – $25,000 grant Extended food pantry hours and supplies. Now open on Saturdays, the organization serves an additional 1,000 households per month. The DTE Foundation’s support also enabled the organization to create contactless drop off options for those who cannot leave their homes. Gleaners - $55,000 grant Helped support four critical School Food Mobile distributions in Macomb, sustaining nutritious food access to households in one of the hardest-hit counties in southeast Michigan. The program partners with local school districts to provide families in need with fresh produce, milk, and shelf stable groceries, including protein and whole grains.

The electric utility earnings amounted to $102 million, down 20.3%.For 2021, the company reaffirmed its outlook and expects adjusted EPS to come in at a range of $6.88 to $7.26, versus the consensus of $7.16. (See DTE stock analysis on TipRanks)DTE CFO David Ruud said, “We are well positioned for another solid year in 2021 as we continue to invest in reliability and infrastructure improvements for our customers.”DTE Energy also announced the progress on the spin-off of its non-utility natural gas pipeline, storage, and gathering business into a new and independent publicly-traded company. The company has initiated the Form 10 registration process with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The planned move will enhance focus on key customers and is likely to provide faster growth, the company said. The spin-off, which was announced in Oct. 2020, is expected to be completed by mid-year 2021. The transaction awaits the board of directors’ final approval and other regulatory approvals.On Jan. 21, Evercore ISI analyst Durgesh Chopra upgraded the stock’s rating to Buy from Hold and increased the price target to $134 (11.5% upside potential) from $121, as “the firm shook up its Energy sector ratings with a cautious view on the group in the near-term and a preference for value over quality.”The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating.
