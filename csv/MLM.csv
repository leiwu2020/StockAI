Shares of the leading supplier of heavy building materials, including aggregates, cement, ready-mixed concrete, and asphalt, gained 2.1% to close at $342.23 on June 21. 



MLM plans to use the proceeds from the 2031 and 2051 Notes, along with available cash, to finance the previously announced acquisition of the Lehigh West Region Business. Further, proceeds from the 2023 Notes will be utilized for general corporate purposes, including funding acquisitions and reducing debt. (See MLM stock chart on TipRanks)



The offering comprises 2023 Senior Notes worth $700 million with an interest rate of 0.650%, issued at 99.988% of par value. It also includes two offerings worth $900 million each: one Senior Notes due 2031, with a rate of 2.4% issued at 99.937% of par value, and another Senior Notes due 2051 at a rate of 3.2% issued at 99.197% of par value. 



Interest for all the notes will be payable semi-annually, in January and July, starting on January 15, 2022, until their respective maturities. Subject to closing conditions, MLM expects the notes offering to close on July 2.



J.P. Morgan analyst Adrian Huerta recently increased the price target on MLM from $335 to $385 (12.5% potential upside) and reiterated a Hold rating.



Huerta forecast that the new infrastructure bill will bring an incremental 15-20% upside. However, the upside could be halved if there are higher implied corporate taxes.   



Overall, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 2 Buys and 4 Holds. The average Martin Marietta Materials analyst price target of $398.60 implies 16.5% upside potential from current levels. Shares of MLM have jumped 63.2% over the past year.

Once the takeover closes, it should expand Martin Marietta product offerings across the U.S. (See Martin Marietta stock analysis on TipRanks) “With this acquisition, our Company will be well-positioned to capitalize on long-term demand drivers from increased state infrastructure investment in California and Arizona as well as continued private-sector growth across these regions. We are confident in our ability to quickly realize the benefits of this transaction following the same proven approach we took with our acquisitions of TXI and Bluegrass,” said CEO Ward Nye. Raymond James analyst Joshua Wilson has reiterated a Hold rating on the stock, following a first-quarter earnings report that topped expectations. “Martin beat both our model and consensus 1Q21 expectations almost entirely on stronger than expected aggregates segment margins, the sustainability of which we believe will be the focus of the conference call. Martin reiterated its annual guidance (i.e., implied EBITDA for the remainder of the year missed views on an organic basis),” wrote Mr. Wilson in a research note to investors. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 2 Buy and 3 Hold ratings. The average analyst price target of $402 implies 9.70% upside potential to current levels. MLM scores 8 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, suggesting it is likely to outperform the overall market.

See Appendix to this earnings release for a reconciliation to net earnings attributable to Martin Marietta. Ward Nye, Chairman and CEO of Martin Marietta, stated, “Following record performance in 2020, our Company is off to a strong start to what we expect to be another outstanding year for Martin Marietta. For the first three months of 2021, we delivered solid operational and financial performance, establishing first-quarter records for revenues, profits and safety. These results are a testament to our differentiated business model and dedication to our proven Strategic Operating Analysis and Review (SOAR) plan. “The Company expanded consolidated gross margin 290 basis points to 17.8 percent on 2.5-percent top-line improvement and generated record Adjusted EBITDA of $204 million, primarily driven by pricing gains achieved by our upstream aggregates and cement businesses and disciplined cost management across the enterprise. Importantly, the Building Materials business benefitted from widespread strengthening in product demand, notwithstanding the disruptions from February’s unprecedented winter ice storm in Texas, our largest revenue-generating state. Looking ahead, we remain confident that long-term secular demand trends and the rapidly recovering U.S. economy will drive aggregates-intensive construction growth in our key geographies. “We are equally excited to announce the strategic, value-enhancing acquisition of Tiller Corporation. Tiller is the leading aggregates and FOB hot mix asphalt supplier in the Minneapolis/St. Paul region, notably enhancing Martin Marietta’s high-margin, upstream materials business in one of the largest and fastest growing midwestern metropolitan areas. We expect this SOAR-aligned acquisition to be immediately accretive to earnings and cash flow, and contribute $170 million of product revenues and $60 million of Adjusted EBITDA for the remaining eight months of 2021.” Mr. Nye concluded, “Our record-setting first-quarter results underpin our confidence in Martin Marietta’s ability to continue delivering sustainable growth and superior shareholder value creation in 2021 and beyond. The Company’s unrivaled growth opportunities and steadfast commitment to disciplined pricing and operational excellence, combined with emerging demand tailwinds that are expected to support construction activity over the long term, firmly and uniquely position Martin Marietta to SOAR to a Sustainable Future.” First-Quarter Operating and Financial Results (All comparisons are versus the prior-year first quarter unless noted otherwise) Building Materials Business The Building Materials business achieved record first-quarter revenues and gross profit. Products and services revenues of $856.6 million increased 3.1 percent and product gross profit of $148.3 million increased 25.1 percent. During the quarter, the Building Materials business experienced broad-based improvements in product demand, as evidenced by shipment levels on days not impacted by harsh winter weather. Aggregates, cement and ready mixed concrete operations in Texas experienced temporary disruptions from February’s historic winter storm and subfreezing temperatures. Additionally, the aggregates and downstream operations in Colorado, the Company’s second largest revenue-generating state, faced a difficult comparison versus first-quarter 2020, which benefitted from unseasonably favorable weather conditions. Aggregates As anticipated in the Company’s previously-announced guidance, first-quarter aggregates shipments declined 3.0 percent. Pricing increased 3.4 percent, or 2.5 percent on a mix-adjusted basis. By segment: East Group shipments increased 0.2 percent, reflecting strong residential and nonresidential construction activity in the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida and Maryland, which more than offset the Midwest’s later start to the construction season, as compared with the prior year, as well as reduced wind energy construction activity. Pricing increased 3.9 percent, with improvements in both the East and Central divisions. West Group shipments decreased 7.7 percent, despite robust underlying demand, due to unfavorable winter weather conditions in both Texas and Colorado and reduced energy-sector demand. Geographic mix limited pricing growth to 1.9 percent. First-quarter aggregates gross profit per ton shipped improved 34.4 percent and product gross margin expanded 490 basis points to 21.3 percent, driven by pricing gains and lower overall costs for contract services and internal freight. Cement Cement shipments increased 0.3 percent despite the historic winter storm that shut down the Company’s cement operations for eleven days in February. Notably, the Midlothian facility in North Texas experienced double-digit shipment growth for the quarter, demonstrating the robust demand in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex that more than offset weather-related impacts and reduced energy-sector activity in South and West Texas. Pricing improved 1.5 percent, as lower sales of higher-priced oil-well specialty cement products into West Texas disproportionately limited overall pricing growth. On a mix-adjusted basis, cement pricing increased 2.2 percent. Cement product gross margin declined 1,160 basis points to 14.0 percent, driven by storm-related incremental costs and inefficiencies as a result of the unplanned plant shutdowns. Downstream businesses Ready mixed concrete shipments increased 26.5 percent, led by double-digit growth in Texas resulting from large projects and incremental volume from operations acquired in August 2020. This growth more than offset weather-related shipment declines in Colorado. Pricing declined 2.0 percent, reflecting geographic mix from a lower percentage of higher-priced Colorado shipments. Product gross margin improved 520 basis points to 8.3 percent, driven primarily by higher shipments and improved delivery costs. A return to normal winter weather conditions in Colorado contributed to the 36.2 percent decrease in asphalt shipments. Asphalt pricing increased 7.9 percent. Magnesia Specialties Business Magnesia Specialties first-quarter product revenues increased 8.9 percent to $65.3 million, reflecting improved demand for chemicals and lime products. Higher revenues, combined with disciplined cost control, resulted in record first-quarter product gross profit of $28.4 million. Product gross margin of 43.5 percent matched the first-quarter record established in the prior-year quarter. Consolidated For comparative purposes, total cost of revenues for first-quarter 2020 included $2.0 million of expense for the implementation of a new paid time off policy for employees. Additionally, first-quarter 2020 other nonoperating expenses, net, included $5.6 million to finance third-party railroad maintenance in exchange for a federal income tax benefit of $6.9 million. Cash Generation, Capital Allocation and Liquidity Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $191.9 million compared with $106.7 million for the prior-year period. Cash paid for property, plant and equipment additions for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $110.3 million. For the full-year, capital expenditures are expected to range from $425 million to $475 million. Through dividend payments and share repurchases, the Company returned $36.1 million to shareholders in the first three months of 2021 and nearly $1.9 billion since announcing a 20 million share repurchase authorization in February 2015. The Company had $354.8 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on hand and nearly $1.1 billion of unused borrowing capacity on its existing credit facilities as of March 31, 2021. Full-Year Outlook Martin Marietta remains confident that favorable pricing dynamics will continue, supported by the Company’s locally-driven pricing strategy. Additionally, the Company anticipates single-family housing growth, expanded infrastructure investment and notable heavy industrial projects of scale will drive increased shipment levels. Martin Marietta expects these demand drivers, combined with the ancillary construction necessary for housing community buildouts and the potential for increased infrastructure investment from a comprehensive federal surface transportation package, to result in sustained, multi-year growth in product demand. The Company’s full-year 2021 guidance provided below is unchanged from the guidance provided in February 2021. This guidance excludes the expected contribution of the Tiller acquisition as well as any benefit from additional fiscal stimulus, relief funds beyond those already enacted or a potential successor federal surface transportation bill. The Company will revisit its 2021 guidance when it reports half-year results. 2021 GUIDANCE ($ in millions, except per ton) Low * High * Consolidated Products and services revenues 1 $4,510 $4,700 Gross profit $1,290 $1,380 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) $320 $330 Interest expense $110 $115 Estimated tax rate (excluding discrete events) 20% 22%Net earnings attributable to Martin Marietta $665 $750 Adjusted EBITDA 2 $1,350 $1,450 Capital expenditures $425 $475 Building Materials Business Aggregates Volume % growth 3 1.0% 4.0%Average selling price per ton (ASP) % growth 4 3.0% 5.0%Products and services revenues $2,900 $2,990 Gross profit $895 $945 Cement Products and services revenues $460 $500 Gross profit $175 $185 Ready Mixed Concrete and Asphalt and Paving Products and services revenues $1,240 $1,310 Gross profit $130 $150 Magnesia Specialties Business Products and services revenues $230 $240 Gross profit $90 $100 * Guidance range represents the low end and high end of the respective line items provided above.1 Consolidated products and services revenues exclude $320 million to $340 million related to estimated interproduct sales and exclude freight revenues.2 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Mix-adjusted ASP is calculated by comparing current-period shipments to like-for-like shipments in the comparable prior period.

President Joseph Biden has recently released details of his “Build Back Better” plan, which includes around $2 trillion of infrastructure spending stateside. Therefore, today’s article introduces seven infrastructure stocks excited for the $2 trillion Biden plan. Many analysts concur that a great deal of infrastructure across the nation has been in need of revitalization. Thus, the proposed projects will be welcome by many communities and citizens. Meanwhile, economists highlight the importance of infrastructure investment in driving economic growth, especially following the uncertainty created by the pandemic. According to recent research by Jeffrey M. Stupak of the Congressional Research Service (CRS), “Over the past several decades, government investment in infrastructure as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) has declined. Annual infrastructure investment by federal, state, and local governments peaked in the late 1930s, at about 4.2% of GDP, and since has fallen to about 1.6% of GDP in 2016.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips With the infrastructure plan proposed by the new administration, an investment of about $2 trillion across the nation is expected. As a result, there could be massive upside potential not only for traditional infrastructure stocks but also for some high growth stocks. As our economy opens up, many companies will benefit from low interest rates and the massive government stimulus. However, we should remind InvestorPlace.com readers that they are mostly cyclical stocks, ebbing with the news regarding the economy. Therefore, their share prices can also be volatile at times. 7 Great Stocks to Buy Under $10 With that information, here are seven infrastructure stocks that are well-positioned to benefit from the upcoming investments in infrastructure projects: Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) Columbus McKinnon (NASDAQ:CMCO) Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (BATS:PAVE) Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) Nucor (NYSE:NUE) SPDR S&P Kensho Intelligent Structures ETF (NYSEARCA:SIMS) Infrastructure Stocks: Caterpillar (CAT) Source: Shutterstock 52-week range: $100.22-$237.78Year-to-date (YTD) price change: Up about 25%Dividend yield: 1.8% Our first stock is a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The Deerfield, Illinois based Caterpillar is one of the largest manufacturers of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives. At the end of January, Caterpillar announced its 2020 full year and Q4 financials. The company reports revenue in four segments: construction industries, resource industries, energy & transportation, and Caterpillar Financial Services. Over 40% of revenues come from North America. Put another way, it has a large global footprint, too. Total sales were $11.2 billion, implying a 15% decline year-over-year (YoY). Net earnings were down by 29% YoY and stood at $780 million. EPS was $1.42, compared with $1.97 profit per share in Q4 2019. The company ended the year with a $9.4 billion cash figure. CEO Jim Umpleby cited “We do expect 2021 to be a better year than 2020 for us. We expect higher sales, but just given the uncertainty around the pandemic, the rollout of the vaccine, the resulting impact on the global economy, although we expect it to be a better year, it’s difficult for us to quantify how much better it will be just based on the pandemic.” CAT stock’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios are 29.5 and 3.07, respectively. Given the upcoming earnings season, there could be short-term profit-taking in the shares. A potential decline toward the $215 level would improve the margin of safety in the shares of this iconic company. On a final note, the company is a dividend aristocrat with almost three decades of dividend increases. Columbus McKinnon (CMCO) Source: Gorodenkoff via Shutterstock 52-week range: $21.52-$57.06YTD price change: Up about 38%Dividend yield: 0.46% Our next company is the Getzville, New York based material handling specialist Columbus McKinnon. It designs motion control products and technologies that move, lift, position and secure materials. The group’s products include hoists, actuators, rigging tools, light rail work stations and digital power and motion control systems. They are used in many industries, including construction and infrastructure, mining, oil, energy, aerospace, transportation, automotive, heavy equipment manufacturing and entertainment. In late January, CMCO announced financial results for its fiscal year 2021 third quarter, which ended Dec. 31, 2020. Revenue was down by 16.5% YoY to $166.5 million mainly due to the pandemic’s adverse impact on volumes. The company generates 53% of its sales from the U.S. Net income also slid from $15.3 million in Q3 2020 to $6.6 million in Q3 2021. Hence, diluted EPS fell from 63 cents to 27 cents. Free cash flow recorded was $22 million at the end of the period. CEO David Wilson commented, “We delivered solid results in adverse conditions with revenue exceeding our expectations. We are optimistic that growth will accelerate in fiscal 2022 as demand improves and channel partners replenish inventories. Given current macroeconomic forecasts, we expect to return to more normalized revenue levels by this time next year.” The company expects Q4 2021 sales to be within $175-$180 million range. 7 Big Names That Could Be the Next Tesla CMCO stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratio of the stock stands at 24.04 and 1.92. Moving items around plants, construction sites, or factories might not sound like a growth area. However, Columbus McKinnon is likely to benefit from increased infrastructure spending. The shares would offer better value around $50. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) Source: 360b / Shutterstock.com 52-week range: $7.30-$39.10YTD % change: Up about 29%Dividend yield: 0.87% Phoenix, Arizona-based miner Freeport-McMoRan is the largest copper producer in the world. Since copper is an important commodity in building and construction work, the company has been in the limelight in recent weeks. Meanwhile, the price of copper has also been on the rise, providing tailwinds for FCX share price. In March 2020, the price of copper was about $2 per pound. Now it is about $4 per pound. Part of the increase in the commodity price is due to copper’s role in green energy as electric vehicles (EVs) use copper, too. It is also used in solar and wind technologies. The company operates through geographical assets with reserves of copper, gold and molybdenum. The segments include refined copper products, copper in concentrate, gold, molybdenum, oil and other. Freeport-McMoRan reported fourth quarter and 2020 full year results in late January. Consolidated sales totaled $4.5 billion in the fourth quarter, compared to $3.91 billion in the prior year period. Adjusted net income totaled $566 million, or 39 cents per share. As of Dec. 31, 2020, it had $3.66 billion in cash and equivalents in hand. CEO Richard C. Adkerson said, “We are enthusiastic about the future prospects for our business based on the positive outlook for the markets we serve, our long-lived and high-quality copper assets, our seasoned and highly motivated global organization and the critical role of copper to the technologies necessary to deliver clean energy and support the global transition to a low-carbon economy.” FCX stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios are 15.11 and 3.54, respectively. A decline toward $33 would offer a better entry point into the shares of the mining group. 2020 has been a fantastic year for most commodities. Analysts concur that the industry outlook for copper is positive, potentially providing tailwinds for increased cash flow for the company. Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) Source: Shutterstock 52-Week Range: $11.99-$25.88YTD change: About 21%Dividend Yield: 0.4%Expense Ratio: 0.47% per year Our next discussion centers around a thematic exchange-traded fund (ETF) Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development. The fund invests in firms that could benefit from a potential increase in infrastructure activity stateside. Such businesses could produce of raw materials or manufacture or lease heavy equipment. They might also come from engineering, and construction segments. PAVE, which has 101 holdings, tracks the Index U.S. Infrastructure Development Index. The ETF started trading in 2017 and net assets under management total $2.62 billion. Approximately 30% of the holdings are in the top ten stocks.

In terms of sectors, industrials, materials and information technology (IT) make up 64.4%, 22.5% and 5.2% of its holdings, respectively. 7 Monthly Dividend Stocks That Pay the Bills Over the past 12 months, PAVE has returned close to 92%. There could be some profit-taking in the coming weeks as many of the names in the fund report earnings. Interested investors could consider a decline toward the $23 level as a potential entry point. Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) Source: Shutterstock 52-week range: $151.94-$353.56YTD % change: Up about 22%Dividend yield: 0.67% Raleigh, North Carolina-based Martin Marietta Materials supplies aggregates products (such as crushed stone, sand, and gravel) used in construction as well as in in agricultural, utility and environmental applications. The company operates under three segments: Aggregates Business, Cement Business and Magnesia Specialties Business. In 2020, Martin Marietta sold 187 million tons of aggregates. The group reported fourth-quarter and 2020 full-year results in mid-February. Net sales were $1.18 billion, a small increase from $1.10 billion from Q4 2019.

Martin Marietta had $304.4 million of cash and equivalents on hand as of Dec. 31, 2020. CEO Ward Nye, stated, “Our resilient business model and team’s commitment to Martin Marietta’s vision and strategic priorities enabled us to achieve record fourth-quarter results and deliver record full-year profitability and the best safety performance in our Company’s history. Notably, 2020 marked our ninth consecutive year of growth for products and services revenues, gross profit, Adjusted EBITDA and earnings-per-diluted-share.” Over the past year, MLM shares have returned 76%. Like most companies in the sector, Martin Marietta benefitted from investor belief that the recovery would be faster than initially expected. Forward P/E and P/S ratios are 30.49 and 4.51, respectively. Those investors who believe the construction-led upcycle will benefit the company could consider investing around $330. Nucor (NUE) Source: Shutterstock 52-week range: $34.72-$82.76YTD price change: Up about 50%Dividend yield: 2.04% Charlotte, North Carolina based Nucor is one of the largest steelmakers stateside. The company is involved in every phase of steelmaking, from collecting and processing scrap to manufacturing value-added fabricated steel products. As a result of the proposed U.S. spending, the company has been in the limelight. Nucor announced Q4 2020 figures at the end of January. The top line rose by 2.5% YoY to $5.26 billion. Diluted EPS jumped from 35 cents levels in Q4 2019 to $1.30 in Q4 2020. Cash and equivalents were $2.64 million. CEO Leon Topalian said, “Looking ahead, we are confident that Nucor is poised for continued growth, and we anticipate earnings in the first quarter of 2021 to significantly increase from the fourth quarter of 2020.” According to company guidance, which was updated on March 16th, Nucor expects to announce record breaking quarterly earnings in Q1 2021, as diluted EPS is anticipated to be in the range of $3.00-$3.10. 7 Micro-Cap Stocks to Buy That Are Shining Right Now NUE stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios are 8.32 and 1.2, respectively. Interested investors who believe steel sales will increase could regard any decline in the shares as a good opportunity to invest for the long-term. SPDR S&P Kensho Intelligent Structures ETF (SIMS) Source: Shutterstock 52-Week Range: $23.85-$47.29Dividend Yield: 0.55%YTD Price Change: Up about 10%Expense Ratio: 0.45% per year President Biden is adamant that his administration will increasingly push for sustainable infrastructure.
