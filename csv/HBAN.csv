(HBNC) revealed that its subsidiary Horizon Bank has inked a deal to acquire 14 TCF National Bank branches which are being divested by TCF Financial Corp. (TCF) as part of the ongoing merger with Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (HBAN). Shares of Horizon Bancorp declined 4.2% on Tuesday.



The branches are located in 11 Michigan counties and come with approximately $976 million in deposits and $278 million in associated loans. (See Horizon Bancorp stock analysis on TipRanks)



Horizon expects the deal to be accretive to 2022 EPS by more than 17% excluding expenses.  The internal rate of return (IRR) is forecast to be 21%. The deal is expected to dilute the tangible book value (TBV) by 5% with TBV earnback of two years.



Through this acquisition, Horizon estimates that 50,000 retail and small customer accounts will get added along with the complete workforce of the acquired branches. At present, Horizon Bank has 74 branches including 15 in Michigan.



Per the terms of the deal, Horizon Bank will pay $17.1 million for the acquired deposits. This reflects a 1.75% premium to the $976 million in deposits as of March 31, 2021.  The company will finance the deal from excess capital and available cash.



Notably, the deposits have an average relationship life of over 10 years. Furthermore, the 0.08% average cost of acquired deposits will further bring down Horizon’s total deposit cost, which averaged 0.21% in the first quarter of 2021.



Horizon Bank will also take up residential mortgages, consumer, and small business loans at the branches at a 3.50% discount to cover any credit risk exposure. Loans outstanding were $278 million as of March 31, 2021.



The acquisition is expected to close by the third quarter of 2021 and is subject to certain regulatory approvals.



The Huntington-TCF Financial merger has received all necessary approvals and the deal is expected to close on June 9.



HBNC’s CEO Craig M. Dwight commented, “We are excited to welcome Horizon Bank’s newest employees and customers and introduce them to our record of exceptional service to consumers, small businesses, non-profits and municipalities across Michigan and Indiana….This financially and strategically attractive transaction is a logical extension of our efficient retail franchise, which is designed to further enhance our low-cost core deposit and funding capability to support loan growth in a recovering economy.”



On May 19, Raymond James analyst David Long reiterated a Buy rating and price target of $21 (19% upside potential) on the stock.



Long commented, “With an abundance of excess liquidity and robust capital levels, it is clear that the team's first priority is to grow the franchise and is well positioned to do so. In the near-term, loan growth faces headwinds, but M&A activity remains a viable option, and we have identified several potential targets for Horizon.”



He further added, “We remain bullish on HBNC shares over the long-term as we believe the bank will continue to gain market share over its peers due to its attractive organic growth profile, supplemented with M&A.”



Overall, HBNC has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 2 unanimous Buys. The average analyst price target of $21 implies 19% upside potential from current levels.



TipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 100% Bullish on HBNC, compared to a sector average of 68%.

Analyst Ratings: What Are They? Analysts are specialists within banking and financial systems that typically report for specific stocks or within defined sectors. These people research company financial statements, sit in conference calls and meetings, and speak with relevant insiders to determine what are known as analyst ratings for stocks. Typically, analysts will rate each stock once a quarter. Analysts also give out recommendations like ""buy"", ""sell"", ""hold"", or similar verbage for each stock based on their overall evaluations of the corres ponding company. A ""buy"" indicates that an analyst is optimistic about a stock's short-term or mid-term growth, recommending traders to purchase the stock. Contrastingly, a ""sell"" means that an analyst believes the stock will trend downwards in that same time frame. A ""hold"" suggests that investors should not buy more of or sell any of the specified stock due to that analyst's prediction of stagnation. Some analysts publish their predictions for metrics such as growth estimates, earnings, and revenue to provide additional guidance with their ratings. When using analyst ratings, it is important to keep in mind that stock and sector analysts are also human and are only offering their opinions to investors.

The company’s 4Q revenues on an FTE (fully-taxable equivalent) basis also came in below analysts' expectations.Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) reported 4Q earnings of $0.27 per share, which declined 4% year-over-year and fell short of analysts’ estimates of $0.29 per share. Meanwhile, the company’s FTE revenues of $1.24 billion grew 7% year-over-year but missed the consensus estimates of $1.25 billion.The bank’s net interest margin declined to 2.94% in the fourth quarter from 3.12% in the year-ago quarter, while provision for credit losses increased to $103 million in 4Q from $79 million in the year-ago period. However, average loans and leases increased 8%, while average core deposits increased 16% at the end of the fourth quarter. (See HBAN stock analysis on TipRanks)Meanwhile, the company also announced a quarterly dividend of $0.15 a share, which will be paid on Apr. 1 to shareholders of record as of Mar. 18. The quarterly payouts translate into an annual dividend yield of about 4.3%.As for 2021, the company expects sales to grow in the range of approximately 1% to 3%. The company anticipates average loans and leases to increase in the range of about 2% to 4%, with approximately 5% to 7% growth expected for average total deposits on an annual basis.Following the results, Wedbush analyst Peter Winter maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $18 (30.1% upside potential) on the stock. Winter said, “HBAN delivered positive operating leverage (POL) for the 8th consecutive year in 2020, an enviable track record. Given the revenue momentum we assumed HBAN would deliver POL in 2021 (ex-TCF [TCF Financial Corporation] acquisition).” He added, “Despite the improvement in credit trends, HBAN plans to be more prudent with releasing reserves until they see more economic certainty, before it undertakes more aggressive reserve releases.”From the rest of the Street, the stock scores a cautiously optimistic outlook with the analyst consensus of a Moderate Buy based on 6 Buys and 6 Holds. The average analyst price target of $15.70 implies upside potential of about 13.4% to current levels.
