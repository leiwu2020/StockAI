The stock will then go ex-dividend 1 business day(s) before the record date. Essex Property Trust, which has a current dividend per share of $2.09, has an ex-dividend date scheduled for March 30, 2021. That equates to a dividend yield of 3.13% at current price levels. Understanding Ex-Dividend Dates' Ex-dividend dates signal when company shares cease to trade with their current dividend payouts. There is a small intermission period before companies announce new dividends. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Most ex-dividend dates operate on a quarterly basis. Essex Property Trust's Dividend Payouts And Yields Over the past year, Essex Property Trust has seen its dividend payouts and yields climb upward overall. Last year (March 30, 2020), the company's payout sat at $2.08, which has since increased by $0.01. Essex Property Trust's dividend yield last year was 2.55%, which has since grown by 0.58%. Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market.
