While there is starting to be some recovery in certain geographies, there continues to be a negative impact on our operations and financial results. First Quarter Results Reported net sales increased 10.2% from 2020 and 12.4% from 2019 to $4.0 billionOrganic net sales increased 1.8% from 2020 and 4.7% from 2019Reported operating income margin of 11.6%Adjusted operating income margin(1) contracted 50 bps to 23.5%Reported EPS decreased 39.2% to $0.79Adjusted EPS(1) increased 4.9% to $1.93 In addition to sales growth analysis versus 2020, we are including sales growth versus 2019 as 2019 provides a more normal baseline for comparison given the variability caused by the COVID-19 pandemic throughout 2020.

""We expect this momentum to continue and are encouraged by the Wright Medical integration, which is pacing ahead of our expectations."" Sales Analysis Compared to 2020 and 2019 Consolidated net sales of $4.0 billion increased 10.2% in the quarter and 8.0% in constant currency from 2020. Organic net sales increased 1.8% in the quarter including 2.7% from increased unit volume partially offset by 0.9% from lower prices. From 2019 consolidated net sales increased 12.4% in the quarter and 11.1% in constant currency. Organic net sales increased 4.7% in the quarter including 6.1% from increased unit volume partially offset by 1.4% from lower prices. Orthopaedics net sales of $1.5 billion increased 21.4% in the quarter and 18.7% in constant currency from 2020. Organic net sales increased 0.5% in the quarter including 2.6% from increased unit volume partially offset by 2.1% from lower prices. From 2019 Orthopaedics net sales increased 18.7% in the quarter and 17.2% in constant currency. Organic net sales decreased 0.7% in the quarter including 2.7% from increased unit volume offset by 3.4% from lower prices. MedSurg net sales of $1.6 billion remained flat in the quarter and decreased 1.6% in constant currency from 2020. Organic net sales decreased 1.6% in the quarter including 1.4% from decreased unit volume and 0.2% from lower prices. From 2019 MedSurg net sales increased 6.2% in the quarter and 5.3% in constant currency. Organic net sales increased 5.3% in the quarter from increased unit volume. Neurotechnology and Spine net sales of $0.8 billion increased 14.0% in the quarter and 11.3% in constant currency from 2020. Organic net sales increased 11.3% in the quarter including 11.9% from increased unit volume partially offset by 0.6% from lower prices. From 2019 Neurotechnology and Spine net sales increased 14.6% in the quarter and 12.8% in constant currency. Organic net sales increased 12.8% in the quarter including 13.4% from increased unit volume partially offset by 0.6% from lower prices. Earnings Analysis Compared to 2020 Reported net earnings of $302 million decreased 38.7% in the quarter. Reported net earnings per diluted share of $0.79 decreased 39.2% in the quarter. Reported gross profit margin and reported operating income margin were 63.5% and 11.6% in the quarter. Reported net earnings include certain items, such as charges for acquisition and integration-related activities, the amortization of purchased intangible assets, restructuring-related and other charges, costs to comply with certain medical device regulations, recall-related matters, regulatory and legal matters and tax matters. Excluding the aforementioned items, adjusted gross profit margin(1) was 65.4% in the quarter, and adjusted operating income margin(1) was 23.5% in the quarter, a decline of 50 basis points. Adjusted net earnings(1) of $737 million increased 5.4% in the quarter. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share(1) of $1.93 increased 4.9% in the quarter. 2021 Outlook We continue to monitor and evaluate the impact the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, on our operations and financial results. As we recover from the pandemic, we continue to expect 2021 organic net sales growth to be in the range of 8% to 10% from 2019, as this is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020, and now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share(2) to be in the range of $9.05 to $9.30, including the full year impact of the acquisition of Wright Medical. Consistent with the pricing environment experienced in both 2019 and 2020, we expect continued unfavorable price reductions of approximately 1% in 2021. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect EPS will be positively impacted by $0.05 to $0.10 for the full year. This guidance assumes an ongoing recovery in our key geographies leading to more normalized elective procedure levels during the second quarter of 2021. As previously announced, we will not be providing quarterly guidance. (1) A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures: gross profit margin, operating income and operating income margin, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, and other important information accompanies this press release. (2) We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of our expected net earnings per diluted share to expected adjusted net earnings per diluted share as we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable effort the impact and timing of restructuring-related and other charges, acquisition-related expenses and fair value adjustments to inventory and the outcome of certain regulatory, legal and tax matters. The financial impact of these items is uncertain and is dependent on various factors, including timing, and could be material to our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including: percentage sales growth; percentage sales growth in constant currency; percentage organic sales growth; adjusted gross profit; adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses; adjusted research, development and engineering expenses; adjusted operating income; adjusted other income (expense), net; adjusted effective income tax rate; adjusted net earnings; adjusted net earnings per diluted share (Diluted EPS); free cash flow; and free cash flow conversion. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures. To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rate. To measure percentage organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions, which affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions. To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. To measure free cash flow, we adjust cash provided by operating activities by the amount of purchases of property, plant and equipment and proceeds from long-lived asset disposals and remove the impact of certain legal settlements and recall payments. To measure free cash flow conversion we divide free cash flow by adjusted net earnings. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, research, development and engineering expenses, operating income, other income (expense), net, effective income tax rate, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures below, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of non-GAAP net earnings per diluted share are the same as those used in the calculation of reported net earnings per diluted share for the respective period.

According to the FDA, the plastic component may break as soon as three to four years after the device is inserted, leading to surgery to repair or replace the device. The agency noted that plastic component fractures in the device might be attributed to multiple issues, including the component’s thickness, the degradation of the material, surgical factors, and patient factors, such as younger patients with higher activity levels. The FDA believes the STAR Ankle remains appropriate for certain patient populations, such as older patients with lower activity levels. The STAR Ankle is indicated for use as an artificial joint and used to replace a painful arthritic ankle joint due to osteoarthritis, post-traumatic arthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis.

company,1608177230,Boston Scientific vs Stryker: Which Medical Device Stock is a More Compelling Play?,61773654,https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?2133574324,SYK,Nasdaq,"Favorable COVID-19 vaccine developments have revived the hopes of several companies that have seen demand for their products crushed by the unprecedented pandemic. That said, the recent spike in COVID-19 cases continue to spook makers of medical devices, which suffered due to cancellation or postponement of non-emergency or elective surgeries earlier this year. Following the easing of lockdown restrictions, several medical device makers reported a recovery in their sales.However, the growth trajectory now looks uncertain as COVID-19 continues to wreak havoc. Bearing in mind a challenging business landscape, we will use TipRanks' Stock Comparison tool to place Boston Scientific alongside Stryker Corporation to see which stock offers a more compelling investment opportunity.  Boston Scientific (BSX)First up is Boston Scientific, which manufactures a range of medical devices that help in the diagnosis and treatment of several medical conditions, including coronary artery diseases, structural heart conditions, neurological movement disorders and cardiac abnormalities.Boston Scientific shares have plunged 22.3% year-to-date and the reasons are not restricted to the impact of the pandemic on the company’s operations. What hurt investor sentiment was the negative news flow with regard to certain key growth areas. (See BSX stock analysis on TipRanks)Notably, Boston Scientific previously indicated that it expects its ACURATE neo2 TAVR (transcatheter aortic valve replacement) system to gain US FDA approval in 2021. However, the company now expects ACURATE neo2 TAVR to be approved in 2024, after the product failed to demonstrate non-inferiority when compared to Medtronic’s CoreValve Evolut TAVR valves in the Scope II Trial.If this wasn't enough, the company announced last month a voluntary recall of all unused inventory of the LOTUS Edge aortic valve systems due to complexities associated with the product delivery system. Boston Scientific revealed that it has decided to discontinue the Lotus TAVR platform following years of struggle. The Lotus TAVR valve was earlier considered a key growth driver, but it failed to deliver the desired growth and also faced manufacturing challenges.Despite these setbacks, Boston Scientific scores the Street’s Strong Buy analyst consensus based on 13 Buys and 1 Hold. The average price target stands at $43.07, suggesting an upside potential of 22.6% over the coming year.Earlier this month, Guggenheim analyst Christopher Pasquale reiterated a Buy rating on Boston Scientific but lowered the price target to $43 from $44 after the company announced that it was divesting its BTG specialty pharma business for $800 million. Pasquale noted that the specialty pharma business was a poor fit with the rest of the company’s portfolio and the divestment removes a “potential 2021 overhang.”The analyst believes that the stock is a prime turnaround candidate heading into 2021, and is one of the more attractive longer-term growth stories. He predicts organic revenue and adjusted EPS growth of 7.5% and 14-15%, respectively, in 2022-2023, which is higher than his large-cap average estimates of 5% and 10%. “And importantly, this strong growth trajectory isn’t reliant on any one product or end market,” highlighted Pasquale.“While Boston’s entry and now temporary exit from the U.S. TAVR market rightly garners significant attention from investors, the company has a diverse pipeline of growth drivers across each of its business segments. Boston has also supplemented its internal product development with an aggressive M&A strategy, adding a number of compelling new opportunities to its portfolio over the past few years that we believe will become increasingly important to the company’s growth story in 2021 and beyond,” the analyst concluded.Stryker Corporation (SYK)Stryker, one of the leading medical device companies, offers its products and services in areas like orthopaedics, medical and surgical as well as neurotechnology and spine. The company has shown more resilience to the pandemic than many of its peers. It bounced back with revenue growth of 4.2% in 3Q after facing significant pandemic-led disruptions in the previous quarter.Last month, Stryker completed the $4.7 billion acquisition of Wright Medical after selling certain assets to win the Federal Trade Commission’s approval. The company believes that Wright Medical will add a highly complementary product portfolio to its trauma and extremities business and enhance its presence in the fastest-growing segments in orthopaedics.In reaction to the completion of the acquisition, Needham analyst Michael Matson reiterated a Hold rating, noting that Wright Medical will strengthen Stryker's extremities business and is largely complementary, particularly in shoulders where the company’s market share is very low. While Stryker had to divest some of its total ankle products to win the regulator’s blessings, Matson believes that Wright’s market-leading total ankle portfolio puts the company in a stronger competitive position.However, the 5-star analyst sees integration risks and potential for revenue dis-synergies given the “substantial product and sales force overlap” between the two companies, especially in the lower extremities category. (See SYK stock analysis on TipRanks)Overall, Matson feels that Stryker can return to above-average top line growth relative to its large-cap peers once the pandemic abates. However, he is concerned about the company's 25% capital equipment exposure given the category’s slower recovery than elective procedures, integration challenges associated with the Wright acquisition and growing rivalry in the robotics space from Zimmer Biomet and potentially Johnson & Johnson.Right now, the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on Stryker, with a Moderate Buy analyst consensus based on 10 Buys, 4 Holds and 1 Sell. Given the 12% year-to-date rise in shares, the average price target of $240.92 indicates a modest upside potential of 2.5% from current levels.ConclusionStryker recently announced a 9.6% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.63, payable in January 2021. Stryker’s dividend yield stands at 1.1%. In comparison, Boston Scientific currently does not pay any dividends. That said, Boston Scientific appears to be a better pick than Stryker, backed by the Street’s Strong Buy consensus rating (which is based on the company’s diversified product portfolio and attractive pipeline), greater upside potential in the stock and lower valuation.   To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.
