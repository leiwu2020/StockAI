These investments, and the partnerships formed around them, are critical to the commercialization of the technology and to help Eavor scale its already extensive project pipeline. Eavor’s technology, known as Eavor-Loop™, uses the natural heat of the earth like a giant rechargeable battery. Fluids are heated by the earth and circulated in a closed network of underground wellbores, unlocking a reliable and consistent energy source. Eavor’s technology differs from other forms of geothermal in that it is a scalable “go anywhere” solution, harvesting geothermal heat to generate dispatchable power with zero emissions. In addition to Eavor-Loop’s™ environmental benefits, the consistency of its heat harvesting gives it the potential to directly replace the traditional forms of baseload power such as coal and nuclear. The dispatchable nature of its design also makes Eavor-Loop™ a form of energy storage and thus singularly complementary to intermittent power sources like wind and solar. The investments will also bolster Eavor’s on-going research and development efforts to drive the cost of Eavor-Loop’s™ clean dispatchable power to a price point that is competitive in all markets. Felipe Arbelaez, bp’s svp zero carbon energy, said: “We see Eavor’s potential to be complementary to our growing wind and solar portfolios. Our expertise and experience also makes bp well equipped to support Eavor’s growth. Technology such as Eavor’s has the potential to deliver geothermal power and heat and help unlock a low carbon future.” John Redfern, President & CEO, Eavor Technologies Inc., added: “I am delighted that with the funding closed in this round we can look forward to bringing down the cost of clean, dispatchable power to a universally competitive level – an important milestone for renewable energy. The involvement of companies such as bp and Chevron represents a fantastic endorsement of our technology, the progress we have made to date and the promise for its global scalability.” Contact:Eavor Technologies Inc. John Redfern, President and CEO, Director 650-269-2501 john.redfern@eavor.comwww.eavor.com About Eavor:Eavor (pronounced “Ever”) is a technology-based Energy company led by a team dedicated to creating a clean, reliable and affordable energy future on a global scale. Eavor’s solution (Eavor-Loop™) represents the world’s first truly scalable form of clean dispatchable power. Eavor achieves this by mitigating or eliminating many of the issues that have traditionally hindered geothermal energy. Eavor instead circulates a benign working fluid which is completely isolated from the environment in a closed-loop, through a massive subsurface radiator. This “radiator” simply collects heat from the natural geothermal gradient of the Earth via conduction, at geologically common and drilling accessible rock temperatures.

Eversource Energy also posted a total of $2.34 billion in sales, a 20.02% increase since Q2. Eversource Energy earned $433.65 million, and sales totaled $1.95 billion in Q2.Why ROCE Is Significant Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q3, Eversource Energy posted an ROCE of 0.04%.Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.Return on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders.For Eversource Energy, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q3 Earnings Insight Eversource Energy reported Q3 earnings per share at $1.02/share, which came in-line with analyst predictions of $1.02/share.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * ROCE Insights For Tesla  * Looking Into Ralph Lauren's Return On Capital Employed(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.
