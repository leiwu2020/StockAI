(AAL) soared 3% to close at $20.62 on July 14, following the news that the company is lifting its Q2 guidance ahead of its earnings. AAL also stated that it is expecting to report its first positive quarter post-pandemic.



AAL credited factors such as continued momentum in travel demand and forward bookings for its positive outlook. American flew 44 million passengers during the quarter, up 83% from the first quarter and more than five times that of the year-ago period.  (See American Airlines stock charts on TipRanks)



The sector was one of the worst-hit when nationwide borders and global travel came to a standstill owing to the pandemic. However, the sector is recovering steadily with the strong vaccine rollout and easing of travel restrictions.



In Q2, the company expects to report revenue of $7.475 billion, and earnings (excluding net special items) are expected to be in the range of $(1.67) to $(1.76) per share. The Streets’ estimates for revenue and earnings are pegged at $7.14 billion and $(2.41) per share.



Additionally, the company forecast an average daily cash build of $1 million, showing a significant improvement over an average daily cash burn of $27 million reported in the first quarter. The company also expects to report approximately $21.3 billion in total available liquidity at quarter-end. 



The company’s CEO Doug Parker said, “Our revenue and expense performance in the quarter came in better than expectations, and this was achieved while bringing the operation back up to full capacity and safely transporting a record number of travelers.” 



On July 13, Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu maintained a Hold rating on the stock and assigned a price target of $24, implying 16.4% upside potential to current levels.



Kahyaoglu said, “Our Hold rating balances our belief that AAL may be the best positioned of the network carriers with the youngest fleet and a strong competitive positioning through its network, with the restrictive nature of AAL's leverage keeping us on the side-line.”



The stock has an overall Hold consensus rating based on 2 Buys, 4 Holds, and 4 Sells. The average American Airlines price target of $20.83 implies 1% upside potential to current levels. Shares have gained 53.4% over the past year.



According to TipRanks’ Smart Score system, American Airlines gets a 5 out of 10, which indicates that the stock is likely to perform in line with market averages.

(AAL) is no exception, seeing its share price hit a year-long high on June 2, and from there pulling back about 22%. (See American Airlines stock charts on TipRanks)  



Expressing her hypothesis on the company is Savanthi Syth of Raymond James Financial. Syth was not won over by the high demand for flights or the revenues brought in. Instead, she explained that the challenges facing the company and industry in general were too strong for any new attractive entry point. Syth rated the stock a Hold, and did not assign a price target. 



The four-star analyst wrote that reasons for the slump in share price include investor rotation out of the sector, consumer fears over the contagious Delta-variant of COVID-19, and rising gas costs for airlines. However, the latter is already baked into her forecasts for the airline industry, and as such is a non-issue in her evaluations.  



Easing CDC guidelines on leisure travel are expected to aide the airline with its domestic business, although those benefits might be canceled out by the slowdown in international travel. Nevertheless, Syth noted, American Airlines traditionally has “lower exposure to the long-haul international segment,” than its ilk. Furthermore, she does not expect countries that have vaccinated over 50% of their eligible populations to rollback reopening their economies.  



Even after the CARES act helpfully injected capital into the airline, AAL still finds itself in a short-staffed position and unable to operate about 1% of its July flights. It recently announced the temporary cancellation of these flights, but Syth expects the company to be back on its feet by the fall season.  



Syth defended her rating on the stock, stating that AAL’s “balance sheet remains the worst amongst U.S. airlines on an adjusted net debt to total capitalization basis.” The company does not have nearly the thirst for capital that United Airlines (UAL) has after its aircraft purchases, but will have pressure to deleverage its balance sheet soon after Delta Air Lines (DAL) deleverages its own.  



On TipRanks, AAL has an analyst rating consensus of Moderate Sell, based on 2 Buy, 2 Hold, and 5 Sell ratings. The average American Airlines price target is $21.44, suggesting a potential 12-month upside of 1.47% as of early Wednesday intra-day trading.
