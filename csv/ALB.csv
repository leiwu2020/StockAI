Thirteen years after the Tesla Roadster made its debut, a first generation of EVs is nearing retirement, making more battery packs available. Once that happens, recycling is going to “take off,” said Christopher Perrella of Bloomberg Intelligence.“It is very early stages, it’s something we’re investing in now,” Eric Norris, Albemarle’s head of lithium, said in an interview. “It’s a pretty comprehensive effort and a critical one for our growth going forward. We view this as a future resource that we would like to play prominently in.”The recycling initiative is already underway at the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company, with a joint development agreement in place with a customer and the company looking at making investments with original equipment manufacturers, Norris said. Albermarle will help OEMs recycle from end-of-life batteries using its proprietary technology, he said.The commercial activity will be in the second half of the decade, when regulatory mandates stipulate those batteries have to be recycled, Norris said.BloombergNEF estimates 62,000 metric tons of used EV and stationary storage packs reached their end of life in 2020. This will grow to more than 4 million tons by 2035, according to BNEF.In 2030, the world’s drivers and fleets are expected to buy almost 26 million electric vehicles a year, and junkyards will take in almost 1.7 million metric tons in scrapped batteries, BNEF said. Cumulative passenger, e-bus and commercial EV sales totaled 7.7 million at the end of 2019, according to the analysts.Albemarle’s push may also help burnish its environmental credentials.Recycling is viewed by environmental groups as one important way to reduce new mining projects. In the future, end-of-life EV lithium-ion batteries will be the major source for secondary metals for cobalt, lithium and nickel, according to an April report commissioned by Earthworks and published by the Institute for Sustainable Futures, University of Technology Sydney.Recycling is part of the sustainable aspect of electric vehicles, Kent Masters, Albemarle’s chief executive officer, said in the interview. At the end of life of EV batteries, “we have the skill set to help recycle that and to close the loop around EVs and lithium-ion batteries,” he said.The recycle processing will be done on a local basis in Europe and North America, according to Masters.Canadian battery-recycling startup Li-Cycle Corp. said on Tuesday that it was awarded a multi-year contract with Ultium Cells LLC, a joint venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution, to recycle critical materials from scrap and manufacturing excess generated by battery cell manufacturing.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4e53befd0504f52cb550498dce785d64782fff6cada2e702d997b940ea8fe52e

The company projects net sales of between $870 million and $880 million in 4Q compared to analysts’ estimates of of $836 million. Adjusted EPS was guided at between $1.11 and $1.19 versus the Street consensus of $1.07.“We expect our Lithium business to experience lower pricing, offset by higher volumes. Higher Lithium costs related to project start-ups are expected to be partially offset by efficiency improvements,” Albemarle stated. “Bromine results are expected to be up on higher volumes with on-going savings initiatives expected to offset inflation.”Shares of Albemarle have been on a stellar run, surging 81% over the past three months as the need for lithium-ion batteries is growing, driven by the global demand for electric vehicles, mobile devices and grid storage. (See Albemarle stock analysis on TipRanks)Nonetheless, Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch reiterated a bullish call on the stock with a $111 price target, as he expects the capital raise to be used for shoring up the company’s capital spending to grow lithium capacity.“Given OEM commitments to increasing EV sales and concerns around material availability to support those ramps, we expect ALB is actively working to complete sales agreements for that capacity to ensure visibility on sufficient returns for those facilities,” Rusch wrote in a note to investors. “We continue to have a constructive bias on EV unit growth and the importance of low-cost, high quality lithium concentrates for advanced battery chemistries to enable EV adoption and see ALB as a leader in the lithium industry.”Following the stock’s sharp rally, the rest of the Street remains sidelined on the stock with a Hold consensus rating. That’s with an average analyst price target of $119.73, implying 29% downside potential lies ahead over the coming 12 months.Related News:AstraZeneca To Supply Another 9M COVID-19 Vaccine Doses After EU NodMicrosoft’s Cloud Services Fuel 2Q Sales Beat; Shares RiseStarbucks’ Profit Outlook Disappoints; Shares Fall",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=5c6f65ed988510514b2c7493801630f83363ecaa896726be16435d89ac9e4fc4
