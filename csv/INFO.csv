Furthermore, June data related to surveys of U.S. manufacturing and service firms by purchasing managers and new home sales data for May are set to be released today.



S&P, Dow, and Nasdaq futures were in the green at the time of writing, with 0.1%, 0.1%, and 0.1% trading higher, respectively.



Companies that are expected to report earnings before the market opens include IHS Markit Ltd. (INFO), Patterson Companies Inc (PDCO), and Winnebago Industries (WGO). Concentrix (CNXC), H. B. Fuller Company (FUL), and KB Home (KBH) are expected to report after the market close.

Recently, the biopharmaceutical innovator announced its results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. Additionally, the company provided an update on its planned acquisition of Grace Therapeutics and the ongoing strategic process for CaPre.

AMT-260 is an advanced gene therapy program for the treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).



The acquisition will expand uniQure’s pipeline of innovative gene therapies for the treatment of neurological disorders. Additionally, it will reinforce the company’s global leadership in the development of gene therapies using miRNA silencing technology.



uniQure CEO Matt Kapusta commented, “The acquisition of Corlieve provides an extraordinary opportunity to transform the lives of hundreds of thousands of patients around the world suffering from epilepsy and aligns with our vision of pursuing unmet medical needs for disorders that impact large populations and can be addressed with gene therapies directed to the CNS and liver.”



Meanwhile, Blackstone Group’s (BX) Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust (BREIT) has inked a deal to acquire Home Partners of America (HPA). The transaction, which awaits certain approvals and customary closing conditions, values the Chicago-based firm at $6 billion and is set to close in the third quarter.



Through the acquisition, Blackstone Real Estate will be able to access a vast portfolio of high-quality homes across the U.S. Furthermore, HPA will join with a strong and experienced management team initiating a resident-led business model.

In other news, AT&T (T) has taken certain steps to fight against calls initiated by fraudsters. As part of its spam-swatting drive, the carrier is now blocking more than 1 billion spam calls every month.

“We are authenticating and verifying hundreds of millions of calls per day, including calls across our wireless network and calls exchanged with the two other leading US wireless providers. We’re also using data from STIR/SHAKEN to help us achieve high accuracy in our blocking and labeling,” AT&T commented in a press release.

Readings above 50 indicate growth.The gain was largely driven by a record expansion in the group’s measure of service business activity. Demand is gathering pace as the recovery from the pandemic propels long-depressed service providers, particularly in leisure and travel.Reports elsewhere showed the euro-area recovery also is increasingly being supported by rebounding services as factories confront a supply squeeze. British business confidence hit an all-time high.Order growth at U.S. manufacturers climbed to a record, though shortages of materials also caused backlogs of work to reach a series high.In addition a gauge of export orders for manufacturers advanced to a 14-year high. Robust domestic and foreign demand is providing factories and services providers the wherewithal to pass along higher input costs. Measures of prices received by factories and services rose to record highs.“With businesses optimistic about the outlook, backlogs of orders rising sharply and demand continuing to pick up both at home and in export markets, the scene is set for strong economic growth to persist through the summer,” Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement.“Average selling prices for goods and services are both rising at unprecedented rates, which will feed through to higher consumer inflation in coming months,” Williamson said.The IHS Markit’s gauges of input prices and new business at service providers also climbed to the highest in data back to 2009.(Adds graphic)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d747b94637ffff37a10aa19f9f9df6428f6ee721e22a8b34c67e2fb2ec39f3dc

Sign up hereEuro-area manufacturers are battling unprecedented delays in securing raw materials and parts, leading to a record build-up of uncompleted orders and rising prices as the economy starts to recover.Factories surveyed by IHS Markit cited a “mismatch of supply and demand” along with transport difficulties -- especially sea freight -- as the main reasons for delays. A gauge of manufacturing activity rose to 62.9 in April, the highest reading in the survey’s 24-year history though slightly below an earlier estimate.Companies reported higher costs for chemicals, metals and plastics and ran down their inventories to cope.“Euro-zone manufacturing is booming,” said Chris Williamson, IHS Markit’s chief business economist. “The consequence of demand running ahead of supply is higher prices being charged by manufacturers, which are now also rising at the fastest rate ever recorded by the survey.”Coronavirus infections and slow progress on vaccinations drove the euro zone into a double-dip recession in the first quarter, leaving the bloc’s economy trailing far behind the U.S. Yet a pickup in inoculations and the prospect that the region’s 800 billion-euro ($963 billion) joint recovery fund will soon kick in has fueled optimism.More Than 1.16 Billion Shots Given: Covid-19 Vaccine TrackerWilliamson said increases in employment and investment in machinery and equipment signaled in the survey may help companies overcome the capacity constraints.“This should help bring supply and demand more into line, taking some pressure off prices,” he said. “But this will inevitably take time.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=47ebc270f45a5833ff50f11ceb50800a8227e118830df9a6ef609c6c4eff371e
