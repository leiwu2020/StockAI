Castle and SBA already hosted Verizon infrastructure equipment. Verizon won an average of 161 MHz of C-band nationwide spectrum in the recent FCC auction. The C-band offered greater speeds and coverage for both mobility, home broadband, and business internet solutions. The 5G Ultra-Wideband deployment on the spectrum required new network equipment, including basebands and antennas on existing towers. The deals with both Crown Castle and SBA Communications offered process improvements leading to Verizon's faster deployment of C-band equipment. Both the agreements established terms for leasing space on existing towers for C-band equipment. The addition of the C-band spectrum will enable Verizon to offer the differentiated 5G Ultra-Wideband mobility service to an additional 250 million customers offering the internet provider choice to 50 million additional customers, stated Verizon SVP Heidi Hemmer.

It was also announced that shareholders of SBA Communications's stock as of March 10, 2021 are entitled to the dividend. The stock is expected to become ex-dividend 1 business day(s) before the record date. SBA Communications has an ex-dividend date set for for March 9, 2021. The company's current dividend payout is $0.58, which equates to a dividend yield of 0.89% at current price levels. What Is An Ex-Dividend Date? An ex-dividend date is when a company's shares stop trading with its current dividend payout in preparation for the company to announce a new one. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Typically, companies will announce and implement new dividend yields on a quarterly basis. SBA Communications's Dividend Performance Over the past year, SBA Communications has seen its dividend payouts and yields climb upward overall. Last year (March 9, 2020), the company's payout sat at $0.47, which has since increased by $0.11. SBA Communications's dividend yield last year was 0.64%, which has since grown by 0.25%. Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market. To read more about SBA Communications click here.

The SBA Communications Analyst: Ric Prentiss upgraded SBA communications' stock rating from Outperform to Strong Buy with an unchanged $309 price target. The SBA Communications Thesis: SBA's stock has lost more than 20% over the past six months amid expectations for higher interest rates and investors flocking towards ""re-opening"" stocks, Prentiss wrote in the upgrade note. However, SBA has two catalysts ahead that would translate to upside potential for the stock. First, REIT-focused funds are likely to seek out exposure to infrastructure stocks like SBA. Second, upcoming analyst day presentations at major cell phone carriers could emphasize the bullish case for tower stocks. Related Link: Benzinga's Top Ratings Upgrades, Downgrades For March 5, 2021 SBA stands out among its peers given: 1) Superior exposure to U.S. towers. 2) Higher quality-adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) to funds available for distribution (FAD) conversion. 3) Expectations for superior dividend growth. 4) A reputation for buying back stock ""opportunistically."" ""All in all, we like all three tower stocks, but think the FAD valuation and AFFO/share and Dividend/share growth profiles are most attractive at SBAC, and we see significant upside,"" the analyst wrote.
