With the investment, the alcohol beverage company expands its footprint to cater to diverse drinkers with common interests. Founded in 2019, La Fête du Rosé has carved a niche for itself as an exceptional liquid and brand. To date, it has donated part of its proceeds to various programs, primarily targeting the under-represented youth and organizations focused on ensuring racial justice. Additionally, the investment affirms Constellation Brand's push to focus on minority groups as part of the Minority Founders initiative. The company plans to invest as much as $100 million as part of the initiative that targets minority-owned businesses by 2030. “Minority-owned businesses are under-represented in our industry and there is a real need to make it more equitable for those businesses to receive access to capital. This initiative enables us to play a role in creating greater equity within our industry and provides an opportunity for us to work with bold leaders and brands with unique value propositions that align with our premiumization strategy,” said Constellation's CEO and President, Bill Newlands. Constellation Brands has been on an investment spree. Early this year, it invested $10 million in the Clear Vision Impact Fund. The investment was part of the company's push to support minority-owned businesses. (See Constellation Brands stock analysis on TipRanks). Last month, Credit Suisse analyst Kaumil Gajrawala reiterated a Buy rating on the stock buoyed by the company’s transition away from a two-branded house. “Capacity is unlikely an issue in the near-term to support HSD growth. We estimate capacity utilization rates touching ~90% by end of FY22 should decline to ~75% by the end of FY25 providing ample capacity breathing room,” said Gajrawala. The analyst has a $260 price target on the stock implying 9.8% upside potential to current levels. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 8 Buy and 3 Hold ratings. The average analyst price target of $260.56 implies 10% upside potential to current levels. STZ scores a 6 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, implying its performance is likely to align with market expectations.

(NYSE: STZ and STZ.B), a leading beverage alcohol company, announced today that it has acquired a minority stake in the fast-rising rosé label, La Fête du Rosé – a brand created to cater to diverse drinkers who share common interests across travel, food, experiences, and wine. The investment was made through Constellation’s venture capital group and represents the first company to receive investment dollars as part of Constellation’s Focus on Minority Founders initiative, which plans to invest $100 million in Black, Latinx, and minority-owned businesses by 2030. “We’re thrilled to jumpstart our Focus on Minority Founders initiative with an investment in a fantastic consumer-oriented brand and with a dynamic and proven industry leader behind it in Donae Burston,” said Bill Newlands, Constellation’s president and chief executive officer. “Minority-owned businesses are under-represented in our industry and there is a real need to make it more equitable for those businesses to receive access to capital. This initiative enables us to play a role in creating greater equity within our industry and provides an opportunity for us to work with bold leaders and brands with unique value propositions that align with our premiumization strategy. La Fête du Rosé is certainly that, as Donae has taken a consumer-first approach to building a distinctive rosé brand that authentically reflects today’s multicultural consumer values.” Founded in 2019 by Burston, a 15-year beverage industry veteran, La Fête du Rosé was inspired by the popularity of rosé in the French peninsula of Saint Tropez but built with the intention of a fresh, modern, and inclusive brand geared toward rosé drinkers of all backgrounds. ""People like to see themselves in anything, and that's what we're trying to do with La Fête du Rosé – create an exceptional liquid and brand that's focused on reaching a wider audience,"" said Burston, founder & CEO of La Fête du Rosé. “It has taken a lot of hard work to get the brand to where it is today. Constellation Brands is the right partner to allow us to scale the brand in a way that stays true to its ethos."" La Fête du Rosé – which translates to ""the rosé party"" – is produced in conjunction with prestigious winemakers from Domaine Bertaud Belieu, the oldest vineyard on the Saint Tropez peninsula established in 1340. The delicious pink wine is known for its refreshing taste, light alcohol content, and drinkability. Since its debut, the brand has donated a portion of its proceeds to various programs that send disadvantaged and underrepresented youth on unique travel experiences and to organizations focused on advancing racial justice and creating opportunities for people of color in the wine & spirits industry. “Donae and the La Fête du Rosé team have created a truly unique and distinctive lifestyle brand, and we’re excited to collaborate with them and share insights to fuel our collective growth,” said Jennifer Evans, vice president, Constellation Ventures. “We look forward to making future investments behind our Focus on Minority Founders initiative and working with brands and companies that align with our strategy of investing in emerging, higher-end brands that have a point of differentiation in the marketplace.” A component of Constellation’s multi-initiative racial justice action plan aimed at achieving greater equity for African American/Black and minority colleagues at Constellation, within the beverage alcohol industry, and within the communities where the company operates, Focus on Minority Founders will support the growth and development of Black and minority-owned businesses by providing funding and access to sales, marketing, operations, and finance expertise through the Constellation Brands Ventures team and Constellation’s many subject matter experts. Earlier this year, Constellation announced a $10 million investment commitment through Focus on Minority Founders in the Clear Vision Impact Fund, LP -- a newly-formed investment vehicle founded by Siebert Williams Shank & Co., LLC, with an objective of making investments in minority-owned businesses, with an emphasis on African American/Black-owned businesses. The initiative is inspired by the success of Constellation’s Focus on Female Founders program, which is committed to investing $100 million in female-owned and founded companies. Since its launch in 2018, Constellation’s Ventures portfolio mix has shifted from 20% female-owned to more than 50% female-owned, reinforcing the need for these initiatives and showing the measurable improvement they can make in promoting greater equity within the beverage alcohol industry. The Focus on Minority Founders application can be found on cbrands.com/story/ventures, and the evaluation process aligns with Constellation’s ventures strategy of investing in emerging, unique and distinctive brands. Constellation Brands Ventures continues to look for brands that have a point of differentiation in the market; companies that want to welcome Constellation Ventures as an active minority investor; organizations looking to grow beyond their current markets; and entrepreneurs who want to grow their business with the support of Constellation’s investment, mentorship, and involvement.

But in terms of growth, these sectors can often struggle, meaning investors may have to forfeit growth in exchange for stability. While that certainly has appeal for a lot of investors, income investors looking for growth may need to look to alternative sectors. One such sector is the cannabis industry. While cannabis is still in the early stages, there are some companies with exposure to cannabis that offer investors exposure to the high growth potential of cannabis, but also pay dividends to shareholders. There is even a cannabis Real Estate Investment Trust, typically a popular asset class among income investors. Investors often have to make the choice between growth or dividends, but with cannabis-related stocks, sometimes they come from the same place. In this article, we’ll highlight three stocks that we see as favorable stocks to gain exposure to the burgeoning cannabis industry, while also receiving dividends.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 7 Stocks to Buy Right Now With All Eyes on Crypto Here are 3 cannabis stocks to buy for growth and high dividends: Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:IIPR) The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG) Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) The three stocks highlighted here have very different ways of benefiting from cannabis utilization, and all three offer different growth paths and levels of dividend safety and yield. Still, for investors looking for growth and dividends, cannabis has become an increasingly accepted way to achieve both. Cannabis Stocks to Buy: Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR) Source: Shutterstock Our first stock is an REIT that’s nearly a pure play on the industry, specializing in properties used to cultivate and sell cannabis products. IIPR is the only cannabis-related REIT that has been approved for trading on the major U.S. stock exchanges, so investor capital has flocked to the stock since it became publicly-traded. IIPR owns 69 properties in 17 U.S. states, and those numbers are growing rapidly. The trust is widely regarded as the fastest-growing REIT in the market today, but that hasn’t stopped it from being a serious income stock very early on in its life. The trust’s most recent earnings report showed extremely strong year-over-year growth, with adjusted funds-from-operations (FFO) of $37 million in Q4, more than double the year-ago period. The trust acquired four new properties during the quarter and expanded an existing property, totaling 848 thousand rentable square feet. The trust also collected 100% of its contracted rent during the quarter, in contrast to many REITs with pandemic-stricken customers that are struggling with sluggish demand. We currently project 25% FFO-per-share annual growth for the next five years as IIPR continues to raise capital and expand aggressively, which is helping it to grow its FFO on a dollar basis. The trust is issuing common shares at an aggressive rate as well, which will cause FFO on a per-share basis to rise much less quickly than on a dollar basis. Still, we see close to $20 in FFO-per-share in 2026, after accounting for a rapid rise in the share count. IIPR has raised its dividend payout very quickly since becoming publicly-traded, and we project it will pay out 85% of its FFO this year in dividends. That gives the stock a nice 3% current yield, with room for future increases as its FFO is likely to continue growing at a high rate. The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (SMG) Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com Our next stock is one that many investors may find surprising in its access to the cannabis sector, Scotts Miracle-Gro. Scotts is one of the world’s largest lawn and garden companies, selling everything from fertilizer and grass seed to outdoor cleaners, weed killers, disease control products and more. Scotts’ products began to be used in the production of cannabis in earnest a few quarters ago, and shares have skyrocketed on the growth potential. Specifically, its subsidiary The Hawthorne Gardening Company provides nutrients, lighting and other materials used in the indoor and hydroponic growing segment. The company’s first quarter earnings report showed its first-ever profit during the what is the slowest time of year for Scott’s, highlighting the strength the company has seen in recent quarters. Sales more than doubled in Q1 from the year-ago period, hitting a record of $749 million. Demand was strong in all categories of indoor growing products, as consumers stayed at home and tended gardens and indoor plants with Scotts products. Growth was pronounced in the Hawthorne segment, which grew sales by 66% last quarter. Earnings-per-share came to 39 cents, which was up sharply from a loss of $1.12 per share in the year-ago period. The company is struggling to replicate recent growth, but there is still plenty of room for continued expansion. Management expects Hawthorne to grow full-year sales by 30% to 40%. 7 Stocks to Buy Right Now With All Eyes on Crypto Scotts scores very high for dividend safety, with our projection of the stock’s payout ratio at just 30% for this year. That leaves Scotts ample room to raise the payout in the coming years and weather any potential earnings downturn. The stock has a 1% dividend yield, with a high dividend growth rate. Constellation Brands (STZ) Source: Shutterstock Constellation Brands is perhaps another surprising cannabis stock, as it is mostly known for its dominating beer and spirit brands. However, Constellation owns a large stake in Canopy Growth (NASDAQ:CGC), which is worth about 39% of the company, or $3.8 billion at CGC stock’s current market capitalization. Constellation’s fourth quarter earnings results showed a modest 2.6% increase in sales to $1.95 billion, as soaring beer sales offset declining wine and spirits sales, which was attributable to divestitures. For the year, the company saw revenue rise just over 3% to $8.6 billion, and earnings-per-share rise from $9.12 to $9.97 on an adjusted basis. Excluding the investment in Canopy, earnings-per-share would have been $10.44, as Canopy has thus far been a money loser for Constellation. We expect 5% annualized growth from Constellation in the coming years, fueled by ever-stronger demand from its core beer portfolio. In addition, we see the rapid growth of Canopy as having the potential to boost its growth rate, although we remind investors that Constellation owns a very large portion of a highly speculative cannabis stock with an extremely high valuation. Like Scotts, Constellation scores high for dividend safety, with its payout at 30% of earnings for the year. We see no dividend safety issues upcoming for Constellation, and indeed expect the payout to be raised for many years to come.

However, shares declined 4.6% to close at $224.21 on April 8 as the US producer and marketer of beer, wine, and spirits provided downbeat guidance for fiscal 2022. Constellation Brands’ (STZ) 4Q adjusted earnings excluding canopy decreased 11% to $1.93 per share on a year-over-year basis but beat Street estimates of $1.55 per share. Net sales jumped 3% to $1.95 billion and surpassed analysts’ expectations of $1.87 billion. The company’s beer business reported an 18% year-over-year growth in organic net sales, while wine and spirits reported an 8% rise in the quarter. (See Constellation Brands stock analysis on TipRanks) Constellation Brands’ CFO Garth Hankinson commented, “In fiscal 2022, we expect to continue to have significant capital allocation flexibility, which will enable ongoing progress in returning cash to shareholders while making strategic investments to support long-term growth opportunities.” For fiscal 2022, the company projects adjusted earnings to be in the range of $9.95-$10.25 per share versus the consensus estimate of $10.44 per share. The outlook assumptions include beer net sales growth of 7%-9% and wine and spirits net sales decline of 22%-24%, among others. Following the 4Q results, MKM Partners analyst William Kirk maintained a Hold rating and a price target of $219 (2.3% downside potential) on the stock. Kirk said, “Constellation continues to impress with unrelenting demand for Modelo Especial. Intrinsics (lower calorie and brand authenticity) and Demographics remain very strong for the brand. However, we still are unsure if Seltzer innovation and Wine performance will be enough to drive upside.” The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 5 analysts suggesting a Buy and 3 analysts recommending a Hold. The average analyst price target of $251.33 implies 12.1% upside potential to current levels.
