The deal includes $714 million (€600 million) to be paid in cash for Mobidiag’s equity and net debt of $81 million. Hologic (HOLX) intends to finance the acquisition with existing cash and by borrowing on its line of credit. The transaction, which awaits regulatory approval, is anticipated to close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Mobidiag, a privately held, commercial-stage Finnish-French developer of innovative molecular diagnostic tests and instrumentation, develops and markets PCR-based (polymerase chain reaction) tests for severe conditions including gastrointestinal and respiratory infections, antimicrobial resistance management, and healthcare related infections. The Amplidiag and Novodiag platforms are automated instruments, which deliver quick turnaround times ranging from 50 minutes to two hours. Notably, Mobidiag recorded revenue of $42 million (€35 million) in the 2020 calendar year. Hologic’s plan of investing in assay development to drive growth of the Novodiag platform is likely to be $0.10 dilutive to Hologic’s adjusted EPS in fiscal 2022, slightly dilutive in 2023, and accretive thereafter. (See Hologic stock analysis on TipRanks) Hologic’s International Group President Jan Verstreken commented, “Acquiring Mobidiag will further strengthen our international and diagnostics businesses by enabling us to expand into the large, fast-growing acute care adjacency with a near-patient testing solution that offers ease of use, multiplex capability and rapid turnaround time. We believe that Mobidiag has developed a differentiated platform that addresses many of the historical challenges of multiplexed point-of-care molecular testing.” Following the deal announcement, Needham analyst Michael Matson reiterated a Hold rating. Matson said, “We believe the Mobidiag acquisition adds a new testing vertical for HOLX, expanding its mostly high volume/reference laboratory-based high-throughput testing (i.e., Panther platform) offering to include sample-to-answer and point-of-care hospital testing for rapid diagnostics (Novodiag platform).” Furthermore, “Given the financial windfall that has resulted from HOLX’s COVID-19 test sales,” the analyst expects “HOLX to remain active with M&A.” “We believe that HOLX shares are fairly valued considering its post-COVID-19 earnings power,” Matson added. Hologic shares have exploded 79% over the past year, while the stock still scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 6 Buys versus 1 Hold. That’s alongside an average analyst price target of $96, which implies 31% upside potential to current levels. Furthermore, Hologic scores a “Perfect 10” from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

Shares of Hologic, which closed 4% higher on Tuesday, have gained 46.5% over the past 12 months.Hologic (HOLX) said that Biotheranostics provides molecular diagnostic tests for cancer, and therefore, the deal would help the company expand its presence in the fast-growing oncology market.The deal is likely to close in February and “is expected to be slightly dilutive to Hologic’s non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal 2021, break-even in 2022, and accretive thereafter,” the company said.“Acquiring Biotheranostics enables us to jump-start our entry into a large, fast-growing oncology adjacency that fits perfectly with our broader corporate focus and passion for women’s health,” said Kevin Thornal, president of Hologic’s diagnostics division.  (See HOLX stock analysis on TipRanks)Following the deal, Needham analyst Michael Matson said, “HOLX is a leader in the infectious disease testing market and we believe the Biotheranostics acquisition allows HOLX to expand into the adjacent oncology market.” The analyst added, “Given the financial windfall that has resulted from HOLX's COVID-19 test sales, we expect HOLX to remain active with M&A in CY21.” Notably, Hologic has recently acquired Somatex Medical Technologies for approximately $64 million. However, Matson still maintained a Hold rating on the stock, as he believes that, “HOLX shares are fairly valued considering its post-COVID-19 earnings power.”Currently, the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock, with a Moderate Buy analyst consensus based on 8 Buys and 3 Holds. Meanwhile, the average price target stands at $90.11, which indicates upside potential of 18.5%.
