(“Medline”) for $286 million in cash, reduced by $12 million in working capital not transferring to Medline. The Teleflex respiratory product lines that will be divested include oxygen and aerosol therapy, active humidification, non-invasive ventilation, and incentive spirometers, which generated $139 million in revenue in 2020. The transaction is expected to close early in the third quarter of 2021, subject to customary regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. “Following a comprehensive review of our strategy and core capabilities, our Board of Directors and management team decided that divesting a significant portion of our Respiratory business will enable Teleflex to focus further on executing in our core market segments to drive long-term sustainable growth and increase shareholder value,” said Liam Kelly, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Teleflex. “We expect the proceeds from the divestiture of this business, along with our ability to continue to generate cash from operations, to help us on our journey to execute our strategic plan.” In addition, Mr. Kelly noted, “Following a strong first quarter 2021 performance and the continued recovery in April as outlined on our first quarter 2021 earnings call, we feel confident in maintaining our 2021 full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range, even in light of the dilution from the sale of the respiratory assets. We look forward to providing a full financial update to investors on our second quarter 2021 earnings call. Importantly, this transaction is accretive to our pro-forma revenue growth profile, as well as adjusted gross and operating margins longer term.” Financial ImplicationsIn 2021, the respiratory product lines that will be divested were expected to generate net revenue approximately flat with the $139 million generated in 2020. Assuming a close to the transaction early in the third quarter of 2021, the company estimates a revenue headwind of $28-32 million and adjusted earnings per share dilution of $0.10-$0.15 in 2021 or approximately 1% of 2021 adjusted earnings per share, net of a manufacturing services agreement that we plan to enter into with Medline upon the initial closing of the sale transaction. The Company intends to use the divestiture proceeds to pay down debt, augmenting its financial flexibility to support its growth strategy.

We estimate that we will incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges of $7 million to $9 million, consisting primarily of termination benefits. In addition, we expect to incur $3 million to $4 million in restructuring related charges, most of which are expected to be recognized in cost of sales. We expect this program will be substantially completed by the end of 2021. We expect to begin realizing plan-related savings in 2021 and expect to achieve annual pre-tax savings of $13 million to $16 million once the plan is fully implemented. 2021 OUTLOOK The Company raised its full year 2021 GAAP revenue growth estimates from a range of between 10.0% and 11.5% over 2020, to a range of between 10.50% and 11.75% over 2020, reflecting our estimate of an approximately 2% favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, the Company raised its full year 2021 revenue growth estimates from a range of between 8.0% and 9.5% over 2020, to a range of between 8.50% and 9.75% over 2020.

An audio replay will be available until May 6, 2021 at 11:59pm (ET), by calling 800-585-8367 (U.S./Canada) or 416-621-4642 (International), Passcode: 6194708. ADDITIONAL NOTES References in this release to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on adjusted diluted earnings per share include both the impact of translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on foreign currency denominated transactions. In the discussion of segment results, ""new products"" refers to products for which we initiated commercial sales within the past 36 months and ""existing products"" refers to products we have sold commercially for more than 36 months. Certain financial information is presented on a rounded basis, which may cause minor differences. Segment results and commentary exclude the impact of discontinued operations. NOTES ON NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES We report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, commonly referred to as “GAAP.” In this press release, we provide supplemental information, consisting of the following non-GAAP financial measures: constant currency revenue growth and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures are described in more detail below. Management uses these financial measures to assess Teleflex’s financial performance, make operating decisions, allocate financial resources, provide guidance on possible future results, and assist in its evaluation of period-to-period and peer comparisons. The non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors because they provide insight into management’s assessment of our business, and provide supplemental information pertinent to a comparison of period-to-period results of our ongoing operations. The non-GAAP financial measures are presented in addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Moreover, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Tables reconciling changes in historical constant currency net revenues to historical GAAP net revenues are set forth above under “Net Revenue by Segment"" and ""Net Revenue by Global Product Category"". Tables reconciling historical adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to historical GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are set forth below. Constant currency revenue growth: This non-GAAP measure is based upon net revenues, adjusted to eliminate the impact of translating the results of international subsidiaries at different currency exchange rates from period to period. The impact of changes in foreign currency may vary significantly from period to period, and such changes generally are outside of the control of our management. We believe that this measure facilitates a comparison of our operating performance exclusive of currency exchange rate fluctuations that do not reflect our underlying performance or business trends. Adjusted diluted earnings per share: This non-GAAP measure is based upon diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, adjusted to exclude, depending on the period presented, the items described below. Management does not believe that any of the excluded items are indicative of our underlying core performance or business trends. Restructuring, restructuring related and impairment items - Restructuring programs involve discrete initiatives designed to, among other things, consolidate or relocate manufacturing, administrative and other facilities, outsource distribution operations, improve operating efficiencies and integrate acquired businesses. Depending on the specific restructuring program involved, our restructuring charges may include employee termination, contract termination, facility closure, employee relocation, equipment relocation, outplacement and other exit costs associated with the restructuring program. Restructuring related charges are directly related to our restructuring programs and consist of facility consolidation costs, including accelerated depreciation expense related to facility closures, costs to transfer manufacturing operations between locations, and retention bonuses offered to certain employees as an incentive for them to remain with our company after completion of the restructuring program. Impairment charges occur if, due to events or changes in circumstances, we determine that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value. Impairment charges do not directly affect our liquidity, but could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results. Acquisition, integration and divestiture related items - Acquisition and integration expenses are incremental charges, other than restructuring or restructuring related expenses, that are directly related to specific business or asset acquisition transactions. These charges may include, among other things, professional, consulting and other fees; systems integration costs; legal entity restructuring expense; inventory step-up amortization (amortization, through cost of goods sold, of the increase in fair value of inventory resulting from a fair value calculation as of the acquisition date); fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities; and bridge loan facility and backstop financing fees in connection with loan facilities that ultimately were not utilized. Divestiture related activities involve specific business or asset sales. Depending primarily on the terms of a divestiture transaction, the carrying value of the divested business or assets on our financial statements and other costs we incur as a direct result of the divestiture transaction, we may recognize a gain or loss in connection with the divestiture related activities. Other items - These are discrete items that occur sporadically and can affect period-to-period comparisons. See footnote C to the reconciliation tables set forth below. European medical device regulation - The European Union (“EU”) has adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”), which replaces the existing Medical Devices Directive (“MDD”) and imposes more stringent requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices in the EU, including requirements affecting clinical evaluations, quality systems and post-market surveillance. Manufacturers of currently marketed medical devices will have until May 2021 to meet the MDR requirements, although certain devices that previously satisfied MDD requirements can continue to be marketed in the EU until May 2024, subject to certain limitations. Significantly, the MDR will require the re-registration of previously approved medical devices. As a result, Teleflex will incur expenditures in connection with the new registration of medical devices that previously had been registered under the MDD. Therefore, these expenditures are not considered to be ordinary course expenditures in connection with regulatory matters (in contrast, no adjustment has been made to exclude expenditures related to the registration of medical devices that were not registered previously under the MDD). Intangible amortization expense - Certain intangible assets, including customer relationships, intellectual property, distribution rights, trade names and non-competition agreements, initially are recorded at historical cost and then amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. The amount of such amortization can vary from period to period as a result of, among other things, business or asset acquisitions or dispositions. Tax adjustments - These adjustments represent the impact of the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations for prior year returns, the resolution of audits, the filing of amended returns with respect to prior tax years and/or tax law or certain other discrete changes affecting our deferred tax liability.

CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION This press release contains forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding the restructuring plan we committed to in the first quarter of 2021, including with respect to the pre-tax restructuring and restructuring-related charges we expect to incur in connection with the plan, pre-tax savings we expect to achieve once the plan has been fully implemented and the expected timing for when the plan will be substantially completed; forecasted 2021 GAAP and constant currency revenue growth and GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share; and our estimates regarding the projected impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our 2021 financial results. Actual results could differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements due to, among other things, the adverse economic conditions associated with the COVID-19 global health pandemic and the associated financial crisis, stay-at-home and other orders, which may significantly reduce customer spending and which may have a negative impact on the Company’s business, changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers or suppliers; delays or cancellations in shipments; demand for and market acceptance of new and existing products; our inability to provide products to our customers, which may be due to, among other things, events that impact key distributors, suppliers and third-party vendors that sterilize our products; our inability to integrate acquired businesses into our operations, realize planned synergies and operate such businesses profitably in accordance with our expectations; the inability of acquired businesses to generate revenues in accordance with our expectations; our inability to effectively execute our restructuring plans and programs; our inability to realize anticipated savings from restructuring plans and programs; the impact of healthcare reform legislation and proposals to amend, replace or repeal the legislation; changes in Medicare, Medicaid and third party coverage and reimbursements; the impact of enacted tax legislation and related regulations; competitive market conditions and resulting effects on revenues and pricing; increases in raw material costs that cannot be recovered in product pricing; global economic factors, including currency exchange rates, interest rates, trade disputes, sovereign debt issues and the impact of the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union, commonly known as ""Brexit""; public health epidemics; difficulties in entering new markets; general economic conditions; and other factors described or incorporated in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as otherwise specifically stated by us or as required by law or regulation.

In the United States alone, more than 42 million men are affected by BPH and approximately 12 million men are under a doctor’s care for the condition.1 This common, non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate occurs as men age and can interrupt sleep, cause urinary problems, and decrease quality of life.2 “The UroLift System is a standard of care in my practice, and I confidently recommend it to appropriate patients who face the challenge of an enlarging prostate,” said Wayne Kuang, M.D.a “Many men are looking for alternatives to medications and major surgeries that have unwanted side effects and risks. The UroLift System may enable men to experience rapid symptom relief, recover from the procedure quickly, and return to their normal routines with minimal downtime.3,4 This minimally invasive procedure can achieve consistent results in a broad range of BPH patients with various anatomies and a wide range of sizes.” “Celebrating 250,000 patients treated with the UroLift System is an exciting milestone. We thank the physicians in our community who recommend the UroLift System to their patients,” said Tyler Binney, President of the Teleflex Interventional Urology business unit. “Recent clinical data show the UroLift System provides a superior patient experience with better sexual function, lower catheterization rates, less interference with daily activities, and higher patient satisfaction in the early recovery period.b,5 Patients treated with the UroLift System may also achieve better outcomes in sexual function and satisfaction than men who receive medical therapy.c,8 These positive UroLift System outcomes align with our goal at Teleflex to improve the health and quality of patients’ lives.” About the UroLift® SystemThe UroLift® System is a minimally invasive treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It is indicated for the treatment of symptoms of an enlarged prostate up to 100cc in men 45 years or older. The UroLift permanent implants, delivered during an outpatient procedure, relieve prostate obstruction without heating, cutting, destruction or removing prostate tissue. The UroLift System is the only leading BPH procedure shown to not cause new onset, sustained erectile or ejaculatory dysfunction.d,3,6,7 Most common adverse events are temporary and can include hematuria, dysuria, micturition urgency, pelvic pain, and urge incontinence.3 Rare side effects, including bleeding and infection, may lead to a serious outcome and may require intervention. Individual results may vary. The prostatic urethral lift procedure (using the UroLift System) is recommended for the treatment of BPH in both the American Urological Association and European Association of Urology clinical guidelines. More than 250,000 men have been treated with the UroLift System in select markets worldwide.e Learn more at www.UroLift.com.

OTHER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS AND KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS Depreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets and deferred financing charges for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $231.7 million compared to $218.4 million for the prior year. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 were $375.9 million compared to $301.1 million at December 31, 2019. Net accounts receivable at December 31, 2020 were $395.1 million compared to $418.7 million at December 31, 2019. Net inventories at December 31, 2020 were $513.2 million compared to $476.6 million at December 31, 2019. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $437.1 million during 2020, as compared to $437.1 million during 2019. In 2020, the cash flow from operations reflect an increase in contingent consideration payments and tax payments that were mainly offset by favorable changes in other working capital. The favorable changes in other working capital were driven mainly by higher accounts receivable collections. 2021 OUTLOOK On a GAAP basis, full year 2021 revenues are expected to increase between 10.0% and 11.5% over 2020, reflecting our estimate of an approximately 2% favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, the Company estimates that revenues for full year 2021 will increase between 8.0% and 9.5% over 2020. The Company expects full year 2021 GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $8.15 and $8.25. The Company expects adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $12.50 and $12.70 for full year 2021, representing an increase of between 17.2% and 19.0% over 2020.

ADDITIONAL NOTES References in this release to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on adjusted diluted earnings per share include both the impact of translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on foreign currency denominated transactions. In the discussion of segment results, ""new products"" refers to products for which we initiated commercial sales within the past 36 months and ""existing products"" refers to products we have sold commercially for more than 36 months. Certain financial information is presented on a rounded basis, which may cause minor differences. Segment results and commentary exclude the impact of discontinued operations. NOTES ON NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES We report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, commonly referred to as “GAAP.” In this press release, we provide supplemental information, consisting of the following non-GAAP financial measures: constant currency revenue growth and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures are described in more detail below. Management uses these financial measures to assess Teleflex’s financial performance, make operating decisions, allocate financial resources, provide guidance on possible future results, and assist in its evaluation of period-to-period and peer comparisons. The non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors because they provide insight into management’s assessment of our business, and provide supplemental information pertinent to a comparison of period-to-period results of our ongoing operations. The non-GAAP financial measures are presented in addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Moreover, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Tables reconciling changes in historical constant currency net revenues to historical GAAP net revenues are set forth above under “Net Revenue by Segment"" and ""Net Revenue by Global Product Category"". Tables reconciling historical adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to historical GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are set forth below. Constant currency revenue growth: This non-GAAP measure is based upon net revenues, adjusted to eliminate the impact of translating the results of international subsidiaries at different currency exchange rates from period to period. The impact of changes in foreign currency may vary significantly from period to period, and such changes generally are outside of the control of our management. We believe that this measure facilitates a comparison of our operating performance exclusive of currency exchange rate fluctuations that do not reflect our underlying performance or business trends. Adjusted diluted earnings per share: This non-GAAP measure is based upon diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, adjusted to exclude, depending on the period presented, the items described below. Management does not believe that any of the excluded items are indicative of our underlying core performance or business trends. Restructuring, restructuring related and impairment items - Restructuring programs involve discrete initiatives designed to, among other things, consolidate or relocate manufacturing, administrative and other facilities, outsource distribution operations, improve operating efficiencies and integrate acquired businesses. Depending on the specific restructuring program involved, our restructuring charges may include employee termination, contract termination, facility closure, employee relocation, equipment relocation, outplacement and other exit costs associated with the restructuring program. Restructuring related charges are directly related to our restructuring programs and consist of facility consolidation costs, including accelerated depreciation expense related to facility closures, costs to transfer manufacturing operations between locations, and retention bonuses offered to certain employees as an incentive for them to remain with our company after completion of the restructuring program. Impairment charges occur if, due to events or changes in circumstances, we determine that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value. Impairment charges do not directly affect our liquidity, but could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results. Acquisition, integration and divestiture related items - Acquisition and integration expenses are incremental charges, other than restructuring or restructuring related expenses, that are directly related to specific business or asset acquisition transactions. These charges may include, among other things, professional, consulting and other fees; systems integration costs; legal entity restructuring expense; inventory step-up amortization (amortization, through cost of goods sold, of the increase in fair value of inventory resulting from a fair value calculation as of the acquisition date); fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities; and bridge loan facility and backstop financing fees in connection with loan facilities that ultimately were not utilized. Divestiture related activities involve specific business or asset sales. Depending primarily on the terms of a divestiture transaction, the carrying value of the divested business or assets on our financial statements and other costs we incur as a direct result of the divestiture transaction, we may recognize a gain or loss in connection with the divestiture related activities. Other items - These are discrete items that occur sporadically and can affect period-to-period comparisons. See footnote C to the reconciliation tables set forth below. European medical device regulation - The European Union (“EU”) has adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”), which replaces the existing Medical Devices Directive (“MDD”) and imposes more stringent requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices in the EU, including requirements affecting clinical evaluations, quality systems and post-market surveillance. Manufacturers of currently marketed medical devices will have until May 2021 to meet the MDR requirements, although certain devices that previously satisfied MDD requirements can continue to be marketed in the EU until May 2024, subject to certain limitations. Significantly, the MDR will require the re-registration of previously approved medical devices. As a result, Teleflex will incur expenditures in connection with the new registration of medical devices that previously had been registered under the MDD. Therefore, these expenditures are not considered to be ordinary course expenditures in connection with regulatory matters (in contrast, no adjustment has been made to exclude expenditures related to the registration of medical devices that were not registered previously under the MDD). Intangible amortization expense - Certain intangible assets, including customer relationships, intellectual property, distribution rights, trade names and non-competition agreements, initially are recorded at historical cost and then amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. The amount of such amortization can vary from period to period as a result of, among other things, business or asset acquisitions or dispositions. Tax adjustments - These adjustments represent the impact of the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations for prior year returns, the resolution of audits, the filing of amended returns with respect to prior tax years and/or tax law or certain other discrete changes affecting our deferred tax liability.

CTOs are longstanding complete blockages in coronary arteries that result in profound regional reduction of coronary blood flow (ischemia). Clinically significant CTOs are found in nearly 20% of patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography for suspected ischemic heart disease.1 Often a source of limiting symptoms, CTOs may also contribute to cardiac dysfunction and are associated with poor prognosis.2 The principal investigators of the study include David E. Kandzari, MD3, Director, Interventional Cardiology and Chief of the Piedmont Heart Institute and Cardiovascular Service Line, Atlanta, GA, and Dimitri Karmpaliotis, MD, Director of CTO, Complex and High-Risk PCI at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. “The fast enrollment in the CTO-PCI study reflects the strong interest in further advancing contemporary techniques in CTO revascularization—the most demanding PCI environment,” said Dr. Kandzari. In addition to measuring procedure success and the absence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), the study is evaluating the frequency of successful recanalization, frequency of MACE in-hospital and at 30 days post-procedure, frequency of clinically significant perforation, procedural success according to crossing technique, and technical success (defined as successful guidewire recanalization using Teleflex study devices). Enrolling 30 of the 150 patients, Khaldoon Alaswad, MD3, Director, Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory at Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI, was the lead enroller in the study. “The study results will enhance the CTO-PCI skill set and inform interventionalists about the performance of the Teleflex product line in CTO procedures,” said Dr. Alaswad. Study devices include the GuideLiner® V3 catheter, TrapLiner® catheter, Turnpike® catheter, and a series of five coronary guidewires (SpectreTM Guidewire, R350TM Guidewire, RaiderTM Guidewire, WarriorTM Guidewire and BanditTM Guidewire). Each study device is currently commercially available in the US under a more general indication. These products are investigational devices for clinical evaluation as used in the CTO-PCI study. “We are very encouraged by the brisk enrollment in the CTO-PCI IDE study and look forward to the results,” said Teleflex Medical Director, Dr. Christopher Buller.

Hemostasis refers to the process that helps to prevent and stop bleeding.Teleflex (TFX) also acquired certain tax attributes worth $40 million towards future tax benefits. The global provider of medical technologies intends to fund the acquisition through borrowings under its revolving credit facility. The acquisition has an estimated revenue and adjusted EPS generation potential of $60-$70 million and $0.07-$0.15, respectively for FY21. The company expects a high-single digit revenue growth and further accretion to adjusted EPS beyond FY21. Earlier this month, SVB Leerink analyst Richard Newitter raised the price target on TFX stock from $415 to $450 and reiterated a Buy rating. The new price target implies upside potential of close to 11%.Recent meetings with the company's management reinforced Newitter’s bullish view that Teleflex remained one of the more attractive revenue growth and margin expansion stories in mid/large-cap MedTech, with highly visibility to improving top/bottom line growth momentum through 2022-plus.
