On May 6, DENTSPLY reported strong Q1 results. Total revenues came in at $1.03 billion which surpassed the Street’s estimates of $948.7 million and grew 17.5% from the year-ago period. Earnings of $0.72 per share were also above the consensus estimates of $0.56 per share and increased 67.4% year-over-year.



Following the Q1 earnings announcement, H.C. Wainwright analyst Yi Chen reiterated a Hold rating on the stock but increased his price target to $72.00 from $60.00. This implies 8.6% upside potential to current levels.



Chen said, “The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to continue its subsidence in major global markets as COVID-19 vaccines get wider distribution, which should help the company achieve solid growth in 2021 as it implements the strategy of growing revenue and expanding margins.”



The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 5 Buys versus 3 Holds. The average analyst price target of $73.75 implies 11.3% upside potential to current levels. Shares have increased 23.7% over the past six months.

These Non-GAAP measures may differ from those used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The Company discloses these measures to allow investors to evaluate the performance of the Company’s operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period and which may not be indicative of past or future performance of the normal operations of the Company. The Company believes that this information is helpful in understanding underlying operating results including net sales, operating income, and net income. Organic Sales The Company defines ""organic sales"" as the increase or decrease in net sales excluding: (1) net sales from acquired and divested businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition or divestiture, (2) net sales attributable to discontinued product lines in both the current and prior year periods, and (3) the impact of foreign currency translation, which is calculated by translating current period sales using the comparable prior periods currency conversion rates. Organic sales is an important internal measure for the Company. The Company's senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes organic sales and the performance of the Company is measured on this metric along with other performance metrics. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Diluted Common Share The adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Dentsply Sirona consists of net income (loss) attributable to Dentsply Sirona adjusted to exclude the following: (1) Business combination related costs and fair value adjustments. These adjustments include costs related to consummating and integrating acquired businesses, as well as net gains and losses related to the disposed businesses. In addition, this category includes the subsequent impact roll-off to the consolidated statements of operations which results from fair value adjustments related to business combinations, except for amortization expense of purchased intangible assets noted below. Although the Company is regularly engaged in activities to find and act on opportunities for strategic growth and enhancement of product offerings, the costs associated with these activities may vary significantly between periods based on the timing, size and complexity of acquisitions and as such may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company. They are therefore excluded to allow investors to better understand underlying operating trends. (2) Restructuring program related costs and other costs. These adjustments include costs related to the implementation of restructuring initiatives as well as certain other costs. These costs can include, but are not limited to, severance costs, facility closure costs, lease and contract termination costs and related professional service costs, duplicate facility and labor costs associated with specific restructuring initiatives. Other costs include legal settlements and impairments of assets. The Company's restructuring programs usually require several years to fully implement and the Company is continually seeking to take actions that could enhance its efficiency. While restructuring charges are recurring, they are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to the varying levels of restructuring activity and the inherent imprecision in the estimates used to recognize the impairment of assets and the wide variety of costs and taxes associated with severance and termination benefits in the countries in which the restructuring actions occur. (3) Amortization of purchased intangible assets. This adjustment excludes the periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets recorded in purchase accounting. Although these costs contribute to revenue generation and will recur in future periods, their amounts are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions. (4) Credit risk and fair value adjustments. These adjustments include both the cost and income impacts of adjustments in certain assets and liabilities including the Company’s pension obligations, that are recorded through net income which are related to the changes in fair value and credit risk. Although this non-service component of pension expense is a recurring item, it is subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to changes in actuarial assumptions, global financial markets (including stock market returns and interest rate changes), plan changes, settlements, curtailments, and other changes in facts and circumstances. These items can be variable and driven more by market conditions than the Company’s operating performance. (5) Income tax related adjustments. These adjustments include both income tax expenses and income tax benefits that are representative of income tax adjustments mostly related to prior periods, as well as the final settlement of income tax audits, and discrete tax items resulting from the implementation of restructuring initiatives and the vesting and exercise of employee share-based compensation. Income tax related adjustments may also include the impact to adjust the interim effective income tax rate to the expected annual effective tax rate. These adjustments are irregular in timing the variability in amounts may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and therefore are excluded for comparability purposes. Both adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EPS are important internal measures for the Company. The Company's senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EPS. The performance of the Company is measured on these metrics along with other performance metrics. Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) and Margin In addition to reporting operating income (loss) in accordance with US GAAP, the Company provides adjusted operating income (loss) and margin. The Company defines ""adjusted operating income (loss)"" as operating income (loss) in accordance with US GAAP excluding certain items noted above which are excluded on a pre-tax basis to arrive at adjusted operating income (loss), a Non-GAAP measure. The adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income (loss) by net sales. Both adjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating margin are important internal measures for the Company. The Company's senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes adjusted operating income (loss) and margin. The performance of the Company is measured on these metrics along with the adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EPS metrics noted above as well as other performance metrics. DENTSPLY SIRONA INC.

(“Dentsply” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: XRAY) on behalf of the Company’s long-term stockholders. Recently a securities fraud complaint was filed against Dentsply in federal court on behalf of investors who purchased shares of the Company’s stock between February 20, 2014 and August 7, 2018. According to the complaint, during that time period Dentsply and certain of the Company’s senior executive officers engaged in a “years-long scheme” to conceal from the market the Company’s true financial and operating condition. As further alleged in the complaint, Dentsply’s investors learned the truth about the Company’s financial condition through a series of corrective disclosures that revealed: (i) the dire impact of the inventory backlog caused by the minimum purchase requirements on the Company’s revenues, margins and earnings; (ii) that the SEC had opened an investigation into the Company’s accounting and disclosures “relating to transactions with a significant distributor of the Company”; and (iii) billion dollar impairments to the Company’s goodwill that resulted from the inventory backlog. In total, Dentsply’s stock price declined over 45% in value from its Class Period high following the disclosures about the Company’s true financial and operating condition. The firm’s investigation seeks to determine whether the members of Dentsply’s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to Dentsply and its stockholders in connection with the above alleged misconduct. Current Dentsply stockholders who purchased or acquired shares of the company’s stock prior to August 7, 2018 are encouraged to contact Kaskela Law LLC (D. Seamus Kaskela, Esq.) at (484) 258 – 1585, or by email at skaskela@kaskelalaw.com or online at https://kaskelalaw.com/case/dentsply/, to discuss this investigation and their legal rights and options.

In that case, as long as the insiders publish their trades in timely fashion, in accordance with SEC rules, the insider trades are perfectly legal.The SEC rules don’t make the insiders’ knowledge more readily available, but they do make the insiders’ trades easy to follow. And following corporate officers, to see what trades they make and when, can make a viable strategy for retail investors. Bearing this in mind, we’ve used data from the TipRanks Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool to find three stocks that are showing recent – and informative – insider buys. A dive into the stock data and the analyst commentary may provide some additional insight.Dominion Energy, Inc. (D)We’re starting in the energy industry, with a power utility company. Richmond, Virginia-based Dominion has its hands in the electricity and natural gas sectors, with electric utility customers in Virginia and both Carolinas, and natural gas customers in West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, the Carolinas, and Georgia, along with parts of Utah out west.The past year has not been kind to Dominion, and EPS is down from 2019. In the recently reported Q4, the company reported GAAP earnings of 82 cents per share, down a significant 32% from the $1.21 reported in 4Q19.  Full year earnings showed a worse picture, with a 57-cent net loss per share compared the $1.62 EPS profit in 2019.While 2020 showed losses for Dominion, the company did not attribute those losses to the corona crisis. Rather, the company noted several business factors that depressed earnings: charges due to planned retirement of electricity generation plants in Virginia; cancellation of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project; and lost operations due to the sale of the company’s Gas Transmission and Storage segment. These are all one-time charges, and in some respects offer the long-term benefit of streamlining business. Dominion guided 2021 full-year earnings to the range of $3.70 to $4.00 per share.Despite the mixed results of 2020, Dominion has seen some recent insider purchases that are pushing the insider sentiment needle into positive territory. President and CEO Robert Blue spent nearly $1 million on 14,442 shares of Dominion, while Board of Directors member Mark Kington made a smaller purchase of 2,000 shares, paying $138,578.Dominion has scored fans within the analyst community as well. Analyst Jeremy Tonet, from JPMorgan, covers Dominion Energy, and sees strength ahead for the company, in light of its ability to tack the political winds and shift to non-fossil fuel operations. “With 52% of Dominion growth allocated to zero-carbon investments, D’s leverage to ‘green rate of change’ leads most peer utilities and should drive a multiple re-rating over time. Importantly, the VA regulatory construct limits D’s offshore wind project risk relative to other industry participants given cost prudency presumption,” Tonet wrote.To this end, Tonet rates D an Overweight (i.e. Buy) and puts an $87 price target on the stock, implying an upside of 15% for the coming year. (To watch Tonet’s track record, click here)The 6 to 2 breakdown on recent stock reviews, in favor of Buy versus Hold, shows that Wall Street generally agrees with Tonet here, and makes the analyst consensus rating a Strong Buy. Shares in D are priced at $73.21, and their $81.50 average price target suggests an 11% upside from that level. (See Dominion stock analysis on TipRanks)Keurig Dr. Pepper (KDP)In these corona days, we should check in with a Doctor. Dr. Pepper, actually – a long-known brand in the food and beverage industry. The company owns over 55 brands of coffee, along with 20 flavored soda brands – including Dr. Pepper, 7Up, and A&W Root Beer – as well as an array of bottled waters, teas, juices, and mixers. Keurig Dr. Pepper is the 8th largest food and beverage company in the US, and saw more than $11 billion in total sales in 2020.While the company’s top-line revenues grew year-over-year in every quarter of 2020, earnings missed expectations in 4Q20 (EPS came in at 30 cents, against a 39-cent forecast). Yet, the company showed its confidence by increasing the regularly quarterly dividend by 25%, to 75 cents per share. At $3 per share annualized, this gives a yield of 2.27%. In early March, Board member – and corporate insider – Robert Singer made 4 informative purchases of KDP shares. Singer paid nearly $500,000 for a total of 9,500 shares. 5-star analyst Nik Modi appears to echo the Director’s sentiment. Providing key takeaways from the fourth-quarter, Modi noted: “Strong quarter for KDP with continued momentum in coffee and gains in packaged beverages. This quarter is another data point suggesting KDP is well positioned for 2021 and beyond. The dividend was also very positive news. We believe KDP has a very unique combination of strong underlying growth and significant balance sheet optionality.""Based on the above, Modi rates KDP an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $37 price target. This figure indicates a 10% upside potential from current levels. (To watch Modi’s track record, click here)Wall Street’s analyst corps are somewhat divided here, as shown by the Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 3 Buys and 2 Holds. KDP shares are priced at $33.56, and the $36.75 average price target implies a 9.5% upside for the year ahead. (See KDP stock analysis on TipRanks)Dentsply Sirona, Inc. (XRAY)We’ll conclude in the medical supply sector, where Dentsply is a major maker of dental equipment and dental health consumable. The company boasts annual revenues near $4 billion, based on equipment sales and educational services, and also has an active research program in the dental health field. Dentsply Sirona has global reach, with manufacturing facilities in 21 countries and marketing reach more than 120.The Q4 results showed $1.08 billion at the top line, compared to $1.11 billion in the prior year quarter, with EPS of 45 cents just 1-cent down from the year-ago quarter. Turning to the inside trades, Board member Gregory Lucier bought 5,000 shares of the stock on Mach 4, paying $294,750. Following the purchase, the Director now holds 23,142 shares, which are valued at $1.43 million.On the analyst front, Piper Sandler analyst Jason Bednar sums up the bull case for XRAY in his recent note on the stock: “[The] stock isn't getting enough credit for the visibility that management is providing... With a solid financial path to now follow and with management continuing to execute methodically towards its intermediate- to long-term financial targets, the ownership case for shares of XRAY remains attractive, in our opinion...""Taking all of this into consideration, Bednar stays with the bulls. The analyst rates XRAY an Overweight (i.e. Buy) along with a $70 price target, which implies ~12% upside from current levels. (To watch Bednar’s track record, click here)As for the rest of the Street, the bulls have it. XRAY's Moderate Buy consensus rating breaks down into 8 Buys, 4 Holds and 1 Sell received in the last three months. However, shares are selling for $62.06 and their recent appreciation has pushed them almost to the $63.67 average price target.

The company’s shares closed,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=24edb4fdbb51f33715f17545d743fc5ed981e4dd5b0f454cdee65ef84f163e4e

Dentsply (XRAY) expects the deal to be immediately accretive to its revenue growth rate and non-GAAP EPS in 2021. The acquisition is projected to generate non-GAAP EPS accretion of at least $0.05 in 2021 and be incrementally accretive in the years thereafter. The net present value of the tax benefits associated with the transaction is estimated to be about $160 million.The transaction, which closed on December 31, 2020, was funded with cash on Dentsply’s balance sheet.Byte has developed an online business model for the direct-to-consumer clear aligner market. The company’s doctor-directed system provides customers with access to at-home clear aligners kits for teeth. Headquartered in Los Angeles, Byte has over 450 employees and runs a nationwide network of licensed dentists and orthodontists that prescribe and oversee every customer’s treatment plan.Jorge Gomez, Dentsply’s CFO commented, “As we bring the two businesses together, we are confident that we can unlock incremental growth and further capitalize on the increasing consumer demand for clear aligner solutions. In addition, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to Dentsply Sirona’s long-term financial commitments as we continue to focus on driving growth and value for our shareholders.” Dentsply said that the acquisition comes amid expectations that the clear aligner market will increase at a 20%-25% growth rate in coming years. The company expects Byte to generate 2021 run-rate sales of at least $200 million. Combined with the SureSmile business, which has a projected revenue run-rate of $100 million by the end of 2021, Dentsply now forecasted the combined clear aligner revenue run-rate to triple to more than $300 million by the end of this year.Commenting on the deal announcement, Barrington Research analyst Michael Petusky, said that “in addition to the materially enhanced scale, this transaction allows the company to more fully participate in a marketplace that is likely growing faster than any other in dental.”  However, Petusky continued to maintain a Hold rating on the stock as although he likes the transaction and believes that it “holds the promise of helping the company to both accelerate its top line and drive margin expansion, we do not see the current valuation of XRAY as super-compelling given the near-term uncertainties associated with a still very challenging COVID-19 backdrop.” (See XRAY stock analysis on TipRanks)Overall, the rest of the Street is in line with Petusky’s outlook. The Hold analyst consensus is based on 5 Holds, 1 Sell and 3 Buys. The average price target stands at $55 and indicates 2.3% upside potential over the coming 12 months.Related News:Canadian Railway Announces Grain Shipping Record for 10th Successive MonthSVB Financial To Buy Boston Private For $900M; Shares Pop 24%Bank OZK Hikes Dividend; Street Is Cautiously Optimistic",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=66318d02c6f56ebf6da0bfb8d5f265d555b0dbf3f1865ad4b8af46697c7c8d6e
