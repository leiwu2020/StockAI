This acquisition further builds upon Boston Properties’ life sciences portfolio. The acquired properties are leased to a pharmaceutical company. Boston properties presently has 4.9 million square feet of lab space and Class A office properties in Massachusetts’ Waltham/Lexington area.



Bryan Koop, Executive Vice President, Boston Region, Boston Properties said, “Waltham continues to be a dominant urban edge location for life sciences organizations that want to attract and retain highly-educated talent.” (See Boston Properties stock analysis on TipRanks)



David Provost, Senior Vice President of Development, Co-Head of BXP Life Sciences, Boston Properties said, “The adjacency to our 200 West Street lab space and our medical space at 195 West street creates a significant opportunity for another BXP life sciences cluster in the Waltham market.”



Provost added, “This complements our existing life sciences presence in the Waltham market and allows us to meet ongoing demand from this important sector.”



On May 4, Argus Research analyst Angus Ferguson reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $120 from $100.



Ferguson thinks worries of permanently decreased demand for office space amid the COVID-19 pandemic are “overblown”.



Boston Properties has a development pipeline of $2.7 billion with a focus on coastal markets outside of New York. According to Ferguson, that offers the company a competitive advantage over its peers.



Consensus among analysts is that Boston Properties is a Hold based on 3 Buys, 8 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $109.58 implies 8.9% potential downside.



Shares have gained about 32.4% so far this year.

company,1621007470,7 Dividend Stocks to Avoid in Your Retirement Portfolio,67867800,,BXP,Yahoo,"Income stocks and retirement go hand in hand because they are both built for the long term. You don’t buy stocks for their dividends for the short term. They are steady investments that enhance your wealth the old-timey way, slowly over time. The challenge is to find stocks that can maintain and grow their dividends year after year. If their dividends are solid, their business is likely solid as well, and you’ll also see stock price growth, too. But there are stocks in special categories — limited partnerships (LPs), real estate investment trusts (REITs), business development corporations (BDCs) — that are structured in such a way that they cut the investor directly in on net profits and can offer tantalizing dividend yields.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 10 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks for Your Reliability Short List However, they can be cyclical, and those dividends may be here one day, gone the next. The seven dividend stocks to avoid in your retirement portfolio are unreliable stocks right now, so keep them out of your long-term plans. Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP) PPL Corp (NYSE:PPL) Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) AT&T (NYSE:T) VF Corp (NYSE:VFC) Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) Lamar Advertising (NASDAQ:LAMR) Retirement Stocks to Avoid: Boston Properties (BXP) Source: Shutterstock Real estate is hot, so why is this REIT on the list? Because it’s the wrong kind of real estate in the wrong places. Certainly, in this low-interest-rate environment, REITs as a whole have done well. But you don’t judge a stock on how well it does in the good times. It’s how it gets through the bad times that matters most for long-term investors looking toward retirement. BXP is the largest publicly traded commercial real estate developer in the U.S. It has nearly 200 buildings in Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York City and Washington, DC. These major cities were also experiencing an exodus of corporate workforces even before the pandemic. And now it’s worse. Add to that the kryptonite of REITs — rising interest rates — and BXP becomes a REIT that’s looking like shopping mall REITs did a few years ago. Given that, its 3.7% dividend may look tempting now, but the stock is already pulling back. The stock gets a D rating in my Portfolio Grader. PPL Corp (PPL) Source: Shutterstock With a 5.72% dividend and utility businesses in the U.K., as well as boomtown Louisville and central Pennsylvania, this would seem like a great stock for buy-and-hold investors looking toward retirement cash. But the U.K. business is up for sale, and rising rates aren’t good for utilities because it’s a cash-intensive business, keeping everything running, reliable and safe. That means rising rates aren’t going to help PPL. And if it sells its U.K. business, that’s going to affect cash flow, which may have a negative effect on its generous dividend. If it has to cut its dividend, that is usually like blood in the water with investors. This isn’t the time to be blinded by PPL’s risks just for the sake of its alluring dividend. 7 Great Growth Stocks to Consider for Your Short List The stock gets a D rating in my Portfolio Grader. Energy Transfer LP (ET) Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com As a limited partnership, ET treats its shareholders (technically unitholders) as owners and by law pays them out of net profits using a stock dividend. Given the comeback in oil stocks recently, it’s not surprising that ET’s current dividend is 6.11%. That’s certainly tempting, but there’s plenty of risk and volatility that comes along with that. ET is a leading midstream oil company, which means it makes its money in pipelines, moving oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids from fields to refineries and distribution centers. Do you remember Standing Rock? That was an ET-owned pipeline trying to get across the Sioux Nation. It’s still an issue. And then there’s the current ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline on the East Coast. The point is, there are risks here. It’s a big company, moving about 30% of the energy patch bounty around the nation. But LPs and their dividends aren’t something you can count on, and the industry is cyclical, which isn’t exactly what you want in a retirement stock. The stock gets a D rating in my Portfolio Grader. AT&T (T) Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com It seems odd to see the old Ma Bell on this list given its long reputation as a blue-chip company. However, T isn’t the company of old. As a matter of fact, you could make the argument that its legacy is precisely what has put it in the predicament it’s in today. It thought its primacy was going to continue when the mobile market exploded, given its powerful position in the telecom world. But more aggressive competitors started going after AT&T’s dissatisfied base, and today it’s losing ground. What’s more, when it bought TimeWarner Media it wasn’t prepared for entering the new digital content and streaming sector. It has been an expensive lesson. It’s crazy to think this company with a $230 billion market capitalization and 6.5% dividend is a risky choice for retirement money, but that’s where we are. 7 Stocks to Start your Robinhood Portfolio With Just $2,000 The stock gets a D rating in my Portfolio Grader. VF Corp (VFC) Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com On any given day, you likely see a brand or two that belongs to VF Corp. It has been making apparel since 1899, and today owns brands like Dickies, Supreme, The North Face, Jansport, Vans, Timberland and others. That seems like a pretty solid portfolio of brands covering work, outdoors and upscale leisurewear, and it is. But it’s also competing in a very competitive, low-margin market for the most part. And it’s at the will of consumer spending. Year to date, the stock is slightly underwater. And its 2.3% dividend is solid, for now. But any disruption with suppliers in China or a weakening dollar could hurt margins. There are plenty of other stocks without these risks, with better payouts. The stock gets a D rating in my Portfolio Grader. Equity Residential (EQR) Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com As its name implies, EQR is a residential REIT focused on apartment buildings in major cities around the country — Washington, DC; New York; Denver; Seattle; southern California — to name a few. The trouble is, the pandemic has moved the country online, and work-from-home solutions may well become part of the new work reality for some. Hybrid work schedules will make it less important to be working in a dense, loud, expensive city. That means current rents and building fees may take a hit to keep units full. And given current unemployment rates, there may be tenants that just don’t have the means to live downtown. The stock is up 25% year to date, and it has a 3.3% dividend. There are much better REITs out there at this point. 10 Ideal Dividend Stocks for Your Retirement The stock gets an F rating in my Portfolio Grader. Lamar Advertising (LAMR) Source: Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock.com Forget about digital advertising, LAMR has been in the advertising business since 1902. But its business is about 200 billboards around the U.S. and Canada, as well as about 325,000 logos, signs and transit displays. About seven years ago, it transitioned the company into a REIT. It’s certainly a unique business, and there are none of the risks that go along with many REITs trying to make money in a rising interest rate environment. But LAMR is expensive, trading at a current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 42. There’s just not enough growth in its model for that kind of valuation. Its current dividend is around 3%, but it’s hard to see how LAMR continues at this pace long term. The stock gets a D rating in my Portfolio Grader.

(BXP), which develops, owns, and manages Class A office properties in the US, has entered into a 10-year lease agreement with Roku Inc. The lease is for 72,000 square feet in Boston Properties’ 1.2 million square foot office campus in Santa Monica, California. Boston Properties’ Senior Vice President, Los Angeles Region, Jonathan Lange, said, “Roku’s commitment demonstrates the ongoing demand for premium, well-designed Class A office environments for today’s leading technology and entertainment companies.” Kevin Kearns, Director, Global Real Estate, Roku (ROKU), added, “We are very excited to begin our next chapter in Colorado Center. Our space will provide an ideal location for our team to connect, collaborate, and innovate, and we are thrilled to partner with Boston Properties to bring the space to life.” (See Boston Properties stock analysis on TipRanks) Boston Properties’ Colorado Center campus occupies 15 acres and is located in Santa Monica’s Media and Entertainment District. On April 19, Deutsche Bank analyst Derek Johnson reiterated a Hold rating on the stock and raised the price target to $107 from $103. Johnson believes the current norm of work from home and “hub and spoke” options will continue long-term and result in decreased demand for office space. Overall, consensus among analysts is that Boston Properties is a Hold, based on 1 Buy and 7 Holds. The average analyst price target of $107.13 implies the stock is fairly priced at current levels.
