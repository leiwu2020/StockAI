The streaming pioneer continues to charge ahead. Having gotten its start in the hardware end of the business, lately it’s been expanding its role in the content end as well.



In theory, this move should have investors excited. Yet, after already bidding up the stock at the end of 2020, much of what’s coming up has likely been factored into its share price. That’s clear from its current valuation. (See ROKU Stock Analysis on TipRanks)



Add in the fact that competition is heating up in the streaming arena, and it’s understandable why investors have taken such an “on the fence” view. For now, this mixed sentiment could continue.



The company may be making the right moves. Nevertheless, until investors start seeing tangible positive results from its further expansion, investors will remain hesitant to bid up shares much higher from today’s prices (around $347 per share).



ROKU Stock and Streaming Competition



Roku may have made a name for itself as a purveyor of streaming devices. On the other hand, in order to stay ahead of tech-based rivals like Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), it knows it has to offer up more than just streaming devices, and an ad network for third-parties.



That’s why Roku has been making a big push into streaming content as of late. This includes its purchase of failed streaming app Quibi’s content library, as well as its deal to stream new releases from independent studio Saban Films.



At a time where Amazon is cutting big checks to secure content (its $9 billion deal to buy MGM), and content giants are planning to merge, like the pending WarnerMedia/Discovery (DISCA) deal, will Roku’s efforts be enough?



Only time will tell. As its valuation remains sky-high, and investors take a “wait and see” approach, it may be difficult for shares in the near-term to move much higher from today’s prices.



Valuation Could Hold, But There’s Little Room for Expansion



It’s still uncertain whether Roku’s push into content will pay off. Yet, that’s not to say analysts aren’t projecting high levels of growth in the coming year. Set to grow its revenues by 54.1% this year, estimates call for the top line to grow another 36.8% in 2022. Earnings are also set to explode over the next year. Estimated to earn 37 cents a share this year, its bottom line is expected to rise by 127.5% next year, to $1.02 per share.



This high level of growth is why the stock has managed to achieve and maintain such a high valuation. At today’s prices, the stock sells for 12.2x estimated 2022 sales, and a staggering 338.7x 2022 earnings.



Given that its projected growth remains high, and there’s a possibility its streaming expansion could result in better-than-expected results, ROKU stock may not be at risk of pulling back further on multiple contraction.



On the other hand, could it see multiple expansion in the near future? Probably not. Already selling at a premium to not just its more diversified tech and entertainment industry rivals, but streaming pure plays like Netflix (NFLX) as well, it’s questionable whether this is in the cards.



What Analysts are Saying About ROKU Stock



According to TipRanks, ROKU stock has a consensus rating of Strong Buy. Out of 18 analyst ratings, 15 rate it a Buy, 2 analysts rate it a Hold, and 1 analyst rates it a Sell.



As for price targets, the average analyst Roku price target today is $449.94 per share, implying around 29.7% in upside from today’s prices. Analyst price targets range from a low of $300 per share, to a high of $560 per share.







Bottom Line: Expect Investors to Continue Taking a ‘Wait and See’ Approach



Even after its nearly 30% pullback from its February highs, Roku’s future growth is still largely factored into its stock price. In order to wow investors once again and kick off a rebound back to prior highs, it needs to not only meet, but beat, expectations.



Better-than-expected results could be ahead if its recent aggressive push into content pays off. Until that happens, expect investors to continue taking a “wait and see” approach with ROKU stock.

Still, as the content subscription service’s big media and big tech rivals bulk up, the streaming leader now faces additional challenges.



As is well-known, recent headline-making deals in streaming have included the proposed merger of AT&T’s (T) WarnerMedia unit into Discovery Inc. (DISCA), as well as Amazon’s (AMZN) recently-announced purchase of film studio MGM.



This development adds to the ground big media has gained when it comes to its own streaming services. ViacomCBS’s (VIAC) Paramount+, as well of WarnerMedia’s HBOMax are some recent examples. Put them together, and they may start to have a dramatic effect on Netflix’s growth potential, both in the U.S. and in its overseas markets. (See Netflix stock analysis on TipRanks)



So, what could this do to stock price performance going forward? Even with these headwinds, international growth may still be on the table. This could help shares, trading for around $492 per share today, to hold steady. Yet, if this “grow into its valuation” catalyst fails to fully play out, the above-mentioned pressures could weigh down further on shares.



NFLX Stock and The Impact of Big Media Consolidation



How will the recent media deals affect Netflix shares going forward? Sure, as some have pointed out, the Amazon-MGM tie up may do little to affect the streaming space. Even after the still-pending WarnerMedia-Discovery merger closes, this platform will remain at the top of the streaming heap.



For now, Netflix’s ubiquitous service remains the leader by subscriptions worldwide (204 million). With Amazon’s Prime Video (150 million) the second largest, big media’s various streaming platforms are still far behind, with Disney’s (DIS) Disney+ the only one coming close to hitting 100 million.



Nonetheless, even as it remains the streaming leader, this doesn’t guarantee it will not impact its underlying growth, as well as the future growth of the NFLX stock price, going forward. As the company’s pandemic tailwinds (which helped materially boost results in 2020) fade, the platform’s growth both in the U.S. and overseas is slowing down.



Based on sell-side projections of 2022, growth may still be at a level that allows Netflix to hold onto its current valuation. However, if the recent deal-making and rival streaming services launches result in its actual results falling short, this richly-priced stock could be at risk of pulling back.



Slowing Growth May Mean Valuation Contraction



Right now, even with the potential risks mentioned above, high growth remains on the menu for NFLX stock going into 2022. Sell-side estimates call for the company’s revenue to grow around 15%, and its earnings to grow around 23.2%, next year.



If it lives up to these estimates, it may be sufficient to help the stock, today trading for a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 37.9x, hold steady at its present price levels. Yet, both estimates are far from being set in stone.



Why? Namely, with the pandemic wrapping up, Netflix’s subscriber growth is again falling short of expectations. Fortunately, even with the rising competition, the company’s annual content budget has yet to soar to a point where it threatens earnings growth, if revenue growth comes in less than expected.



With its content costs this year ($17 billion) the same as last year, earnings growth will still be outsized, even if the top grows at a much slower slip. Even so, if earnings fall short of 20%+ growth, it may be enough to contract Netflix’s valuation. Perhaps that will be only a modest correction, but a move down to a forward P/E of 30x would still result in a double-digit decline from today’s prices.



What Analysts are Saying About NFLX Stock



According to TipRanks, NFLX stock has a consensus rating of Moderate Buy. Out of 36 analyst ratings, 26 rate it a Buy, 6 analysts rate it a Hold, and 4 analysts rate it a Sell.



As for price targets, the NFLX average analyst price target today is $599.33 per share, implying around 21.7% in upside from today’s prices. Analyst price targets range from a low of $340 per share, to a high of $720 per share.







Bottom Line: Increased Competition Leaves Netflix Shares at Risk of Going Nowhere, or Lower, From Here



Netflix may remain the leader of the streaming space, but its days of delivering above-average growth may be numbered. As its worldwide subscriber growth slows, top and bottom-line results going forward could fall short of the expectations currently priced into shares.



That’s not to say that NFLX stock is at risk of big declines. Yet, as more investors fear that upside is limited, shares may have a tough time getting back to their highs set earlier this year ($593.29 per share).

This Analyst Says ‘Yes’,67884401,https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?1865193318,DISCA,Nasdaq,"By now you've heard the news: AT&T (T) is planning to split off and merge its WarnerMedia business, home to HBO Max (of Game of Thrones fame), with Discovery, Inc. (DISCA) and its discovery+ media properties.In the companies' announcement released Monday morning, AT&T and Discovery said the combination will ""form one of the largest global streaming players,"" combining ""WarnerMedia's premium entertainment, sports and news assets with Discovery's leading nonfiction and international entertainment and sports businesses to create a premier, standalone global entertainment company.""From AT&T's perspective, the deal will essentially split AT&T into two companies. Rump AT&T will receive $43 billion ""in a combination of cash, debt securities, and WarnerMedia's retention of certain debt"" to help it become ""one of the best capitalized 5G and fiber broadband companies in the United States."" Meanwhile, AT&T's media properties (HBO, etc.) will spin off to join with Discovery to become a ""'pure play' content company [with] one of the deepest libraries in the world.""This ""pure play"" company, yet to be named say the parties, will come into existence when the deal closes in mid-2022. Shortly thereafter, the parties anticipate the media company to boast $52 billion in annual revenue, ""adjusted EBITDA of approximately $14 billion, and an industry leading Free Cash Flow conversion rate of approximately 60%"" (which appears to imply annual free cash flow on the order of $31.2 billion) once it has achieved its target of ""at least $3 billion in expected cost synergies annually.""Unsurprisingly, it's the new-born media conglomerate that investors are fixating on today, with Barrington analyst James Goss, for example, lauding its ""vast assets in scripted plus unscripted"" television content, and its $20 billion in annual spending on new content.The combined company, says Goss, will include ""the top television studio in terms of output,"" ""the #2 film studio,"" and ""a suite of content spanning sports, news, family, scripted and unscripted content,"" boasting significant U.S. market share and also ""a substantial international presence"" that can ""reach consumers in over 200 countries globally."" This would all make for, says Goss in a significant understatement, ""a highly attractive streaming product.""Accordingly, even though current Discovery shareholders will control only 29% of the shares of the combined media company, Goss is reiterating his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on Discovery shares, and his $50 price target on those shares. (To watch Goss' track record, click here)Speaking of those shares, Goss points out that one advantage of the merger will be significant simplification of Discovery stock, as ""the three-class Discovery common share structure [is] collapsed into one."" This one class of Discovery stock, by the way, is on track to earn only $2.95 per share this year (down 8% from 2020, when most of the world's population as stuck at home watching TV). By 2022, however, the year of the merger, Goss anticipates that Discovery will be back on a growth path with or without HBO, et al, earning $3.50 per share and thus growing its profits nearly 19% year over year.In terms of DISCA's Street consensus, analysts are split almost right down the middle. Out of 15 total analyst ratings published in the last three months, 7 say Buy while 8 suggest Hold, making the consensus a Moderate Buy. In addition, the average price target of $47.71 amounts to ~39% upside potential.

The transaction will generate $43 billion for AT&T in cash and debt.AT&T shareholders will own 71% of the combined company, while Discovery shareholders will receive a 29% stake in the new company.“AT&T shareholders will retain their stake in our leading communications company that comes with an attractive dividend. Plus, they will get a stake in the new company, a global media leader that can build one of the top streaming platforms in the world,” said AT&T CEO John Stankey.AT&T and Discovery expect the merger to create a global leader in streaming services while simultaneously cutting costs and increasing revenue. They estimate an annual cost savings of $3 billion. Additionally, the combined media company is projected to generate $52 billion in revenue in 2023 and deliver $14 billion in adjusted EBITDA.  The increased cash flow will fund further investments in its content and digital realms, as well as the company's direct-to-consumer advertising activities. If all goes as planned, the transaction will close in mid-2022, and Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav will lead the combined company.AT&T anticipates that the WarnerMedia spinoff will boost its capital structure and allow it to invest more in its telecom business. (See AT&T stock analysis on TipRanks)Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan reiterated a Hold rating on AT&T stock without assigning it a price target.“T has been restructuring itself to lower costs and reinvest in high growth areas such as 5G wireless (C-Band), HBO Max, and broadband,” noted Horan.Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Hold based on 5 Buy, 7 Hold, and 2 Sell ratings. The average analyst price target of $30.70 implies 2.14% downside potential to current levels.AT&T scores a 7 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, implying the stock’s returns are likely to align with market performance.Related News:Constellation Eyes Diverse Drinkers with La Fête du Rosé InvestmentRalph Lauren Sells Club Monaco Unit to Regent, Focus on Core BrandsAlphabet’s Google Inks Cloud Deals with SpaceX and PayPal",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e03edcef30d11b2c51575829105aa9d5700c2da570c436e9456474c185f2ed36
