Carver Bancorp (CARV) was one of the biggest gainers in the pre-market, bouncing 25.45% at the time of writing.

On Thursday, the stock was up by as much as 267% before finishing 107% higher for the day.



Nova Lifestyle Inc. (NVFY) was the biggest loser at the time of writing falling 20.26%. It is still unclear what is causing the stock to tank. The company, through its subsidiaries, designs, manufactures, and sells residential and commercial furniture to middle and upper-middle-income consumers.

Post the buyout, Socio Labs will become a part of Cisco’s Webex cohort. The addition is expected to be beneficial to Cisco in terms of customizable and inclusive offerings. Notably, access to actionable data insights on customers can aid Cisco to further enhance offerings in the future.

The acquisition is expected to enhance the tech giant's push to accelerate clients' transition to hybrid cloud and AI.



Turbonomic is also expected to complement Instana, IBM's recent acquisition. The two are key to the tech giant's push to launch IBM Cloud for Watson AIOps and support the automation of IT operations using AI.



Increased investments in AI-powered automation are part of IBM's focus that seeks to help businesses succeed in the digital world. (See IBM stock chart on TipRanks).



""IBM is already helping thousands of customers use automation to make IT and business processes more efficient and employees more effective. Now that Turbonomic is a part of our portfolio, IBM is the only company providing a one-stop shop of AI-powered automation capabilities, all built on Red Hat OpenShift to run anywhere,"" said IBM Automation GM, Dinesh Nirmal



IBM will leverage Turbonomic's Network Performance Management (NPM) products and operations in the telecom industry to supplement its offerings around 5G adoption. The company intends to help customers optimize applications running on 5G environments.



Turbonomic stands to reach and serve a more robust customer base by being acquired by IBM. Additionally, it should enable the hosting of applications and operations across cloud environments. The company will also continue to build and grow the OEM relationship with Cisco (CSCO).



BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan has reiterated a Buy rating on IBM with a $175 price target, implying 20.2% upside potential to current levels. The analyst expects the company to post earnings per share of $1.07 for Q2 2021.



Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 4 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The IBM average analyst price target of $151.75 implies 4.2% upside potential to current levels.

Webex supports video meetings, calling, and messaging through a single app. 



The COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating the adoption of a hybrid workforce model wherein companies allow their employees to work from the office or home, or while on the move. As part of this shift, companies are turning to integrated cloud collaboration solutions, and Cisco is positioning itself to meet that demand with Webex.



Through the arrangement, AT&T and Cisco will combine their products to improve the performance and reliability of Webex calling for enterprise users. Cisco's Unified Communications Manager Cloud (UCMC) will bring cutting-edge technology to Webex. 



AT&T is one of the leading telecom providers in the U.S., serving both consumers and businesses. Nearly 2,000 of the biggest multinational companies are its customers. (See AT&T stock analysis on TipRanks)



""Our Webex solutions transformed the cloud calling experience and combine enterprise-calling features with market-leading virtual meetings and collaboration technology,” commented Javed Khan, Cisco Collaboration general manager.



Cisco primarily sells networking gear and offers accompanying software and services. It has partnered with AT&T to offer voice services since 1997. The latest arrangement to sell Webex to enterprise customers extends that relationship. (See Cisco stock analysis on TipRanks)



Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall reiterated a Buy rating with a price target of $57 on Cisco stock. Marshall’s price target implies 5.42% upside potential. The analyst cited improving demand for Cisco products as justification for maintaining his bullish view on the stock.



""We believe earnings power is underappreciated ahead of expected resumptions in enterprise office project activity and inorganic growth contributions from Acacia. Our checks post April leave us further encouraged following our initial checks post March,” noted Marshall.



Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 12 Buys and 7 Holds. The average analyst Cisco price target of $56.31 implies 4.14% upside potential to current levels.



CSCO scores a 9 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.
