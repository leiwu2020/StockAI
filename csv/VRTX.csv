Piper Sandler analyst Edward Tenthoff recently maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $261 (36% upside potential).



In a research note to investors, Tenthoff said that Vertex’s share repurchase program immediately follows the discontinuation of VX-864 AATD and the company is “investing to find future legs of growth.”



Overall, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 19 Buys and 5 Holds. The average Vertex Pharmaceuticals analyst price target of $261.68 implies 36.3% upside potential from current levels. The company’s shares have lost 35% over the past year.



According to TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, Vertex scores a “Perfect 10”, suggesting that the stock is likely to outperform market averages.

In its June 10 update to investors, the company announced that it will not be moving the drug to late-stage development. (See VRTX stock analysis on TipRanks) 



Five-star analyst Hartaj Singh of Oppenheimer & Co. covered the stock in his report, optimistically stating that the failure of VX-864 “speaks to the often non-linearity of preclinical and clinical development,” that is, if Vertex can derive uses from the results. Singh maintained a Buy rating and declared a price target of $305. This would indicate a potential upside of $61.40 from the stock’s Tuesday closing price.  



Following the after-market hours announcement, Vertex’s share price fell more than a combined 12% in the three trading days thereafter. The stock is down over 30% over the last year, due in large part to a safety concern over a drug called VX-814. Despite this, Singh wrote that the company has more promising upcoming projects and is worthy of a Buy rating.  



Signh is confident that Vertex can achieve its AATD objectives. The VX-814 safety issues were mitigated, and he believes the company can turn around its unfavorable results from VX-864. He says that VRTX has over 10 years of experience researching AATD, and this fact encourages him.  



Furthermore, Vertex has seen consistent sales and earnings growth from its Cystic Fibrosis treatment, Kalydeco, and Signh expects the stock to continue to rate positively with analysts, and for investors to seize the moment as a buying opportunity.  



On TipRanks, VRTX has an analyst rating consensus of Strong Buy, based on 19 Buy and 5 Hold ratings. The average analyst VRTX price target is $261.68, reflecting a potential 12-month upside of 38.48%.

In the first quarter, the company posted net product revenues of $1.7 billion, up 14% year-over-year with a non-GAAP diluted net income of $2.98 per share, an increase of 16% year-over-year.



Last week, Vertex gave two key updates regarding VX-864 and the CTX001 program.



VX-864



Last week, Vertex said that the company’s drug, VX-864, intended to treat a rare, genetic disease, Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD), was well-tolerated in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study.



The company stated in its press release, “These data provide clear evidence that an oral small molecule corrector designed to promote the proper folding of the mutant Z-AAT protein can increase plasma levels of fAAT [alpha-1 antitrypsin] in patients with AATD. Although results provide proof-of-mechanism, the magnitude of treatment effect observed in this study is unlikely to translate into substantial clinical benefit.”



As a result, VRTX will not advance the drug VX-864 into late-stage development. However, the company will “advance additional novel small molecule correctors with the potential for increased clinical efficacy into the clinic.” (See Vertex Pharmaceuticals stock analysis on TipRanks)



Following this development, Oppenheimer analyst Hartaj Singh reiterated a Buy with a price target of $305 (61.4% upside) on the stock. Singh said in a note to investors, “The key question to consider with future VX-864 development is whether the company can get potent molecules into the liver in high concentrations. Since the company was able to mitigate the molecule-specific safety issue seen with VX-814 (10/20) with VX-864, we are optimistic the company can achieve its AATD objectives.”



CTX001 Program



CTX001 is an investigational gene-editing therapy program developed along with CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) that is being assessed for patients suffering from transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) and severe sickle cell disease (SCD).



Last week, the company announced new data regarding 22 patients with more than three months follow-up treatment, ranging in age from 4 months to 26 months, who were treated with CTX001. The results indicated a sustained and consistent response to treatment.



CTX001 is being evaluated in two Phase 1 clinical trials currently. In total, around 40 patients have received doses across both studies so far.



Analyst Singh commented, “If we strip out the pipeline (CTX-001 in our model), we get a CF franchise value of $180 to $220/share. We believe that CTX-001 and other pipeline projects are worthy of a premium multiple and stay bullish.”



Following these two key updates, shares of VRTX have tanked 10.5% in the past five days. However, Singh expects that with more clinical and regulatory updates for the company’s other drugs in the pipeline, “VRTX has non-trivial catalysts upcoming.”



The analyst added, “Combined with as yet consistently unmatched sales/earnings trajectory from CF, we expect the stock to re-rate positively in 2021. We expect savvy investors to be buyers on extended weakness.”



Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 19 Buys and 5 Holds. The average analyst VRTX price target of $261.68 implies approximately 38.5% upside potential to current levels.

That’s a basic precept of any economic trading system. The trick, however, is recognizing when the stock is low enough to buy in. The prime moment to buy is when the stock hits bottom; that will maximize returns when the share price starts to rise again.



Wall Street’s analyst corps know this, and they are not shying away from recommending stocks that may have hit bottom. Using TipRanks database, we pinpointed two such stocks. Each is down significantly, but each also has enough upside potential to warrant a Buy rating.



Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX)



We’ll start with Vertex Pharmaceuticals, a biotech firm that got its start back in 1989, researching treatments for cystic fibrosis. The company now has four approved drugs on the market for the treatment of CF, and is expected to dominate this particular segment for the next two decades. Nevertheless, the stock has been falling this year, and is down 20% year-to-date.



The most recent sell-off came this past Friday, June 11, and coincided with the company's decision to end its clinical trial program for VX-864, a drug candidate under investigation as a treatment for alpha-1 antitrypsin (AATD). The decision was made after the drug failed to show clear clinical benefits in its Phase 2 trial. 



Biotech research programs fail frequently – it is a baked-in risk of the business. Of greater concern to investors than this individual program is the larger fact that over the years Vertex has yet to develop a successful drug program outside of its line of CF treatments. Concern that the company may be a one-trick pony underlay the recent sell-off.



Within the CF program, however, Vertex has had considerable success. The company’s four approved drugs (trade names Trikafta, Symdeko, Orkambi, and Kalydeco) are proven money-makers in an established market, and the company has seen revenues increase sequentially in the last 6 quarters. The most recent quarter, 1Q21, showed $1.72 billion at the top line, up 14% year-over-year. GAAP EPS, at $2.49, was up 8.7% yoy.



Writing on Vertex in the wake of the VX-864 discontinuation, Cowen analyst Phil Nadeau acknowledges the failure of the program – but also the company’s fundamental strength.



“While '864's demise is disappointing, in some ways it is a 'good failure' that advances the program and partially de-risks safety and the mechanism. Vertex has a track record of iterating in its pipeline, producing increasingly better candidates. We are optimistic that Vertex will eventually produce a successful AAT corrector that increases fAAT levels above the protective threshold, with benign safety... We think Vertex is positioned for L-T outperformance as CF franchise revenue grows at a 9% CAGR and pipeline candidates advance,” Nadeau opined.



Nadeau sees Vertex in the process of ‘failing up,’ and rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy). His $300 price target implies an upside of 59% on the one-year time frame. (To watch Nadeau’s track record, click here)



A look at the analyst consensus shows that Nadeau is hardly an outlier on this stock. Of the 24 recent reviews, 19 are to Buy and only 5 are to Hold, making the consensus view a Strong Buy. The shares are priced at $188.97 and the $261.68 average price target suggests a 38% one-year upside. (See VRTX stock analysis on TipRanks)







OneConnect Financial Technology (OCFT)



Now let’s change gears, and move from biotech to software tech. OneConnect is a fintech, operating in China’s digital banking sector. This puts the company solidly in the middle of a huge potential growth market; digital banking was expanding before corona, but the pandemic year saw online banking services expand. The digital banking market is estimated at $8 trillion globally – and China, with the world’s largest population and second largest economy, is positioned to make outsize gains in the area. This is the environment in which OneConnect lives.



The company offers technology-as-a-service, putting a range of digital banking tools and applications on one platform. This makes OneConnect a one-stop-shop for digital banking providers, and the company serves almost all of China’s major and city banks, and more than half of the country’s insurance companies.



OneConnect has, like many expanding tech companies, been running consistent net losses. The company has yet to turn a profit – although the 1Q21 EPS loss of 13 cents was an improvement over the year-ago loss of 17 cents per share. At the top line, Q1 revenues came in at $126.5 million (820 million Chinese yuan), up 52% year-over-year.



Even with that, however, the stock dropped sharply this year, losing 39% of its value. Yet, at least one analyst sees the current low share price as a chance to buy in. 



HSBC analyst Carson Lo gives OCFT a Buy rating, and sets a $20 price target that indicates room for ~66% upside in the year ahead. (To watch Lo’s track record, click here)



“The recovery in the business activities has driven revenue from third-party customers, helping to maintain the accelerating yoy growth trajectory, and we expect this trend to remain in the coming quarters, on: 1) delivery of sizable contracts secured in 1Q... and 2) easy comparables ahead in 2H21 as the company has ramped up its product-optimisation efforts, i.e. exiting the low-margin legacy products (mainly in the business origination segment), since mid-2020,” Lo wrote.



Overall, while there are only two recent reviews on file for OneConnect, both agree that this stock is one to buy, making the Moderate Buy consensus unanimous. The share price, of $12.07, and the average price target of $22, together suggest a one-year upside potential of 82%. (See OCFT stock analysis on TipRanks)

Indeed, this stock has been better than a 5-bagger for investors who have held CRSP stock for the past five years. For those with a long-term view on this stock, perhaps similar results are in store for the next five years.



Gene editing plays are among the hottest in the biotech world today. The company’s market capitalization of nearly $10 billion speaks to the degree of confidence investors have in CRISPR’s ability to generate growing cash flows over time.



Some investors may be concerned with the valuation this stock has generated. The company hasn’t really produced any sort of meaningful revenue or cash flows thus far. Thankfully for growth investors, stocks are valued on the basis of their earnings potential, rather than backwards-looking data. (See CRISPR Therapeutics stock analysis on TipRanks)



What Does CRSPR Do?



CRISPR’s name stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat. In layman’s terms, the company’s a gene editing play, built upon the advancements made with the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tool.



It is important to note that CRSP isn’t the only player utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tool. The company’s competitors include Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA) and Editas Medicine (EDIT). These competitors and others are utilizing gene therapy solutions in their business models.



Competition isn’t great for any company in any sector. However, the gene editing space is one with high growth potential and perhaps enough room for everyone.



The global gene editing market was valued at $3.7 billion in 2020, but is expected to grow at a 23% CAGR for the next seven years. For long-term investors, that’s a very nice rate of return. If CRISPR can snag a meaningful piece of this growing pie, long-term investors will do very well.



Of course, bringing a drug to market is only the first step. Here’s what’s cooking with CRISPR in this regard.



Potential Value of CRISPR Stock Lies in Drug Pipeline



CRISPR’s potential as a transformative technological breakthrough is well-known. Long-term investors have jumped on CRSP stock for this reason alone. Additionally, the company’s prospective drug pipeline is intriguing.



CRISPR’s lead candidate is CTX001, a drug focused on treating Sickle Cell disease and Beta Thalassemia. This drug has been touted as the blockbuster drug which has the potential to take CRSP stock on a nice ride. However, it is not yet commercialized.



CRISPR is hoping to commercialize its CTX001 drug via a collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX). This collaboration has been updated recently, to provide CRSPR with a cash infusion and give Vertex greater upside potential from commercialization.



Given the cash needs of CRISPR in further developing its technology and building out its drug pipeline, this deal likely makes sense. As a result of the deal, CRISPR receives $900 million in cash up front, with $200 million in milestone payments, should CTX001 be approved by the FDA or European regulators. In exchange, Vertex will receive 60% of the future revenues generated from this drug.



The potential of this drug is truly impressive. This is the drug investors have their eye on right now, as most of CRISPR’s other potential candidates are likely years away from potential approval. Accordingly, the impact of a prospective approval could take this stock soaring.



On the other hand, should an approval either fail to materialize or take substantially longer than investors are pricing in, there is the potential for downside volatility with CRSP stock. This remains in many ways a speculative play on the future of gene editing technology.



What Analysts Are Saying About CRSP Stock



According to TipRanks’ analyst rating consensus, CRSP stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 10 analyst ratings, there are 7 Buy recommendations, 1 Hold recommendation, and 2 Sell recommendations.



As for price targets, the average analyst CRISPR price target is $160.75. Analyst price targets range from a low of $117.00 per share to a high of $189.00 per share.







Bottom Line



CRSP stock is difficult to value right now. This company is still essentially pre-revenue, and holds a massive valuation.



That being said, the company’s technology does look very promising. It’s easy to see why CRSP stock has garnered the valuation it has, and if the company does get approval for its CTX001 drug, all bets are off as to how high this stock could fly.



For aggressive investors, this stock certainly looks like an intriguing pick. For more conservative investors, staying on the sidelines may be the best course of action.

The abstract posted online today includes data on patients with severe sickle cell disease with more than 3 months of follow-up, as of the interim data cut on January 28, 2021. Data will be updated and information on additional patients will be included for the congress. Abstract #EP733 entitled “CTX001 for Transfusion-Dependent Β-Thalassemia: Safety and Efficacy Results from the Ongoing CLIMB Thal-111 Study of Autologous Crispr-Cas9-Modified CD34+ Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells,” will be made available on the virtual platform as an e-poster Friday, June 11 at 9:00 CEST. The abstract posted online today includes data on patients with transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT) with more than 3 months of follow-up, including patients with the most severe genotypes, as of the interim data cut on January 21, 2021. Data will be updated and information on additional patients will be included for the congress. The accepted abstracts are now available online on the EHA website https://library.ehaweb.org/eha/#!*menu=6*browseby=8*sortby=2*media=3*ce_id=2035*label=21989*ot_id=25562*marker=1286. CTX001 is being investigated in two ongoing clinical trials as a potential one-time curative therapy for patients suffering from TDT and severe SCD. About CTX001CTX001 is an investigational, autologous, ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy that is being evaluated for patients suffering from TDT or severe SCD, in which a patient’s hematopoietic stem cells are edited to produce high levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF; hemoglobin F) in red blood cells. HbF is a form of the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin that is naturally present at birth, which then switches to the adult form of hemoglobin. The elevation of HbF by CTX001 has the potential to alleviate transfusion requirements for patients with TDT and reduce painful and debilitating sickle crises for patients with SCD. Earlier results from these ongoing trials were published as a Brief Report in The New England Journal of Medicine in January of 2021. Based on progress in this program to date, CTX001 has been granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT), Fast Track, Orphan Drug, and Rare Pediatric Disease designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for both TDT and SCD. CTX001 has also been granted Orphan Drug Designation from the European Commission, as well as Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), for both TDT and SCD. Among gene-editing approaches being investigated/evaluated for TDT and SCD, CTX001 is the furthest advanced in clinical development. About CLIMB-111The ongoing Phase 1/2 open-label trial, CLIMB-Thal-111, is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of CTX001 in patients ages 12 to 35 with TDT. The trial will enroll up to 45 patients and follow patients for approximately two years after infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in a long-term follow-up trial. About CLIMB-121The ongoing Phase 1/2 open-label trial, CLIMB-SCD-121, is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of CTX001 in patients ages 12 to 35 with severe SCD. The trial will enroll up to 45 patients and follow patients for approximately two years after infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in a long-term follow-up trial. About CLIMB-131This is a long-term, open-label trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CTX001 in patients who received CTX001 in CLIMB-111 or CLIMB-121. The trial is designed to follow participants for up to 15 years after CTX001 infusion. About the Gene-Editing Process in These TrialsPatients who enroll in these trials will have their own hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells collected from peripheral blood. The patient’s cells will be edited using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The edited cells, CTX001, will then be infused back into the patient as part of a stem cell transplant, a process which involves, among other things, a patient being treated with myeloablative busulfan conditioning. Patients undergoing stem cell transplants may also encounter side effects (ranging from mild to severe) that are unrelated to the administration of CTX001. Patients will initially be monitored to determine when the edited cells begin to produce mature blood cells, a process known as engraftment. After engraftment, patients will continue to be monitored to track the impact of CTX001 on multiple measures of disease and for safety. About the Vertex-CRISPR CollaborationVertex and CRISPR Therapeutics entered into a strategic research collaboration in 2015 focused on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to discover and develop potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human disease. CTX001 represents the first potential treatment to emerge from the joint research program. Under a recently amended collaboration agreement, Vertex will lead global development, manufacturing and commercialization of CTX001 and split program costs and profits worldwide 60/40 with CRISPR Therapeutics. This amendment is subject to customary closing conditions and clearances, including clearance under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.
