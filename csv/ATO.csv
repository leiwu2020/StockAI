It was also announced that shareholders of Atmos Energy's stock as of February 22, 2021 are entitled to the dividend. The stock is expected to become ex-dividend 1 business day(s) before the record date. The ex-dividend date for Atmos Energy will be on February 19, 2021. The company's current dividend payout is at $0.62. That equates to a dividend yield of 2.82% at current price levels. Understanding Ex-Dividend Dates' Ex-dividend dates signal when company shares cease to trade with their current dividend payouts. There is a small intermission period before companies announce new dividends. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Typically, companies will announce and implement new dividend yields on a quarterly basis. Understanding Atmos Energy's Dividend Payouts And Yields Over the past year, Atmos Energy has experienced an overall upward trend regarding its dividend payouts and yields. Last year on February 21, 2020 the company's payout was $0.57, which has since grown by $0.05. Similarly, Atmos Energy's dividend yield in last year was 1.94%, which has since grown by 0.88%. Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market. To read more about Atmos Energy click here.

National Transportation Safety Board officials said that after those first two incidents, Atmos Energy should have isolated the natural gas line and evacuated residents. “The disaster could have been prevented if Atmos Energy had done what they needed to do,"" NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said following a board meeting. NTSB officials said Atmos didn’t adequately investigate the first two fires. Linda “Michellita” Rogers was killed and four others were injured in the Feb. 23, 2018, explosion in a neighborhood near Dallas Love Field. NTSB officials said that gas had leaked from a steel line running down an alley that had degraded after being dented, likely by heavy equipment during the replacement of a sewer line more than 20 years earlier. Officials said the gas migrated through the soil and into the house, where it was ignited by an unknown source. Sumwalt said that in the weeks after the explosion, Atmos found about 1,260 leaks in area lines. “All together it is endemic of an organization that is not properly managing its pipeline system,” Sumwalt said. Atmos said in a statement Tuesday that their “number one priority is the safety of the public, our employees, and our natural gas distribution system,” and that they are “resolved to learn from this tragic accident.” Atmos said they are reviewing the NTSB's complete findings and recommendations from the explosion, and say that “but for the unreported damage, the pipe would not have failed.” In 2019, Atmos settled a wrongful death...",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=63de83ed065153b52427a4c187bb2b5e488d364e330e715a20eae4b94d0363f5
