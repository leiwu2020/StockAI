Following the news, shares of Accenture rose 0.9% at the close of Tuesday’s trading session.



The acquisition is in line with Accenture’s focus on expanding its workforce management capabilities. The 300-strong team of Workforce Insights will be integrated into Accenture’s Intelligent Platform Services arm, adding value to its advisory and planning services, and expanding its data analytics technology solutions. The deal will also help Accenture reach Workforce Insights’ wide range of customers across the healthcare, manufacturing, retail and public sector industries.



The announcement comes on close heels of Accenture’s definitive agreement to acquire Wabion, a Google Cloud services provider, which was announced last week. (See Accenture stock chart on TipRanks)



Emma McGuigan, global lead of Intelligent Platform Services, Accenture, said, “With an increased focus on business resilience and agility to compete and thrive during these extraordinary times, companies need a holistic, connected approach to workforce and human capital management to achieve and sustain operational excellence.”



She further justified the acquisition, saying, “Workforce Insight’s dedicated team of professionals...ideally complement Accenture’s capabilities and better position us to drive value for our clients.”



Following strong performance results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 last month, Argus Research analyst Jim Kelleher reiterated a Buy rating on the stock, while raising the price target to $330 from $300. The analyst’s price target implies an upside potential of 5.8% from current levels.



Kelleher attributed the upside to the company's revenues and earnings beat, double-digit year-over-year growth on both metrices, and raised guidance for the full fiscal year of 2021. The analyst also believes that Accenture’s financial strength, wide customer base, and market strength are key driving forces for business growth as digital transformation ramps up across industries to suit a hybrid post-pandemic world. 



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 14 Buys and 4 Holds. The average Accenture price target of $323.06 implies upside potential of 3.5% from current levels.

The company reported earnings of $2.40 per share, higher than the $2.23 per share estimated by analysts. Also, it marks a 26% improvement from $2.44 recorded in the same quarter last year.



Quarterly revenues came in at $13.3 billion, which surpassed analysts’ estimates of $12.5 billion, up 21% from the year-ago period.



Notably, new bookings witnessed 39% growth from the last year’s quarter to $15.4 billion, along with consulting bookings of $8 billion (up 30%) and outsourcing bookings of $7.4 billion (52%). (See Accenture stock chart on TipRanks)



CEO of Accenture, Julie Sweet, said, “Our outstanding financial results reflect our continued momentum driven by the demand for digital transformation, the depth and breadth of our client relationships with the world’s leading companies, our talented people and the strength of our business across geographic markets, industries and services.”



On assumptions of another 0.5% favorable impact of foreign exchange on results, the company expects fiscal 2021 revenue growth to be in the range of 10% to 11% in local currency, compared with 6.5% to 8.5% previously guided.



GAAP EPS is anticipated to be in the range of $9.07 to $9.16, compared with $8.67 to $8.85 previously.



On June 21, Jefferies analyst Surinder Thind initiated a Hold rating on the stock with a price target of $309 (5.4% upside potential).



Thind noted, “Given the company's scale and strong competitive positioning, ACN warrants consideration as a core holding. However, for potential new investors, there may be better opportunity elsewhere within the IT Consulting group to earn higher returns in the year ahead.”



“Revenue and earnings have the potential to grow at a high single digit pace the next few years amidst favorable secular trends,” he added.



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 7 Buys and 2 Hold. The average Accenture analyst price target of $311.78 implies upside potential of 7% from current levels. Shares of the company have gained 41.6% over the past year.



TipRanks’ Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool shows that confidence in Accenture is currently Positive, as the cumulative change in holdings across all 13 hedge funds that were active in the last quarter was an increase of 13,100 shares.

The financial details of the agreement remained undisclosed.



Exton provides strategy and business management support to financial services firms in Europe. The acquisition bolsters Accenture’s expertise in enabling clients to accelerate and scale their transformation projects in the financial domain, while also providing them end-to-end solutions across strategy, design, technology, and operations.



Accenture's Market Unit Lead for France and Benelux, Olivier Girard, said, “Our intent to acquire Exton Consulting is part of our overall growth strategy to expand critical skills and capabilities in strategic, high growth areas of the market.” (See Accenture stock chart on TipRanks)



Girard added, “This acquisition would cement Accenture’s standing as a leading Strategy and Consulting firm for Financial Services clients in France and beyond, taking our innovative end-to-end solutions to new levels of speed and scale.”



On June 10, Susquehanna analyst James Friedman reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and a price target of $325 (14.1% upside potential).



After interacting with Accenture’s top brass, Friedman is optimistic that Accenture is being driven increasingly by artificial intelligence, which the company sees as a core strength to innovate “atop the cloud.”



Consensus on the Street is a Strong Buy based on 7 Buys and 2 Holds. The ACN average analyst price target of $308.22 implies 8.2% upside potential. That’s on top of a 40.3% run-up in the share price over the past year.

Qudian Inc (QD) is expected to report earnings before the market opens, while Anterix (ATEX), Azure Power Global (AZRE), and Oracle (ORCL) are expected to report after the market close.



Torchlight Energy Resources (TRCH) was the most actively traded stock in pre-market trading, with 7.7 million shares having changed hands at the time of writing. Recently, the oil and gas exploration company announced a special dividend of Series A Preferred Stock, which will be issued on a one-for-one basis to common stockholders of record as on June 24, 2021. This special dividend is declared in relation to the previously announced business combination transaction with Metamaterial, Inc., which recently received shareholders’ approval.



Clearside Biomedical (CLSD) was the biggest gainer in pre-market trading as the stock rose 50% at the time of writing. Recently, the biopharmaceutical company came out with positive safety results of Cohort 1 of OASIS. This is the company’s ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial of CLS-AX, which is administered by suprachoroidal injection via Clearside’s SCS Microinjector in six patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD).



Clearside Chief Medical Officer commented, “We are very encouraged by the Cohort 1 results of the OASIS trial and we are immediately beginning Cohort 2 enrollment as planned. The initial data from Cohort 1 clearly achieved our safety and tolerability endpoints. While still early and recognizing there are a limited number of patients, we believe the Cohort 1 data supports our hypothesis that the combination of targeted and compartmentalized suprachoroidal delivery and the potent pan-VEGF attributes of axitinib may facilitate an effective treatment option for patients suffering from wet AMD.”



Document Security Systems (DSS) was the biggest laggard in pre-market trading, as the stock dropped around 40.9% at the time of writing. Recently, the packaging and security printing solutions provider announced the pricing of an underwritten common stock public offering of 29 million shares at a price of $1.50 per share.



The gross proceeds of the offering are likely to be $43.5 million, excluding underwriting discounts and commissions, and other costs. These proceeds are expected to be channeled into growth, development, opportunistic acquisitions, and other general corporate needs.



Notably, the underwriters have been granted a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 15% of shares of common stock offered to cover over-allotments, if any. This option, if exercised in full, is anticipated to enhance the total gross proceeds of the offering to around $50 million.



In M&A news, Accenture (ACN), the global professional services company, has revealed the acquisition of umlaut, an engineering consulting and services firm. The acquisition will strengthen the company’s Industry X capabilities. The terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.



A rise in demand for digital technologies like cloud, artificial intelligence, and 5G was recorded due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the buyout will enable Accenture to meet the growing demand of its clients by offering them enhanced services and helping them to adopt digital techniques in a better and easier way. Furthermore, Accenture’s Industry X design, innovation, and product development capacities will be boosted, and that will help companies address the shift to digitalization.



Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said, “We predicted that digital would ultimately be applied at scale to the core of a company’s business – the design, engineering and manufacturing of their products. And, for nearly a decade Accenture has been building the unique capabilities and ecosystem partnerships to combine the power of digital with traditional engineering services.”



In other news, GE Aviation, a unit of multinational conglomerate General Electric Company (GE), together with Safran, revealed a program named CFM RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines), which targets to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by more than 20%, facilitated by open blade engines.



GE Aviation is a global provider of jet engines, components, and systems for commercial and military aircraft, while Safran is an international high-technology group operating in the aviation (propulsion, equipment, and interiors), defense, and space markets.



Through this program, a range of new and disruptive technologies will be established for future engines, which are expected to enter service by the mid-2030s. Furthermore, the technology developed under RISE will be 100% compatible with alternate energy sources such as Sustainable Aviation Fuels and hydrogen.



GE Aviation CEO John Slattery commented, “Together, through the RISE technology demonstration program, we are reinventing the future of flight, bringing an advanced suite of revolutionary technologies to market that will take the next generation of single-aisle aircraft to a new level of fuel efficiency and reduced emissions.”



Meanwhile, Clean Energy Fuels (CLNE), the provider of renewable natural gas (RNG) for the transportation industry, announced its plans to invest in the development of renewable natural gas (RNG) from dairies and other agricultural facilities. The investments will be made both independently and with partners TotalEnergies (TOT) and BP plc (BP).



Clean Energy CEO Andrew J. Littlefair said, “Clean Energy’s business has pivoted to focus on an extraordinary renewable, non-fossil fuel that can actually reduce fleets’ carbon footprint by as much as 500. The logo, color scheme, messaging, website and other brand elements that we introduced today denote a circular economy, where organic waste is turned into sustainable fuel, and embodies the role Clean Energy plays in helping our planet.”



The global investment bank and financial services holding company Bank of America (BAC) opened its first three financial centers in Kentucky and revealed its plans to add more centers in the future, with a fourth financial center coming in Lexington next year. The opening of three centers in Lexington will offer retail banking, lending and small business services, and investing and personalized financial guidance to local clients.



Bank of America’s regional executive for expansion markets Felicia Lewis said, “Bank of America has been serving clients in Kentucky for over 40 years through Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, lending to and supporting the growth of local businesses, and through active involvement in the communities we serve. Our new financial centers enable us to deliver high-tech, high-touch service and a full range of capabilities that can help to further enhance the financial lives of our clients.”



Moderna, Inc. (MRNA) has submitted an application to Swissmedic for the authorized use of its COVID-19 vaccine in adolescents in Switzerland. Last week, an application for emergency use authorization (EUA) with the FDA was also submitted by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology company to administer the vaccine to adolescents in the United States.



In May, the company announced that the Phase 2/3 TeenCOVE study of its COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) met its primary immunogenicity endpoint in adolescents. The study showed no cases of COVID-19 infection in individuals administered with two doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, using the primary definition. Furthermore, the vaccine represented an efficacy of 93% in seronegative participants 14 days after receiving the first dose, when using the secondary CDC case definition of COVID-19, which tested for the milder disease.



Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel commented, “We are pleased to announce that we have submitted an authorization application for our COVID-19 vaccine with Swissmedic for use in adolescents in Switzerland. We are encouraged that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was highly effective at preventing COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infection in adolescents. We have already filed for authorization with the U.S. FDA, Health Canada and the European Medicines Agency and we will continue to file with regulatory agencies around the world for this important younger age population. We remain focused on helping to end the COVID-19 pandemic.”",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a3bf00bcb3e9d9f27b21a433b77287b5bc941114d60b713603ff9affd9b9ab4b

Accenture is on an acquisition spree. It has acquired 22 companies since 2017 to boost its Industry X capabilities. Accenture’s Industry X deals with digital technologies, software development, product engineering, user experience, and product design.



Markedly, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in demand for digital technologies like cloud, artificial intelligence, and 5G.

Through this acquisition, umlaut’s team of over 4,200 professionals across 17 countries will join Accenture’s Industry X services, which will further enhance the company’s capabilities across a varied range of industries, the company said.



Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said, “We predicted that digital would ultimately be applied at scale to the core of a company’s business – the design, engineering and manufacturing of their products. And, for nearly a decade Accenture has been building the unique capabilities and ecosystem partnerships to combine the power of digital with traditional engineering services.” (See Accenture stock analysis on TipRanks)



Sweet added, ""COVID-19 has accelerated the need for companies to transform these core operations, and umlaut’s leading and highly-specialized engineering services will enhance our ability to meet the accelerating demand and also continue innovating for our clients.""



On June 10, Susquehanna analyst James Friedman reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $325 price target (13.8% upside potential).



After interacting with Accenture's management, Friedman remains optimistic about Accenture’s business and expects it to continue to perform well, driven by strength in Artificial Intelligence.



The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 8 Buys versus 3 Holds. The Accenture average analyst price target of $301.73 implies 5.6% upside potential to current levels. Shares have increased 15.7% over the past six months.
