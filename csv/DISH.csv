More explicitly, the Network Services Agreement requires Dish to enable existing and potential customers of its retail wireless brands to access its coverage and connectivity on AT&T's wireless network, as well as on the new DISH 5G network.



Notably, the partnership will expedite Dish’s efforts to extend the reach of its wireless distribution to rural markets. AT&T will also provide transport and roaming services to back the DISH 5G network, as part of the deal.



The partnership is important to Dish, as it will help the company leverage AT&T’s reliable and fast 5G network, which already serves 250 million people across the country over sub-6 spectrum and millimeter wave spectrum.



Markedly, Dish is on track to develop America’s first cloud-native, OpenRAN-based 5G network, which will spread out to more than 70% of the population by 2023. (See Dish stock chart on TipRanks)



John Swieringa, Dish COO and Group President of Retail Wireless, said, “Teaming with AT&T on this long-term partnership will allow us to better compete in the retail wireless market and quickly respond to changes in our customers' evolving connectivity needs as we build our own first-of-its kind 5G network.”



On June 25, Redburn Partners analyst Stephen Malcolm initiated coverage of Dish Network with a Hold rating on the stock and a price target of $43, implying a 8.86% upside potential to current levels.



Malcolm said, “Dish holds the keys to future US wireless sector returns. Having accumulated 113MHz of idle spectrum, it is finally embarking on its long-awaited entry into the mobile market...It is impossible to justify the current share price if that is chairman Charlie Ergen’s plan. We think a sale to Comcast is Dish’s best option, but given the uncertainties, this can hardly be a ‘base case.’”



Consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 5 Buys, 6 Holds and 2 Sells. The average Dish Network price target of $47.54 implies 21.8% upside potential to current levels.

Rather than buy all the gear it needs to support the network, the company will leverage the Open Radio Access Network (O-Ran). Dish uses software to run functions on standardized computer hardware. (See Dell stock charts on TipRanks)



The use of O-RAN will allow Dish to mix hardware and services from different vendors instead of relying on one vendor, such as Nokia (NOK).



""We can put the servers at the bottom of the tower, or we can centralize 10, 15 or 50 sites … The beauty of this edge cloud is the software can be placed where we want it,"" said Dish's executive Marc Rouanne.



Pivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak has upgraded the stock to a Buy from a Hold and increased the price target to $60.00 from $50, implying 45.5% upside potential to current levels. According to the analyst, the price target is conservative, given Dish's prospects around the 5G network.



Wlodarczak  stated, “DISH is in the process of rolling out what we view as a revolutionary cloud-native/software-driven 5G network with key partner AWS (AMZN, N/R) that should allow them/developers/AWS to relatively quickly develop 5G applications/services that have the potential to revolutionize wireless, particularly in enterprise market.""



Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 5 Buys, 3 Holds, and 2 Sells. The average analyst Dish price target of $49.22 implies 19.38% upside potential to current levels.



DISH scores 4 out of 10 on TipRanks' Smart Score rating system, suggesting that the stock is likely to perform in line with market averages.

Oracle sells business software and competes for cloud market share with Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google. Dish is building a cloud-based 5G network as it works to expand its wireless business and diversify outside its legacy satellite pay-TV market. It has selected Oracle Cloud to provide the service-based architecture for the 5G network. “Oracle’s capabilities will essentially serve as the control tower of our network core, enabling our customers to consume software on demand,” said Marc Rouanne, chief network officer at Dish Wireless. The financial terms of the deal were not revealed, but it gives Oracle an important role in Dish’s 5G network build-out project. In addition to the Dish Wireless contract, Oracle also announced teaming up with Oxford University in an arrangement that involves using its cloud resources to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal is to speed up genetic analysis of the coronavirus to help identify variants quickly. The outbreak of new COVID-19 strains is frustrating the efforts to bring the pandemic to an end. (See Oracle stock analysis on TipRanks) On April 23, Wolfe Research analyst Alex Zukin initiated coverage on Oracle stock with a Hold rating and a $75 price target. Zukin’s price target points to 4.93% downside potential. The analyst observed that Oracle’s business has not been growing well lately and needs to improve for the stock to rise. “We ultimately believe ORCL needs to show mid-single digit growth for shares to meaningfully re-rate and outperform other software stocks over a multi-year horizon,” noted Zukin. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 8 Buy and 14 Hold ratings. The average analyst price target of $74.42 implies 5.67% downside potential to current levels. ORCL scores an 8 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating the stock is likely to outperform the market.

Dish primarily operates a satellite pay-TV service, but also entered the wireless business last year, when it acquired Boost Mobile. In a recent winning move, Amazon (AMZN) chose Dish to provide infrastructure for its cloud-based 5G network. The debt offering will be subject to market conditions and will involve the sale of senior notes. Dish will sell the notes only to qualified institutional investors, the company said in a press release. More details on Dish’s debt offering plan are expected as the company hasn’t yet revealed the notes’ maturities. Dish’s broadcast subsidiary intends to use the money from the debt offering to fund general corporate needs, including repayment of some of its existing debts. The tapping of the debt market now comes at a time when borrowing is cheap because of low interest rates. Companies can borrow cheaply now to replace expensive debts taken earlier. Notably, the debt offering plan follows a strong first-quarter performance. Profit and revenue jumped from a year ago despite Dish's loss of pay-TV and wireless subscribers. The company reported revenue totaling $4.50 billion for the quarter ending March 31, 2021, compared to $3.22 billion for the corresponding period in 2020. (See Dish Network stock analysis on TipRanks) On the back of Dish’s strong Q1 earnings results, Pivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak reiterated a Hold rating but lifted the price target on the stock to $50 from $34. Wlodarczak’s new price target indicates 7.62% upside potential to the current price. The analyst noted that discussions by Dish management about the company’s wireless efforts are encouraging, supporting the price upgrade. However, he maintained the Hold rating is preserved due to two factors. For one, the stock has already had a substantial run. Additionally, launches of new products are likely to be hit by delays. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 3 Buy, 4 Hold, and 1 Sell ratings. The average analyst price target of $46.88 implies 0.90% upside potential to current levels. DISH scores a 9 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating the stock is likely to outperform the market.

Per the terms of the deal, AWS will act as DISH’s preferred cloud provider and DISH will build its 5G network on AWS. Furthermore, both companies will jointly work to transform how organizations and customers, including AWS and Amazon (AMZN), order and consume 5G services or create their own private 5G networks, the company said. Notably, DISH (DISH) plans to deploy its first standalone, cloud-based 5G Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) in the US, starting with Las Vegas later in 2021. AWS’s well-established infrastructure and wide range of services will aid DISH in deploying a cloud-native 5G network. It should be noted that the 5G network incorporates O-RAN, the antennas and base stations, which link phones and other wireless devices to the network, and the 5G Core, which directs traffic flow within the network. Additionally, DISH’s fully automated Operation and Business Support Systems (OSS and BSS) will also be enhanced, which will help the company in provisioning and operating its customers’ 5G workloads and monetizing its network. (See Amazon stock analysis on TipRanks) Through the DISH network on AWS, the process of creating new 5G applications will be simplified. What’s more, developers of both DISH and AWS will be able to create innovative 5G solutions for various industries through leveraging standardized application programming interfaces (APIs), which will connect with data on DISH network attributes. AWS CEO Andy Jassy said, “DISH’s cloud-native and truly virtualized 5G network is a clear example of how AWS customers can use our proven infrastructure and unparalleled portfolio of services to reinvent industries. This collaboration means DISH and its customers can bring new consumer- and enterprise-centric services to the market as quickly as they’re created to deliver on the promise of 5G. Together, we’re opening the door to new technologies that will transform factories, workplaces, entertainment, and transportation in ways people have only dreamed.” On April 21, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein reiterated a Buy rating and increased the price target to $4,200 (24.9% upside potential) from $4,100, as he sees AMZN as the firm’s “best large-cap pick.” Helfstein said, “We are raising our AWS revenue estimates ahead of 1Q results. Our non-AWS estimates remain unchanged. Post 1Q earnings focus will continue to be on AMZN’s investment plans, as it recorded $11B in one-time COVID-19-related costs in 2020. We expect funds to be redeployed to expand grocery, pharmacy, and advertising.” The consensus rating is a Strong Buy based on 32 unanimous Buys. The average analyst price target stands at $4,106.60 and implies upside potential of 22.2% to current levels. Shares have gained 42.3% over the past year. On top of this, Amazon scores an 8 out of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

(AWS) as its preferred cloud provider and will construct its 5G network on AWS under Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) deal. Dish will launch its 5G network in Las Vegas in the third quarter, as per the Financial Times report. The public cloud shift and the use of smaller suppliers, called ‘Open RAN’, were vital to regaining a footing in the global telecoms market following the regulatory crackdowns on Huawei Technologies’ equipment use in markets including the U.S. and U.K., Dish Chair Charlie Ergen said. Dish utilized capacity on T-Mobile U.S. Inc’s (NASDAQ: TMUS) 4G services network. It has planned to incur $8 billion to $10 billion on its 5G network build-up. The company has also expended $25 billion on the spectrum. Dish’s licenses mandated it to connect 20% of the U.S. population to the 5G network by June next year. Amazon won the Dish deal by beating the likes of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, Ergen said. The telecom industry attracted large U.S. technology companies in the past two years following the shift in telecom functions to the cloud. Amazon’s upcoming CEO Andy Jassy expected more telecom companies to follow Dish’s example over the coming years to focus their limited resources on network expansion and customer services instead of in-house data centers. The “expensive and slower” current network architecture drove the 5G shift added Jassy. Amazon failed to enter the mobile handset market and is estimated to launch its wireless brand recently. Amazon aimed to partner with the telecoms industry via AWS, as 5G and edge computing drove the need for processing power across the mobile network, according to Jassy. Disruptive Analysis founder Dean Bubley expected the broader telecom sector shift to the public cloud to occur “in stages” as some parts of a network could not be “cloudified.” Dish is betting on the AWS deal to compete with Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE: VZ), AT&T Inc (NYSE: T), and T-Mobile U.S. Inc. Price action: DISH shares traded higher by 8.59% at $40.06 on the last check Wednesday.

The company’s first 5G service will launch sometime in the third quarter using Amazon Web Services in Las Vegas, the first city in an eventual nationwide expansion. No financial terms were given.The agreement is a crucial piece of Dish’s 5G strategy and comes nearly four years after Chairman Charlie Ergen said he was seeking a key partner that shared his vision of putting the company’s treasure trove of airwaves to use in a futuristic wireless network. Dish, a pay-TV provider with 11.3 million subscribers, is spending $10 billion to transform itself into a cloud-based wireless carrier to challenge giants like AT&T.Shares of Dish rose as much as 4.4% to $39.61 Wednesday in New York, a 52-week high and their biggest intraday gain since December. New State Research called the deal “a ‘foot-in-the-door’ with a critical partner that provides strong validation of the opportunity ahead for Dish.”Dish has the fourth-largest holding of wireless airwaves in the U.S., but almost none of it is in service yet. By using a so-called cloud-native network, Dish will be able to nimbly scale capacity up and down, depending on traffic, and deliver a range of applications, from heavy-data processing for businesses to simple texts to consumer phones.Later Start“We definitely share the same vision with AWS,” said Marc Rouanne, Dish’s chief network officer.Dish is entering the 5G race behind T-Mobile US Inc., Verizon and AT&T, which already offer the service. But there are still very few 5G users, applications or revenue, suggesting the market remains wide open. Promoters of 5G services say they will enable innovations like immersive gaming and self-driving vehicles.AWS will serve as the core of Dish’s network, allowing the upstart 5G provider to outsource its data operations in much the same way other businesses have turned to outside IT and cloud-services providers for data management. For Englewood, Colorado-based Dish, this means that mobile traffic picked up by a tower antenna will be immediately connected to the AWS cloud.While AWS has tinkered in wireless, including a 5G edge-computing partnership with Verizon, this move with Dish is the first attempt to replicate core elements of a telecommunications network in the cloud.AWS, the largest seller of cloud-computing services, has worked in recent years to make its products more valuable to customers in potentially lucrative fields like telecommunications, health care and defense. The division had $45.4 billion in revenue last year.“A cloud partner like Amazon a gives us a low starting cost,” Rouanne said. Unlike the massive hardware and network-operation expenses of traditional carrier networks, “we will connect devices in a very cost-effective manner.

On Dec. 24 announced a multi-year carriage agreement with Nexstar Media Group.The agreement provides Dish (DISH) TV subscribers with a countrywide facility to tune in to Nexstar-owned programming, including news, entertainment and sports. Shares declined 1.4% at after-hours trading on Thursday.Under the terms of the agreement, local stations and WGN America were immediately reinstated on Dish TV. Additionally, WGN America will be available on SLING TV in early 2021 as part of an extra add-on package.The agreement was forged after Nexstar Media cut off local programming for nearly 5.4 million Dish subscribers on Dec. 2, rejecting a request to renew the contract between the companies. Nexstar had allegedly asked Dish to pay high rates and imposed tariff increases onto customers. It allegedly demanded a hefty fee of $1 billion for stations that were available for free. Nexstar also allegedly forced Dish to add WGN America as part of the subscription, which had witnessed declining viewership in recent years.On Dec. 17, Raymond James analyst Ric Prentiss reiterated a Buy rating on the stock but lowered the price target from $58 to $55 adjusting for the $2 billion convertible note offering announced on Dec. 15 with pricing announced on Dec. 17.The offering would be utilized towards general corporate purposes including 5G network buildout costs.The new price target still implies 77% upside potential. (See DISH stock analysis on TipRanks)Overall, the rest of the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on the stock. The Moderate Buy analyst consensus is based on 3 Buys and 2 Holds. With shares, down 12.4% year-to-date, the average price target stands at $49.50 and implies an upside potential of 59.4% to current levels.Related News:Dish Plans To Sell $2B In Convertible Notes; Shares Drop 4.7% Pre-MarketMastercard Sees Shift in Online Spending as U.S. Retail Sales Grow 3%Nike or Under Armour: Which Stock Is A Better Retail Play?",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=01cc6da8385737237fa15c5622004ee1aa5e5a4876f548e08ce56bc71c373a36
