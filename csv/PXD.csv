U.S. crude inventories are at the lowest since February following the biggest decline in two months, according to the Energy Information Administration. At the same time, a gauge for gasoline demand ticked higher for a seventh straight week. That’s helped prices that have struggled to rally past $60 a barrel.“There’s always bearish factors in any market, but now that we’ve broke out to the upside, it likely means we’re going to retest the old highs, if not go through them,” said Bill O’Grady, executive vice president at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis.See also: U.S. Oil Demand Picks Up Steam as Economic Expansion QuickensBoth U.S. and global benchmark crude futures have also topped their 50-day moving averages.The stronger outlook for U.S. demand, along with improvements in China, earlier drove the International Energy Agency to lift its forecast for oil consumption this year. The IEA report follows similar moves by the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase demand estimates for 2021. All three pointed to an improving economic outlook and the rapid roll-out of vaccines, particularly in the U.S.The EIA report showed the four-week rolling average of U.S. gasoline supplied has been on a multi-week climb back toward 9 million barrels a day, while refineries have been processing crude at the highest level since the early days of the pandemic. That comes as New York City toll traffic is set for its busiest April in at least seven years, while some see nationwide gasoline consumption having a record summer.A measure of jet fuel demand topped 1 million barrels a day last week for the fifth straight week, as Transportation Security Administration daily passenger data shows foot traffic above the 1 million every day since early March.“The crude draw and the very slight increase in gasoline inventories speaks to the whole setup of recovering demand and balancing inventories,” said Quinn Kiley, a portfolio manager at Tortoise, a firm that manages roughly $8 billion in energy-related assets. “It’s a stark difference compared to this time last year.”It’s not just the U.S. that’s seeing green shoots of a return to normal consumption. Data from the U.K. showed road use was at 91% of pre-pandemic levels on Monday, the strongest daily reading since November. Meanwhile, in lifting its demand outlook, the IEA noted strength in other key demand hubs. Japan, for example, saw its oil demand top pre-pandemic levels for the second month in a row in February.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=5461053727dd642b90155acbbe4667c384350058c1644128066daa13fd2bd695

This impressive charge forward has come as investors shrug off COVID-19’s devastating impact on the economy. Going ahead, Raymond James strategist Tavis McCourt believes we’re looking at a prolonged period of higher interest rates, higher taxes, and abundant economic growth. ""[It] seems very likely the puck is going to be in a very strong economy, low unemployment, with higher long term rates, and likely higher tax rates in the next 6-12 months. The bias for EPS this year is likely higher as re-openings occur, as any EPS misses are likely to be driven by supply issues or inflation, not lack of demand,"" McCourt noted. Sustained improvement in the economic indicators paint a rosy picture, and McCourt believes that some of the potential negatives (the Biden Administration’s policy preference toward higher tax rates, for example) are already priced in. As the tide rises, we remember one of JFK’s famous lines: “A rising tide lifts all boats.” We’ll take a look at a piece of that rising tide, through the stock picks by some of McCourt’s Raymond James colleagues. They’ve pointed out equities with upwards of 60% gains in store for the year ahead. After running the tickers through TipRanks’ database, it’s clear the rest of the Street is in agreement, with each earning a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) We’ll start in Texas, in the oil patch of the Permian Basin, where Pioneer Natural Resources is a major landholder and hydrocarbon exploration and extraction company. Pioneer has over 1.27 billion barrels of oil equivalent in proven reserves on its holdings; that number includes 357 million barrels added through exploration in 2020. Operations on its holdings yielded Q4 earnings of $1.07 per share, beating consensus estimates of $0.69 per share. For the full-year 2020, Pioneer reported a net loss of $1.21 per share; this number was heavily impacted by disruptions due to the COVID pandemic crisis. Furthermore, 2020 saw operating cash flow reach $2.1 billion, with a free cash flow of $689 million. The company used that free cash flow to fund a capital return program totaling $521 million. A large part of the capital return is made through the company dividend, which in the last declaration was raised one penny to 56 cents per common share, paid quarterly. The company has built on its solid position by acquiring, effective this month, competitor DoublePoint Energy. The acquisition cost Pioneer the equivalent of $6.4 billion – divided up as 21.2 million shares of PXD common shares, $1 billion in cash, and the remainder, $900 million, in the assumption of debt and liabilities. Covering PXD for Raymond James, analyst John Freeman writes of the acquisition: “We anticipate meaningful efficiency improvements from longer laterals on the acquired acreage in addition to the typical G&A and interest synergies. The 97,000 net acre acquisition increases PXD's Permian leasehold to >1M net acres.” The analyst added, “With the acquisition of DoublePoint Energy, Pioneer further establishes itself as the leading Permian Basin pure-play E&P with top-tier acreage position and balance sheet. The company's ability to generate meaningful FCF should be more than sufficient to fulfill its intentions to return meaningful returns to shareholders…” In line with his comments, the analyst rates PXD a Strong Buy, with a target price of $245 to indicate a one-year upside of 67%. (To watch Freeman’s track record, click here) Overall, the word of the Street is an overwhelmingly bullish one for this oil stock, as TipRanks analytics exhibit PXD as a Strong Buy. Out of 24 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 19 are bullish, and 5 remain sidelined. With a return potential of ~29%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $190.57. (See PXD stock analysis on TipRanks) NexImmune (NEXI) Shifting gears, we’ll move from the energy industry to the biotech field, where NexImmune is an early-stage biotechnology company in oncology, developing T-cell immunotherapies. In short, the company researches ways to stimulate the patient’s own immune system to fight cancer. The company has a development pipeline featuring two lead drug candidates, NEXI-001 and NEXI-002, which are in Phase 1/2 clinical trials as treatments for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), relapsed after allogeneic stem cell transplant or multiple myeloma refractory to >3 prior lines of therapy, respectively. The company has another four programs in various stages of early preclinical development. In the fourth quarter last year, NexImmune announced that the first patient has been dosed in the Phase 1/2 trial for NEXI-002. Also in 4Q20, initial results on the first 5 patients treated with NEXI-001 showed ‘early signs’ that the drug candidate is safe and prompts a robust immune response. NexImmune anticipates additional data on these trials in 2Q21, and a more complete set of results by the end of this year. In a move to raise capital, NexImmune in February of 2021 held an initial public offering (IPO) on the US stock exchange NASDAQ. The company put 7.441 million shares up, at a price of $17 per share. The sale, before expenses, grossed $126.5 million for the company. NexImmune’s move to the NASDAQ prompted Raymond James analyst Steven Seedhouse to initiate coverage on the stock. The analyst rates NEXI an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $30 price target, which implies a 64% upside over the coming year. (To watch Seedhouse’s track record, click here) “Individually, we view NexImmune's programs as high risk/high reward (i.e. low PoS but high unadjusted revenue potential), plus in aggregate we view the platform as likely to yield a successful therapeutic with guidance by an experienced management team,” Seedhouse opined. The analyst added, ""NexImmune's AIM ACT technology is related to a cell therapy called tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and [rival] Iovance has shown promising data in Phase 2 study of TIL lifileucel in metastatic melanoma. Unlike the more targeted NEXI-001, lifileucel consists of a highly variable mix of T cell clonotypes. We think Iovance's market cap north of $4B is an aspirational target for NexImmune."" This company has only had time to pick up three analyst reviews since it started trading on the US markets – but all three are to Buy, making the analyst consensus on the stock a Strong Buy. The shares are currently priced at $18.28 and have an average target of $33.33, which suggests an upside of ~82% this year.

It’s the largest acquisition of a closely held oil company since 2011.Big funds were among the most-acquisitive suitors in North American shale fields such as the Permian Basin, planning to flip their holdings to giant public companies for quick profits. But the strategy collapsed as debt-fueled drillers contributed to a global crude glut, oil markets shuddered and would-be buyers of PE-backed explorers turned their backs.Deals like Pioneer’s takeover of DoublePoint have been few and far between. Over the past year, transactions have been dominated by public companies merging with each other in all-stock deals, rather than snapping up private equity-backed entities. But DoublePoint offered something different from its peers, co-CEO Cody Campbell said in an interview.“The bar has gotten so high because the market has got so disciplined that a deal needs to add cash flow on Day One,” Campbell said in an interview. “It can’t just be the right prospect, can’t just have the right acreage, it has to be something that can fold into a larger company and provide accretion. We had a very tall task to get there.”Pioneer made the case that the deal would improve key financial metrics and increase dividend prospects without adding much debt. Crucially, CEO Scott Sheffield pledged to slow DoublePoint’s rapid growth in order to harvest more cash, cutting the number of rigs active across its assets to five from seven.Analysts have been mixed on the deal. Credit Suisse Group AG and Cowen & Co. raised target prices for Pioneer’s stock, noting expectations for improved cash flow. Meanwhile, KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. and Scotiabank questioned the price to be paid and whether Pioneer even needed to bulk up its portfolio.Pioneer fell along with its peers on Monday, declining 7.6% to $152.18 at 4:15 p.m. in New York, as international and U.S. crude prices slumped.The transaction will “represent something of a litmus test of a healthy company with ample inventory pursuing an acquisition for prices that are off the bottom,” Scott Gruber at Citigroup Inc. wrote in a note.Higher CadenceEven if similar deals don’t come to immediate fruition, it’s clear that many smaller, private companies are as focused on pursuing the cash flow model as their public counterparts. The problem for the industry is that many private companies need to first build production to a point at which they can begin earning money. That means a lot more oil supply at a time when demand is still weak due to the pandemic.“We have to get to free cash flow positive before a public company can buy one of our private companies,” Wil Vanloh, co-founder of Quantum, said before the DoublePoint deal was announced. Therefore “we’re willing to run a higher rig cadence than we’re used to. That is something that a lot of private equity funds are realizing.”Other closely held Permian explorers that may be attractive to buyers include Mewbourne Oil Co., Endeavor Energy Resources and Crownquest Operating LLC, according to William Janela, a New York-based analyst at Credit Suisse. The trio is running a combined 22 rigs in the Permian, more than Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. combined.“Any next wave of consolidation will need to include ‘roll-up’ of larger” closely held outfits, he said.(Adds new chart; updates share price in eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e86f354ac9d3602a7f822980d527e4a46c2ab73b16018cbf7850e7cec541022b

Shares of the independent oil and gas exploration and production company lost around 2% in Monday’s pre-market session. Pioneer (PXD) CEO Scott D. Sheffield said, “DoublePoint has amassed an impressive, high quality footprint in the Midland Basin, comprised of tier one acreage adjacent to Pioneer’s leading position. We are pleased with their decision to become long-term partners with Pioneer in a transaction that will complement our unmatched position in the core of the Permian Basin.” The deal value reflects 27.2 million shares of Pioneer common stock and cash worth $1 billion, along with the assumption of debt and liabilities worth $0.9 billion. The company intends to finance the cash portion of the purchase through a combination of existing cash balance and borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility. The deal is expected to be accretive to Pioneer’s key financial metrics, including cash flow and free cash flow per share, earnings per share, and corporate returns during 2021 and thereafter. Also, annual cost synergies of $175 million through operational efficiencies and reductions in general and administrative (G&A) and interest expenses are estimated. Furthermore, in line with Pioneer’s priority of returning capital to shareholders, the accretion of the deal to free cash flow is likely to increase the expected per share variable dividend beginning in 2022. (See Pioneer stock analysis on TipRanks) The transaction, which awaits regulatory approvals, is likely to close in the second quarter of this year. Upon completion of the transaction, existing Pioneer shareholders will own 89% of the combined entity, while existing DoublePoint shareholders will own the remaining 11%. Following the deal announcement, Siebert Williams Shank & Co analyst Gabriele Sorbara increased the stock’s price target to $200 (21.5% upside potential) from $184 and maintained a Buy rating. Sorbara believes “PXD deserves to trade at a wide premium to other large caps and Permian players considering its tremendous running room, low leverage, strong free cash flow and potential cash return to shareholders.” Pioneer shares have exploded 115.9% over the past year, while the stock still scores a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 17 Buys and 3 Holds. That’s alongside an average analyst price target of $180.40, which implies 9.6% upside potential to current levels. On top of this, Pioneer scores a 9 out of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter. Bloomberg News reported earlier that the companies were close to an agreement.Pioneer will increase its position to more than 1 million net acres through the deal, acquiring “primarily undrilled” new land.“DoublePoint has amassed an impressive, high quality footprint in the Midland Basin,” Pioneer Chief Executive Officer Scott D. Sheffield said in the statement, referring to land within the larger Permian shale play. The deal will generate “significant value for our shareholders.”The acquisition will be one of the largest in North America’s oil industry this year, and the first big transaction since the rapid run-up in oil prices to more than $60 a barrel over the past five months. DoublePoint’s investors include Apollo Global Management Inc., Quantum Energy Partners, Magnetar Capital and Blackstone Group Inc.’s GSO Capital Partners.Sheffield is expanding in the Permian Basin in the aftermath of the worst oil-industry collapse in history. Crude prices have advanced 27% this year, more than erasing 2020’s slump, amid increasing optimism that economies will continue to reopen, sparking demand for gasoline, diesel and other fuels.The deal is the latest in a series of transactions as U.S. drillers consolidate in an effort to survive the upheavals caused by the pandemic. Pioneer in October agreed to buy Parsley Energy for $4.5 billion in stock, which followed a $9.7 takeover by ConocoPhillips of Concho Resources Inc.“Pioneer is favorably positioned to emerge as one of the large, independent survivors of Permian consolidation,” Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Industry Analyst Vincent G. Piazza said in a note. The company’s recent deals have created “a formidable rival in the basin, with enviable scale and asset concentration.”DoublePoint was founded by co-CEOs Cody Campbell and John Sellers, who made their names flipping drilling leases in the Eagle Ford region of South Texas in the early days of the U.S. shale boom before moving on to the more lucrative Permian Basin. There they assembled large holdings with backing from private equity firms including Apollo. In 2017, the pair sold rights to about 70,000 acres to Parsley for $2.8 billion.Shortly thereafter, they raised more money, formed DoublePoint and set to work snapping up drilling rights in the Permian’s Midland sub-region. DoublePoint was running seven drilling rigs and was on course to produce 80,000 barrels of oil a day as of the first quarter this year.(Updates with analyst comment in eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=96e1060c0f7b43fe16f9e39d92372b8965d7c2d6e0ef4b2cca586cd1f98e3d1d
