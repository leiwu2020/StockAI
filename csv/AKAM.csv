In particular, its large product category revenue streams within Edge Technologies and Security Technologies, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets. The Akamai Technologies Analyst: Brandon Nispel upgraded the rating for Akamai Technologies from Sector Weight to Overweight, while establishing a price target of $119. The Akamai Technologies Thesis: Management surprised to the upside by guided to 30%+ growth for Edge Applications, Nispel said in the upgrade note. “AKAM's LT model calls for a 3-5 year revenue growth CAGR of 6-10% comprised of 2-5% Edge Technologies, and 20%+ Security Technologies,"" he wrote. ""Over the next 3-5 years, consensus expects 7% CAGR comprised of <1% Edge Technologies growth and <18% Security Technology growth where it appears consensus discounts AKAM's' ability to execute within both segments.” Although the company faces significant competition in both Edge and Security technologies, both businesses have a large total addressable market of more than $47 billion, “in which we see ample opportunity for all,” the analyst further mentioned.

company,1614178224,Understanding Akamai Technologies's Unusual Options Activity,66538217,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,AKAM,Yahoo,"Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) shares experienced unusual options activity on Wednesday. The stock price moved up to $97.9 following the option alert. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-02-26 Strike Price: $97.50 Volume: 0 Open Interest: 85 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being ""out of the money"". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.
