Fiserv is a leading global provider of payment and financial services technology in the U.S. (See FISV stock chart on TipRanks)



The combination of Fiserv’s popular  point-of-sale platform, Clover, with Deutsche Bank products, will create a “one-stop-shop” for thousands of clients across 800,000 SMEs, leading to a better client experience, lower costs and reduced complexity. SME clients will be able to sell their products and services across a comprehensive range of digital and in-person channels.



Furthermore, both companies intend to bring multiple payment solutions together, complementing Deutsche Bank’s banking offering. This will save merchants from entering multiple contracts with a variety of payment providers.



Subject to certain regulatory approvals, the JV will cater to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Germany and be based in Frankfurt.



John Gibbons, Head of EMEA at Fiserv, commented, ""Together with Deutsche Bank, we will be able to help small and mid-sized enterprises in Germany do business in new ways, bringing them a compelling combination of solutions and services to streamline their payment acceptance and banking capabilities.""  



Robert W. Baird analyst David Koning recently maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $148 (37.6% upside potential) on the stock.



Koning continues to favor the stock as he believes that Fiserv presents the fastest and most consistent growth in earnings, driven by improved spending at restaurants and strong economic indicators, like mobility and resurging air travel.



Overall, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 10 Buys and 3 Holds. The average Fiserv analyst price target of $142.45 implies 32.4% upside potential from current levels.

The word itself is a portmanteau, composed from financial technology. This is a sector that has risen in importance in recent years. Fintech underlies e-commerce, online banking, payment transfers, stock market analysis – the list is as endless as the combination of the financial markets and the digital world’s ingenuity. According to the Global Fintech Adoption Index for 2019, the sector grew tremendously, from 16% in 2015 to 64% in 2019. The growth came at least in part as users and customers recognized fintech’s greater agility and convenience when compared to brick-and-mortar banks and retail – but in 2020, fintech came into its own. The pandemic – or more rightly, the lockdowns in response to it – did strangle much economic activity, but it would have been a lot worse if fintech companies hadn’t facilitated our move toward digital banking and commerce. Now it’s well into 2021, and economies are reopening – but fintech remains firmly entrenched in our regular run of business. So let’s take a look at some fintech stocks, which have been getting some love from the Wall Street analysts. Looking at the TipRanks data, these are Buy-rated stocks, which according to some recent analyst reviews, boast upside that starts at 37% and heads north from there. Let’s see what else they have to offer. Affirm Holdings (AFRM) First on our list, Affirm Holdings, would tell you that sometimes, fintech means telling people, yes. The company operates a ‘loan via consumer app’ that allows quick purchases at any retailer. Affirm’s consumer loans are detailed up front, with the consumer knowing at the start how many payments will be needed and the exact payment schedule, and there are no late fees. Affirm has partnerships with Walmart and Shopify – showing the versatility of its model in both brick-and-mortar and online retail. This company held its IPO early this year, in mid-January. The launch saw 24.6 million shares of AFRM issued on the NASDAQ, at $49 per share. That price was well above expectations; the Street had predicted the initial pricing between $41 and $44, while the company itself had initially planned to start the stock in the range of $33 to $38. The IPO, at the higher price, raised just over $1.2 billion capital. In February, the company released its first quarterly results as a public entity. The release covered Q2 of fiscal 2021, the last before the IPO. Among the highlights in the report: $204 million in total revenue, up 57% year-over-year; $89.9 million in revenue less transaction costs, up 141% yoy; and 4.5 million active consumer users as of the end of calendar 2020, up 52% yoy. The company also reported a 7% increase in transactions per active consumer. Despite the successful IPO and the gains in reported revenue, the company’s stock has been slipping since it peaked in mid-February. However, RBC’s Daniel Perlin thinks some serious growth is on the horizon. “We believe Affirm is well positioned to capitalize on the secular growth of Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) as a payment method at the POS,” the 5-star analyst wrote. “Broadly, BNPL is incremental to merchants & disruptive to alternative forms of payments. Given Affirm’s product offerings, we expect its financial model will support a 30%+ revenue CAGR over the next three years.” In line with this bullish outlook, Perlin rates the stock as Outperform (i.e., a Buy), and his $155 price target implies a one-year upside potential of a hefty 169%. (To watch Perlin’s track record, click here.) There are 10 analyst ratings on AFRM shares, and they break down 6 to 4 in favor of Buy versus Hold, giving the stock a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average price target is $107.60, suggesting an upside of 87% from the current trading price of $57.60. (See Affirm’s stock analysis at TipRanks.) PagSeguro Digital, Ltd. (PAGS) Next up, PagSeguro, is part of Brazil’s Universo Online service, the country’s largest internet portal. It was founded originally as UOL’s online payment provider, and has since expanded to point-of-service payments. The company focuses on small entrepreneurs, micro-merchants, small- and mid-sized companies, and consumers in Brazil. Pag has in recent years been moving into digital banking for individual online accounts. Pag showed mixed results in its last financial report, for 4Q20. Net earnings dropped due to an increase in total expenses. By the numbers, the company saw US$69.8 million in net income for the quarter, down 4.1% year-over-year. At the same time, net revenues were up, by 32.6% yoy, to US$388 million. The top line gains were driven by increases in payment volume and users; Pag reported a 61.2% yoy increase in payment volume, while active merchants on the platform rose from 6.3 million in Q3 to 7 million in Q4. In April, Pag made a major move into the mobile world, with the launch of the PagPhone. This is an Android 10 powered smart device, combining functions of a smartphone, POS payment, and a digital bank. It is targeted at small entrepreneurs, who need mobility. Deutsche Bank’s Bryan Keane sees a clear path for Pag, writing, “PAGS plans to move further up market and go after the fast-growing SMB opportunity expecting to reach ~250- 300 hubs and ~6-11% of total company volumes over the next year. PAGS guided to +40% volume growth in FY21, which we believe could prove conservative. Although incremental investments, stimulus, and moving upmarket could weigh on take rate and margins, PAGS should positively benefit from accelerated volumes…” The 5-star analyst gives the stock a Buy rating, with a $75 price target to indicate a 71% growth potential for 2021. (To watch Keane’s track record, click here.) PagSeguro is blessed with a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 3 recent positive reviews. The stock has a share price of $43.07 and an average price target of $66.67, suggesting it has a one-year upside potential of 55%. (See PagSeguro’s stock analysis at TipRanks.) Fiserv, Inc. (FISV) Last but not least, we have Fiserv, a fintech company that aims at the service provider end of the market. Fiserv offers payment services, account and billing products, customer management, and online banking to credit unions, securities brokers, banks, and retailers. The company boasts 1.4 billion accounts globally, including 10,000 financial institutions, 6 million merchants, and 100 million digital banking users. Fiserv processes 12,000 financial transactions per second. Late in April, Fiserv released its 1Q21 results, showing $3.76 billion in revenue, flat year-over-year. EPS, at 44 cents, was flat sequentially and down from the 57 cents reported one year earlier. Year-over-year, cash flow was up; operating cash flow grew 7% to $952 million, while free cash flow grew 8% to $821 million. The earnings release included notice of two expansion agreements. In March, Fiserv made moves to acquire Pineapple Payments, a merger that is expected to close during Q2. In April, Fiserv entered into a 20-year partnership agreement with Brazil’s Caixa Economical Federal, one of that country’s largest banks. The agreement gives Fiserv an opening into the large and growing Latin American market. In his note on Fiserv’s stock, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev acknowledges the company’s mixed data from the earnings report – but writes, “We believe the positives far outweigh the concerns. Oddly, the cherry on top of the cake did not garner enough attention in our view. The 20-year agreement with Caixa — one of Brazil's largest banks — should be a top 10 relationship for FISV, adding north of 100bps to merchant growth over time… With Clover GPV accelerating to +36% in 1Q, North America seeing low-double-digit internal growth, ISVs growing +34% and global e-commerce transactions up +24%, we believe FISV is simply executing better than many of its peers.” Dolev rates the stock as a Buy, and his $160 price target suggests it has 37% growth ahead in 2021. (To watch Dolev’s track record, click here.) That Wall Street generally agrees with Dolev’s assessment is clear from the Strong Buy consensus rating, derived from 16 recent reviews that include 14 Buys and just 2 Holds. The stock’s share price is $116.59 and its average target of $140.15 implies a 20% upside from that level. (See Fiserv’s stock analysis at TipRanks.)

The average price target is $107.60, suggesting an upside of 87% from the current trading price of $57.60. (See Affirm’s stock analysis at TipRanks.)PagSeguro Digital, Ltd. (PAGS)Next up, PagSeguro, is part of Brazil’s Universo Online service, the country’s largest internet portal. It was founded originally as UOL’s online payment provider, and has since expanded to point-of-service payments. The company focuses on small entrepreneurs, micro-merchants, small- and mid-sized companies, and consumers in Brazil. Pag has in recent years been moving into digital banking for individual online accounts.Pag showed mixed results in its last financial report, for 4Q20. Net earnings dropped due to an increase in total expenses. By the numbers, the company saw US$69.8 million in net income for the quarter, down 4.1% year-over-year. At the same time, net revenues were up, by 32.6% yoy, to US$388 million. The top line gains were driven by increases in payment volume and users; Pag reported a 61.2% yoy increase in payment volume, while active merchants on the platform rose from 6.3 million in Q3 to 7 million in Q4.In April, Pag made a major move into the mobile world, with the launch of the PagPhone. This is an Android 10 powered smart device, combining functions of a smartphone, POS payment, and a digital bank. It is targeted at small entrepreneurs, who need mobility.Deutsche Bank’s Bryan Keane sees a clear path for Pag, writing, “PAGS plans to move further up market and go after the fast-growing SMB opportunity expecting to reach ~250- 300 hubs and ~6-11% of total company volumes over the next year. PAGS guided to +40% volume growth in FY21, which we believe could prove conservative. Although incremental investments, stimulus, and moving upmarket could weigh on take rate and margins, PAGS should positively benefit from accelerated volumes…”The 5-star analyst gives the stock a Buy rating, with a $75 price target to indicate a 71% growth potential for 2021. (To watch Keane’s track record, click here.)PagSeguro is blessed with a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 3 recent positive reviews. The stock has a share price of $43.07 and an average price target of $66.67, suggesting it has a one-year upside potential of 55%. (See PagSeguro’s stock analysis at TipRanks.)Fiserv, Inc. (FISV)Last but not least, we have Fiserv, a fintech company that aims at the service provider end of the market. Fiserv offers payment services, account and billing products, customer management, and online banking to credit unions, securities brokers, banks, and retailers. The company boasts 1.4 billion accounts globally, including 10,000 financial institutions, 6 million merchants, and 100 million digital banking users. Fiserv processes 12,000 financial transactions per second.Late in April, Fiserv released its 1Q21 results, showing $3.76 billion in revenue, flat year-over-year. EPS, at 44 cents, was flat sequentially and down from the 57 cents reported one year earlier. Year-over-year, cash flow was up; operating cash flow grew 7% to $952 million, while free cash flow grew 8% to $821 million.The earnings release included notice of two expansion agreements. In March, Fiserv made moves to acquire Pineapple Payments, a merger that is expected to close during Q2. In April, Fiserv entered into a 20-year partnership agreement with Brazil’s Caixa Economical Federal, one of that country’s largest banks. The agreement gives Fiserv an opening into the large and growing Latin American market.In his note on Fiserv’s stock, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev acknowledges the company’s mixed data from the earnings report – but writes, “We believe the positives far outweigh the concerns. Oddly, the cherry on top of the cake did not garner enough attention in our view. The 20-year agreement with Caixa — one of Brazil's largest banks — should be a top 10 relationship for FISV, adding north of 100bps to merchant growth over time… With Clover GPV accelerating to +36% in 1Q, North America seeing low-double-digit internal growth, ISVs growing +34% and global e-commerce transactions up +24%, we believe FISV is simply executing better than many of its peers.”Dolev rates the stock as a Buy, and his $160 price target suggests it has 37% growth ahead in 2021. (To watch Dolev’s track record, click here.)That Wall Street generally agrees with Dolev’s assessment is clear from the Strong Buy consensus rating, derived from 16 recent reviews that include 14 Buys and just 2 Holds. The stock’s share price is $116.59 and its average target of $140.15 implies a 20% upside from that level.

A decade or so later, the second business they founded is now worth $95 billion, making it the most valuable U.S. startup.The latest valuation for Stripe Inc., their online payments processing firm, gives John, 30, and Patrick, 32, a net worth of about $11.5 billion each, putting the two brothers among the richest self-made millennial billionaires in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.The valuation figure is at the top of the range Bloomberg News reported in November, when Stripe was in talks with investors. At the time, discussions were for a value of more than $70 billion with the possibility of pushing it as high as $100 billion.Its current valuation puts it ahead of billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Instacart Inc., according to CBInsights data, and surpasses the market value of publicly traded rivals including Adyen NV, Global Payments Inc. and Fiserv Inc.The Irish brothers founded Stripe in 2010 after dropping out of college in the U.S. They were previously worth $4.3 billion, according to the wealth index.Snap Inc. founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, as well as China’s Wang Ning are the only other self-made billionaires under the age of 35 among the world’s 500 richest, while U.K. aristocrat Hugh Grosvenor and Walmart Inc. heir Lukas Walton hold the sole inherited fortunes in the group.Stripe, which sells software allowing businesses to accept online payments, has been a beneficiary of the e-commerce boom accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic. The company plans to invest in its European operations, in particular its headquarters in Dublin, to support surging demand and expand its global payments and treasury network, the company said Sunday in a statement.The firm also has a headquarters in San Francisco, according to its website, and counts Baillie Gifford, Fidelity Management & Research and Sequoia Capital among its investors.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ea23d12f0a2689d2820b8c94b91ca6b1c3343583d0d9eaf29c85875950780b8c

It’s different in the stock market, even though there is a tendency to refer to stock investing as a game. Smart investors don’t have to ‘beat the house’ to come out ahead; this is not a zero-sum game. Rather, it’s a game of strategy. Successful investors will look for some edge, an ‘in’ that will lead them toward winning investments. This search naturally leads some investors to the corporate insiders – company officers and board members whose positions give them an inside track on the background that will impact stock prices. To the great good fortune of the investing public, the regulatory authorities require that inside traders regularly publish the stock transactions they make in the companies they run. This generates a wealth of information from the SEC, and TipRanks makes it easy for investors to use the raw data, with the Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool. This tool features a variety of filters letting investors search stocks by trading strategies, making sense of a difficult data set. We’ve used the data to pinpoint a pair of stocks showing two clear signals for investors: A Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, and a recent ‘informative buy’ from a company insider. Fiserv, Inc. (FISV) We will start with Fiserv, a financial tech company providing services to banks, credit unions, securities brokers, finance companies, and retailers. The company’s products include payment services, account and billing solutions, customer management and online banking, risk compliance tools, and data analytics. In short, Fiserv is a full-service fintech, with customers in a wide range of sectors, including banks, government, healthcare, insurance, telecom, and utilities. After seeing revenues slide in 1H20, Fiserv bounced back in the second half. The top line came in at $3.79 billion for Q3 and $3.83 billion for Q4; full-year revenues for 2020 reached $13.9 billion. While these were considered solid numbers, and beat expectations, the coronavirus impact was felt in year-over-year declines. Earnings, however, fared better. Fiserv registered a profit of $4.42 per share in 2020, for a 12% increase over the prior year. On the insider front, the ‘informative buy’ here was made by Denis O’Leary, Director and Chairman of the Board at Fiserv. O’Leary spent $1.01 million on 9,100 shares of FISV. Turning to the analyst community, Mizuho’s Dan Dolev believes the company has a lot going for it and a bright future. “Following marked organic outperformance vs. peers in 2020, we view FISV on track to impress again in 2021, with strong growth across the board… Investors often think of FISV as a legacy operator with fewer analytic capabilities than next-gen firms. This is not true, in our view… FISV deploys advanced analytics to measure every client interaction, investing in automation to improve engagement. While ‘the journey never ends,’ FISV is already seeing strong success in these efforts, seeing just low-single-digit senior level attrition,” Dolev commented. In line with his optimistic approach, Dolev rates FISV a Buy, and his $160 price target implies a 38% upside for the year ahead. (To watch Dolev’s track record, click here) Overall, there are no fewer than 19 reviews on file for Fiserv, and they break down 17 to 2 in favor of Buys versus Holds. This indicates a broad view on Wall Street that the stock is a buying proposition, and makes the consensus rating a Strong Buy. Shares are priced at $115.80, and their $134 average price target suggests room for ~16% growth on the one-year time horizon. (See FISV stock analysis on TipRanks) Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding (BHVN) From fintech we move to the pharmaceutical sector. Biohaven focuses on neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, and has a pipeline with therapies in various stages of development, and one treatment which has already gained FDA approval. Last year, Biohaven's NURTEC was given the go ahead for the acute treatment of migraine in adults and has been performing well since its launch. The treatment has another upcoming catalyst on the horizon. The FDA has accepted an sNDA (supplemental new drug application) for the prevention of migraine and a PDUFA date is expected in the second quarter. Turning to the insider trades, on March 2, John Childs, one of the company’s Directors, paid $851,370 for a bloc of 10,000 shares. His display of confidence gets the backing of H.C. Wainwright’s Douglas Tsao. The 5-star analyst anticipates the US approval of NURTEC in preventative migraine followed by an immediate launch. Tsao is also impressed by NURTEC's “continued linear growth.” “Despite being on the market for only about one year, NURTEC continues to take share from triptans and even mAbs used in preventative treatment, though the share is still relatively small, suggesting plenty of room for growth,” Tsao said. “Importantly, neurologist and patient attitudes towards Nurtec are overwhelmingly positive, with 58% of patients satisfied compared to just 37% on Ubrelvy, again suggesting robust growth potential based on the drug’s best-in-class attributes.” Accordingly, Tsao has a Buy rating on BHVN shares, to go alongside a $111 price target. This figure implies a 43% upside from current levels. (To watch Tsao’s track record, click here) Biohaven also has plenty of support amongst Tsao’s colleagues. The analyst consensus rates the stock a Strong Buy, based on 8 Buys and 1 Hold. At $103.13, the average price target implies gains of 33% over the next 12 months.
