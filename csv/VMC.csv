(USCR), a supplier of aggregates and ready-mixed concrete, in a cash deal valued at $1.294 billion.



Per the terms of the deal, Vulcan will buy all of the outstanding shares of U.S. Concrete at a purchase price of $74.00 per share in cash.



The transaction has been approved by the boards of both companies and is expected to close in the second half of 2021, subject to U.S. Concrete's shareholder and other regulatory approvals. (See Vulcan Materials stock analysis on TipRanks)



U.S. Concrete has 27 aggregates operations that serve California, Texas, and the Northeast. In 2020 alone, the company shipped 12.6 million tons. The acquisition of USCR proves to complement Vulcan’s existing footprint and the ready-mixed concrete operations will be advantageous in expanding Vulcan's service capabilities.



Upon closure, the deal is expected to be accretive to Vulcan’s earnings per share in the first full year post-merger and increase its EBITDA by about $190 million, excluding synergies.



Commenting on the deal, Vulcan’s Chairman and CEO, Tom Hill said, “U.S. Concrete is an important Vulcan customer in a number of key areas, and this transaction is a logical and exciting step in our growth strategy as we further bolster our geographic footprint.”



On May 4, Vulcan reported Q1 earnings of $0.56 per share (excluding gain on sale of land) surpassing the Street’s estimate of $0.45 per share. Revenue came in at $1.06 billion, outpacing analysts’ expectations of $1.02 billion. The company also raised its Adjusted EBITDA outlook for FY21 to between $1.38 and $1.46 billion.



Recently, J.P. Morgan analyst Adrian Huerta lifted the price target on the stock to $190 (6.77% upside potential) from $180 and maintained a Hold rating.



Huerta expects a new infrastructure bill to add 15% - 20% in gains to the construction materials sector, but those gains could be cut in half if accompanied by higher corporate taxes.



The Wall Street community is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 3 Buys and 4 Holds. The Vulcan average analyst price target of $193.67 implies 8.8% upside potential to current levels. Shares have gained 43.5% over the past year.

Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Vulcan Materials has. Vulcan Materials's Debt According to the Vulcan Materials's most recent financial statement as reported on November 6, 2020, total debt is at $3.29 billion, with $2.78 billion in long-term debt and $509.44 million in current debt. Adjusting for $1.08 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $2.20 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Vulcan Materials's $11.59 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.28. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and average for another. Importance Of Debt Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.
