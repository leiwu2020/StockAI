company,1625819344,3 “Strong Buy” Semiconductor Stocks Poised to Surge Higher,68770261,https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?766454363,AMAT,Nasdaq,"Semiconductors are an essential part of our daily lives. From our smartphones to personal computers to our cars and other electronic devices – these tiny silicon chips are everywhere. Over the past year, demand for semiconductors ballooned, and chipmakers struggled to satiate the market's appetite. Higher sales of consumer electronics amid the COVID-19 pandemic and their application in cars and modern technologies like 5G, AI (artificial intelligence), and cloud computing can be attributed to the rising demand.



The industry also marked a wave of consolidation. Nvidia announced the acquisition of Arm, while AMD proposed to acquire Xilinx. However, the bigger question is whether these multi-billion dollar deals will be approved. Also, as the economy is slowly getting back on its feet, pure-play foundries are busy fulfilling orders for the automotive industry, DigiTimes reported citing industry sources. 



While demand for semiconductors could remain uneven industry-wise, IDC forecasts 12.5% year-over-year growth in the semiconductor market and expects it to reach $522 billion this year. 



With an increasing focus on digitization and secular industry trends, the outlook for semiconductor stocks looks positive. Using the TipRanks database, we identified three ""Strong Buy"" semiconductor stocks with considerable upside potential. Let's take a look.



Micron (NASDAQ: MU)



Chipmaker Micron has a rich portfolio of memory and storage products that fuel the modern-day digital economy. It recently delivered robust Q3 results, reflecting 36% year-over-year growth in its revenue and a 136% jump in adjusted net income. Shares of Micron have reversed some of their gains but are up about 54% over the past year. (See Micron stock charts on TipRanks)



Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said, ""Micron is in the best position ever to capitalize on the long-term demand trends across the data center, intelligent edge and user devices."" 



Following the quarterly results, Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill maintained a Buy rating with a price target of $130 on the stock. This reflects 12-month upside potential of 68.6% from current levels. Gill expects Micron to gain from the recovery in the memory cycle. He added, ""We expect MU's top and bottom lines to benefit from growth in NAND and DRAM prices, which we expect to occur throughout 2020. Moreover, we view MU as a key beneficiary of strong data center demand and increased DRAM and NAND content in 5G handsets.""



Overall, 22 Wall Street analysts have weighed in on Micron shares in the past three months, giving the stock 17 Buys and 5 Holds for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average Micron price target of $118.79 implies approximately 54.1% upside potential to current levels.







Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO)



Broadcom manufactures a wide range of semiconductors and offers infrastructure software solutions. Strength across its multiple end markets is driving is semiconductor revenue. Meanwhile, Broadcom's CEO Hock Tan sees ""strong demand from service providers and hypercloud"" and expects ""year-over-year growth to sustain"" in Q3. 



Broadcom's consolidated revenue increased 15% during the last reported quarter. Furthermore, its operating profit jumped 25%. Thanks to strong product demand, Broadcom stock has surged nearly 46% over the past year. (See Broadcom stock charts on TipRanks)



Last month, Bank of America Securities analyst Vivek Arya reiterated his Buy rating with a price target of $580 (23.3% upside potential) on the stock and views Broadcom as an ""extremely attractive"" pick for growth and income investors. Furthermore, Broadcom's multiple growth catalysts, compelling valuation, and solid profitability are the main drivers of Arya's bull case.



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 17 Buys and 2 Holds. The average Broadcom price target of $543.71 implies approximately 15.6% upside potential to current levels.







Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT)



Shares of the chip manufacturer Applied Materials have more than doubled in one year, reflecting its strong financial performance on the back of broad-based strength across its semiconductor businesses. In Q2, Applied Materials' net sales jumped 41% year-over-year, while its net income surged 76% versus the prior-year period. (See Applied Materials stock charts on TipRanks).



Its CEO, Gary Dickerson, said, ""We are confident in our ability to outperform our markets as large, secular trends create sustainable demand for semiconductors and our leadership in materials engineering becomes increasingly critical to deliver new chip technologies.""



Following the Q2 numbers, Needham analyst Quinn Bolton maintained a buy rating with a price target of $153 (15.5% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, Bolton said, ""As the wafer fab equipment (WFE) market leader, AMAT is exposed to the secular growth of WFE, and in particular the deposition and etch segments that have outperformed WFE in the last cycle as Moore's Law has slowed down across logic, DRAM and NAND devices."" 



He added, ""compared to its closest peers, AMAT has a balanced mix of business between the logic/foundry and memory end markets, as well as the broadest product portfolio with a #1 or #2 position in multiple billion dollar categories, which should provide growth, stability, and profitability to the company for multiple years into the future.""



Overall, Applied Materials has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 10 reviews that include 8 Buys and 2 Holds. The average Applied Materials price target of $157.50 implies approximately 18.8% upside potential to current levels.

The industry urgently needs breakthroughs that can allow DRAM to scale to reduce area and cost while also operating at higher speeds and using less power. Applied Materials is working with DRAM customers to commercialize three materials engineering solutions that create new ways to shrink as well as improve performance and power. The solutions target three areas of DRAM chips: storage capacitors, interconnect wiring and logic transistors. They are now ramping into high volume and are expected to significantly increase Applied’s DRAM revenue over the next several years. Introducing Draco™ Hard Mask for Capacitor Scaling Since over 55 percent of a DRAM chip’s die area is occupied by the memory arrays, increasing the density of these cells is the biggest lever for reducing cost per bit. Data is stored as charges in cylindrical, vertically arranged capacitors that need as much surface area as possible to hold adequate numbers of electrons. As DRAM makers narrow the capacitors, they also elongate them to maximize surface area. A new technology challenge to DRAM scaling has emerged: the etching of the deep capacitor holes threatens to exceed the limits of the “hard mask” material that acts as a stencil to determine where each cylinder is placed. If the hard mask is etched through, the pattern is ruined. Taller hard masks are not viable because as the combined depth of the hard masks and capacitor holes exceeds certain limits, etch byproducts remain and cause bending, twisting and uneven depths. The solution is Draco™, a new hard mask material that has been co-optimized to work with Applied’s Sym3® Y etch system in a process monitored by Applied’s PROVision® eBeam metrology and inspection system that can take nearly half a million measurements per hour. The Draco hard mask increases etch selectivity by more than 30 percent which enables a shorter mask. Draco hard mask and Sym3 Y co-optimization includes advanced RF pulsing which synchronizes etching with byproduct removal to enable patterning holes that are perfectly cylindrical, straight and uniform. The PROVision eBeam system gives customers massive, immediate actionable data on hard mask critical dimension uniformity which is the key to capacitor uniformity. Applied’s solution provides customers with a 50-percent improvement in local critical dimension uniformity and reduces bridge defects by 100X, thus increasing yields. “The best way to quickly solve materials engineering challenges with our customers is to co-optimize adjacent steps and use massive measurements and AI to optimize process variables,” said Dr. Raman Achutharaman, group vice president, Semiconductor Products Group at Applied Materials. Bringing Black Diamond® Low-k Dielectric to the DRAM Market A second key lever of DRAM scaling is reducing the die area needed by the interconnect wiring that routes signals to and from the memory arrays. Each of the metal lines is surrounded by an insulating dielectric material to prevent interference between data signals. For the past 25 years, DRAM makers have used one of two silicon oxides – silane and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) – as the dielectric material. Continual thinning of the dielectric layers has reduced DRAM die sizes but created a new technology challenge: the dielectrics are now too thin to prevent capacitive coupling in the metal lines whereby signals interfere with one another causing higher power consumption, slower performance, increased heat and reliability risks. The solution is Black Diamond®, a low-k dielectric material first used in advanced logic. With DRAM designs now experiencing similar scaling challenges, Applied is adapting Black Diamond to the DRAM market and making it available on the highly productive Producer® GT platform. Black Diamond for DRAM enables smaller, more compact interconnect wires that can move signals through the chips at multi-gigahertz speeds without interference and at lower power consumption. High-k Metal Gate Transistors Bring PPAC Improvements to DRAM A third key lever of DRAM scaling is improving the performance, power, area and cost of the transistors used in the periphery logic of the chip to help drive the input-output (I/O) operations needed in high-performance DRAM like those based on the new DDR5 specification. Until today, DRAM used transistors based on polysilicon-oxide which were phased out in foundry-logic by the 28-nanometer node because extreme thinning of the gate dielectric allowed electrons to leak, thereby wasting power and limiting performance. Logic makers adopted high-k metal gate (HKMG) transistors, replacing the polysilicon with a metal gate and the dielectric with hafnium oxide, a material that improves gate capacitance, leakage and performance. Now memory makers are designing HKMG transistors into advanced DRAM designs to improve performance, power, area and cost. In DRAM as in logic, HKMG will increasingly replace polysilicon transistors over time. This technology inflection in DRAM creates growth opportunities for Applied Materials. The more complex and delicate HKMG materials stack is challenging to manufacture, and in-vacuum processing of adjacent steps using Applied’s Endura® Avenir™ RFPVD system has become the industry’s preferred solution. HKMG transistors also benefit from Applied’s epitaxial deposition technologies such as Centura® RP Epi along with film treatments including RadOx™ RTP, Radiance® RTP and DPN which are used to fine-tune the transistor characteristics for optimum performance. “Draco hard mask and Black Diamond low-k dielectric are being adopted by leading DRAM customers, and the first HKMG DRAMs are now being introduced,” added Dr. Achutharaman. “Applied Materials projects billions of dollars in revenue growth as these DRAM inflections play out over the next several years.” Additional information about the growth outlook for these technologies is being provided at Applied’s 2021 Memory Master Class being held later today.
