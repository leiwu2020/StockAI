Following the news, shares of the company rose 1% to close at $98.61 in Monday’s trading session.



The transaction includes all of Daniel's brand rights, facilities, intellectual property and personnel. The deal, which is likely to close in Emerson’s Fiscal Year 2021, will not include Daniel’s ultrasonic flowmeter and fiscal transfer system businesses. 



The sale denotes a strategic move by Emerson to focus its resources on software-enabled technologies with rich data in diversified and high-growth end markets. (See Emerson stock chart on TipRanks)



A Partner at Turnspire, Abel S. Osorio, said, ""Turnspire is excited to establish Daniel as an independent flow measurement and control company built on the foundation of its iconic brand, unparalleled reputation for reliability, superior technology and global installed base. We are committed to supporting the Company as it pursues its attractive organic growth opportunities and strong pipeline of strategic acquisition opportunities. We look forward to partnering with the Daniel team to further solidify the business' market leadership and invest in research and development, technology and new products.""



On July 12, Wolfe Research analyst Nigel Coe reiterated a Hold rating on the stock. The analyst, however, raised the price target from $107 to $113 (14.6% upside potential from current levels). 



The stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 8 Buys and 6 Holds. The average Emerson price target of $104.85 implies 6.3% upside potential from current levels. Shares have gained 62.1% over the past year.

The company is working with advisers as it weighs alternatives, which could also include a commercial partnership with a major manufacturer, they said.Aspen Tech makes software for companies in industries such as chemicals, manufacturing, energy, metals and mining, its website shows. Shares of the company rose as much as 2.9% Wednesday, hitting the highest intraday level in two weeks. They were up 1.1% at 9:49 a.m. in New York, giving Aspen Tech a market value of $9.5 billion.The company has long been considered an attractive takeover target for big industrial companies looking to expand in software. However, high price expectations and management reluctance have been hurdles for a full sale over the years despite interest from potential acquirers, the people said.Deliberations are ongoing and may not lead to a transaction, the people said. A representative for Bedford, Massachusetts-based Aspen Tech declined to comment.Industrial firms have been shifting their focus from machinery to technology and automation. Last year, Aveva Group Plc agreed to acquire industrial-software maker Osisoft for about $5 billion, while Emerson Electric Co. agreed to buy Open Systems International Inc. for $1.6 billion.Software companies also have sometimes sought investments from potential buyers, including industrial companies. In 2018, Rockwell Automation Inc. agreed to make a $1 billion equity investment in industrial software company PTC Inc. as part of a strategic partnership, according to a statement at the time.Honeywell International Inc., which has been seeking to marry software capabilities with its industrial know-how, agreed in December to acquire Sparta Systems for $1.3 billion to gain technology used in the life sciences industry. The company said in April it’s transferring its listing to the Nasdaq as it seeks to stress its technology focus.(Updates with share movement in third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d90e1009759b127b0a71b3be9ae4d25059edf2784627e40f0eb40386c53dd97d
