Total subscribers to all of the company’s streaming outlets stand at 15 million, Discovery said Wednesday, having crossed 13 million at the end of the first quarter.That’s up from 5.2 million in December, before the U.S. launch of Discovery+, and about 12 million in February. But investors hoped for more, conditioned to torrid growth from the likes of Walt Disney Co.’s Disney+.Discovery doesn’t disclose subscribers specifically for Discovery+ but has said they’re the majority of the company’s direct-to-consumer customers. The company has smaller streaming services targeting areas such as golf and cooking.Elsewhere, Discovery’s U.S. advertising sales fell 4% in the first quarter, with the company citing lower ratings “and to a lesser extent secular declines in the pay-TV ecosystem and lower inventory.”Discovery shares fell as much as 8.8% to $35.56 in New York trading Wednesday. The stock remains up about 55% for the past year despite wild fluctuations: It rose sharply at the start of 2021, then shed nearly half its market value after the investment firm Archegos Capital Management was forced to liquidate its equity positions.Geetha Ranganathan, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, cited “very weak advertising and Discovery+ sub growth slowing” as driving the stock declines Wednesday.Taking a rosier view, Wells Fargo analysts led by Steven Cahall said in a note that Discovery’s 15 million in total streaming subscribers are close to the firm’s estimate of 16 million for the second quarter. “We’d say the sub performance is in line to ahead of expectations,” they wrote.Earnings of 21 cents a share missed analysts’ consensus expectation of 63 cents. Revenue of $2.79 billion was about in line with Wall Street’s estimates of $2.78 billion.(Updates with shares in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=762a63dc42da0ed4dcf6c58e8604941deea619fe1f4befabc130bf2268582a7a

Yet if history repeats itself, shares may fall below the 5-year trading range of $22 – $33 a share. 7 Retail Stocks With E-commerce Locked In Multiple block trades that sent Discovery shares lower are allegedly lower. No one knows for share. Markets may ignore the company’s fundamentals until the trading uncertainties ease. Besides, the fourth-quarter results are fine but not great. In Q4, Discovery posted a lack of revenue growth at $2.89 billion. Despite U.S. advertising revenue flat and distribution revenue up 5%, international networks dragged on results. Potential Catalysts The company’s launch of Discovery+ with Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is a step in the right direction. Yet the streaming content market is very crowded, dominated by many players. This includes Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney (NYSE:DIS). Discovery reported the total share of viewing across its international portfolio rose by 4% Y/Y. The six consecutive quarters of share growth suggests a sustained momentum ahead. It boasted over 11 million total paying direct-to-consumer subscribers globally. Management proved that its investments in Discovery+ are paying off. As it scales the service, profit margins will expand. The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic is a positive contributor to Discovery+ growth. That is also a risk factor in the medium term. Many States in the U.S. vaccinated half of the residents. As each State achieves herd immunity, lockdowns will ease. People will go outdoors and will socialize. That includes going to the movies. The pivot away from streaming to other traditional channels is a risk factor for Discovery. Fair Value Investors may look to Wall Street to get an idea on what Discovery shares are worth. Yet only one analyst offered a price target of $43.00 on Discovery, over two months ago (per Tipranks). On simplywall.st, the site figured that based on future cash flow, the stock is worth around $80.00. Readers may refer to a five-year discounted cash flow model (Gorden Growth Exit) model. Based on the assumptions below, the stock has a fair value of around $37.00. Metrics Range Conclusion Discount Rate 10.0% – 9.0% 9.50% Perpetuity Growth Rate 0.0% – 0.5% 0.00% Fair Value $33.72 – $42.55 $36.63 Interactive Model courtesy of finbox Readers may raise the growth rate forecast to come up with a higher price target. Given the pressures ahead, revenue growth of around 3% – 5% annually is already an optimistic scenario. President and Chief Executive Officer David Zaslav said, “Our unmatched global scale and ability to serve consumers everywhere with a truly differentiated offering across platforms, as well as our robust cash flows, even amidst the significant investments in our next generation initiatives.” Unfortunately for income investors, the company is not sharing the robust cash flow through dividend payments. ViacomCBS pays a 96-cent annual dividend. This token payment will earn investor confidence in the competing firm’s potential. ViacomCBS may simultaneously grow its content, build its online streaming service offering and still reward investors with regular dividend income. Your Takeaway Discovery may face months of selling pressure. The stock has plenty of overhang from speculators who bought shares on the way up. Those shareholders may take any small rally to sell shares. Netflix and other streaming services firms are attractive alternative investments.

The trades follow a torrent of similar transactions that had already erased about $194 billion in market value as banks from New York to Zurich and Tokyo unwound leveraged equity bets by Bill Hwang’s family office.Shares of Credit Suisse fell as the sale adds to evidence that the Archegos collapse could impact the bank beyond the first quarter, when it took a 4.4 billion franc ($4.8 billion) writedown, its worst trading hit in more than a decade. While the Swiss bank has substantially reduced its exposure, transactions since the end of March weren’t included in the first-quarter results, a person familiar with the matter has said.Credit Suisse fell as much as 2.2% in early Zurich trading and was 1.2% lower by 9:43 a.m. The stock has lost 15% this year, compared with double-digit gains for an index that includes its European peers.A spokesperson for Credit Suisse declined to comment on the sale and whether the bank plans more such transactions.Hwang’s private investment firm became the center of one of the biggest margin calls of all time late last month, and represented one of the most spectacular failures of risk-management and oversight in recent memory. The downfall of Archegos will result in $10 billion of losses to banks, according to analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. The debacle could attract regulatory scrutiny and potential fines for the banks involved, the analysts said this week.Read more: Archegos Ripples Through Banks’ Lucrative Hedge Fund BusinessTuesday’s block trades -- which sold at the lower end of ranges -- included 19 million Class A shares of Discovery sold at $38.40, said one of the people, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter. In addition, 22 million Class C shares of Discovery sold at $32.35 while a stake of 35 million Iqiyi shares went for $15.85.Credit Suisse’s latest sale comes weeks after several rivals dumped their shares to skirt losses. While the firm was one of several global investment banks to facilitate the leveraged bets of Archegos, it was slower than others to unwind the positions and had initially tried to reach some sort of standstill agreement, people familiar with the matter have said.The strategy failed as rivals rushed to cut their losses. Global banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG have told investors that they shed their Archegos-linked positions with little financial impact.Credit Suisse is now planning a sweeping overhaul of its hedge fund business. It has already announced plans to cut its dividend, suspend share buybacks and scrap bonuses for top executives.(Updates with Credit Suisse shares from third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a1f4f181b646494161d6a61e650a47bf88b4f1d636bead69a6c062b270b35ffa

With that scenario now discarded, and with the dust from the Archegos blowup settling, analysts are saying investors should look at some of these names again.“Usually these dislocations where you get forced selling for non-fundamental reasons work out to be very good buying opportunities,” said Greg Taylor, chief investment officer at Toronto-based Purpose Investments. “The counter to that is having to figure out how much of the runup was due to the buying that shouldn’t have been there either. So you have balance that both out.”Read more: Block-Trade Bevy Wipes $35 Billion Off Stock Values in a DayTake ViacomCBS for example.Until late in March, the company was among the top performing stocks in the benchmark S&P 500 Index, alongside Discovery, boosted in part by optimism over its streaming strategy but also thanks to a massive play by Bill Hwang’s Archegos. The fund at one point amassed $10 billion worth of ViacomCBS shares and colossal positions in a few other companies.Read more: Bill Hwang Was a $20 Billion Whale, Then Lost It All in Two DaysSince Archegos’ blowup and after a 52% drop in ViacomCBS’s stock over the course of a week -- which in turn brought its valuation down by over 50% from a peak on March 22 -- at least six research firms have raised their ratings on the company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.At Wolfe Research, analyst John Janedis said in a note that ViacomCBS shares are now a buy opportunity as the media company’s valuation appeared attractive after its selloff. He also pointed to its streaming business as a potential tailwind.A similar view is also behind Deustche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft‘s decision this week to raise Discovery’s 12-month forecast to $60 from $35. The company’s improved growth outlook warrants a higher valuation, he noted. Farfetch also got a “buy” recommendation from JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth on Thursday, who said the stock delivers a “compelling buying opportunity.”No BargainsWhile the stocks caught at the center of the Archegos crisis are definitely hurting, they aren’t exactly cheap. Their average price-to-earnings ratio -- a measure which indicates how expensive a company is -- is in line with the 10-year median, which signals how high valuations had gotten before the selloff. Aside from ViacomCBS, Discovery and Farfetch, Chinese companies like GSX Techedu Inc., Tencent Music Entertainment Group, Baidu Inc., VipShop Holdings Ltd. and IQiyi Inc. were also caught in the crosshairs of Archegos.Determining whether the selloff has turned a once-overvalued stock into a good buy will require some digging, said Barry Schwartz, chief investment officer at Baskin Wealth Management.“If you’ve studied the company and you understand the business and you see this price drop as overdone, then take that opportunity to buy their shares,” Schwartz said by phone. “If you haven’t done your homework and you’re thinking this is another GameStop situation, you’re going to be the sucker at the table.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=61a4370029b9232ed87c16512ea705aacb6a6848b07ecbc7b8df596589209440

What Happened: The financial terms of the contract were not disclosed. According to the Hollywood Reporter coverage, Fieri will continue to play a prominent role in the development of new projects and the continuation of his ongoing series. “Guy Fieri infuses his unmatched energy and passion into every show he makes,” said Food Network President Courtney White. “He is truly one-of-a-kind, adored globally for his own love of food and his deep appreciation for the people behind the restaurant scenes. I am beyond thrilled to be able to continue this extraordinary, creative partnership.” Fieri first came to Food Network in 2006 as a contestant on the second season of “The Next Food Network Star.” He now hosts and produces three of the network’s most popular shows: “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives” (in its 33rd season), “Guy’s Grocery Games” (in its 25th season) and “Tournament of Champions” (debuted in 2020). He also executive produced and co-directed, “Restaurant Hustle 2020: All on the Line,” a documentary on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on U.S. restaurants. Related Link: What Happened With Discovery B Stock Today? Why It Matters: Fieri’s star power transcends cable television. Earlier this year, he quietly opened a series of ""ghost kitchens"" in 23 states and Washington D.C. under Guy Fieri's Flavortown Kitchen banner. This new venture works within existing restaurant kitchens and provides delivery offerings. Fieri is also one of the highlighted stars in the new Discovery+ streaming service launched on March 23. All of the past seasons of Fieri’s Food Network programs are part of the service’s program slate.

The rally caused the price of the securities to come untethered from Discovery’s more popular A class of stock.The cause of the jump was unclear. Very few Class B shares are available for trading -- only about 320,000, by Bloomberg’s calculations -- and about three times as many changed hands on Wednesday. The stock, which has been rallying away from the Class A shares all week, touched a record high at $150.72 earlier in the session, a 115% gain at one point. In contrast, Class A shares were little changed at $43.46.It didn’t stop there.Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings Inc. and Liberty Global Plc saw trading in their super voting share classes also halted for upticks in volatility. The common thread?: All of the stocks are low float, super voting shares tied to billionaire John Malone’s empire.Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader and head of markets structure at Bright Trading, said the divergence in the trading of Discovery’s Class B and Class A shares could be an extreme example of what he calls an “arb squeeze,” or a short squeeze involving arbitrage traders.Dick said the moves could be an indication that arbitrage traders were turning to the more thinly traded shares for Discovery after not being able to borrow against the Class A shares.“Maybe some arbs are short one class and long the other, but then the position gets too big and they’re unable to get out, prompting a squeeze on the one class,” Dick said.Liberty Media and Discovery representatives didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.The volatile trading comes after Discovery Class A shares suffered their biggest drop ever on March 26 as the media company was one of the stocks to see a block trade related to the forced liquidation of positions linked to Bill Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management.Discovery Class A shares had previously been among the top performers on the S&P 500 Index this year as the stock rallied on investor optimism for the company’s streaming service, Discovery+.“There is a share class trade involving Discovery, but that concerns the Class A and Class C shares, not the Class B, which generally doesn’t trade as it is almost completely owned by John Malone,” said United First Partners analyst Ivan Deryugin.Just 0.6% of Discovery Class B floating shares were held short as of Wednesday, according to data compiled by financial analytics firm S3 Partners. Short interest as a percentage of the float stood at about 31% in the more liquid Class A shares, roughly in line with where it has stood for much of the past year.Share classes differ in several ways, including voting rights: B shares carry more than the A shares. The issues’ ownership profile is the other main difference. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, cable TV tycoon Malone controls about 94% of the B class -- the reason for the low float.Around 1:40 p.m. in New York, volatility also spread to the B shares for Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings Inc. and Liberty Global Plc. Both were subject to multiple halts after surging as much as 135% and 42%, respectively.A surprise spike in the price of Liberty TripAdvisor and Discovery’s closely held shares isn’t without precedent.Liberty TripAdvisor shares surged 30% in a single day of trading last April and Discovery’s B shares gained 24% on May 1. Back then the two companies put out similar press releases with each saying they were “not aware of the reasons for the recent volatility” in each of the share classes.(Adds details on other Malone related stocks, close prices)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=eb98f39dcb302e41d96f5c5ca19beca78ba9c02ea85ac53a91e7170c33c916e7

The American depositary receipts of Chinese companies also gained, with GSX Techedu Inc. boosted by a planned stock purchase by its chief executive officer, and Vipshop Holdings Ltd. helped by a $500 million buyback proposal.Shares in the companies, which also include Baidu Inc., Farfetch Ltd. and Iqiyi Inc., have had a rocky couple of sessions following the forced liquidation of positions linked to Bill Hwang’s Archegos, with ViacomCBS down 55% in the five trading days through Monday. While investors remain nervous about the potential for more liquidations, there have been no signs yet of a broader contagion. The S&P 500 Index slipped about 0.3%.“Market participants will be glad to see this has so far been contained -- though there may be some more trades related to Archegos that need unwinding,” Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said by email. “Banks left holding the bag -- which look to be Nomura and Credit Suisse more than others -- will suffer significant losses.”Banks roiled by the Archegos Capital fallout may see total losses in the range of $5 billion to $10 billion, according to JPMorgan. Losses from trades unwinding will be “very material” in relation to lending exposure for a business that is mark-to-market and holds liquid collateral, analysts led by Kian Abouhossein wrote in a note.Read more: JPMorgan Says Banks’ Archegos Hit May Be Up to $10 BillionShares in Credit Suisse and Nomura both extended Monday’s steep declines, with the lenders having warned of potential “significant” losses after an unnamed U.S. hedge-fund client defaulted on margin calls.
