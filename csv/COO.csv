(NYSE:COO) is trading at $385.54, after a 3.48% gain. Over the past month, the stock increased by 0.10%, and in the past year, by 22.01%. With performance like this, long-term shareholders optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 2.85%. The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings. View more earnings on COO Depending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others. Cooper Companies Inc. has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 118.58 of the Health Care Equipment & Supplies industry. Ideally, one might believe that the stock might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued. P/E ratio is not always a great indicator of the company's performance. Depending on the earnings makeup of a company, investors can become unable to attain key insights from trailing earnings.

Adjusted EPS is anticipated to range between $12.90 and $13.10, versus analysts’ expectations of $12.54 per share.On Feb. 11, Piper Sandler analyst Matthew O'Brien increased the stock’s price target to $435 (17% upside potential) from $370 and reiterated a Buy rating. The analyst believes that “first half of 2021 estimates may be a little high due to COVID,"" but he remains ""bullish on the story over the next 12 months after speaking to a contact lens distributor.”The consensus rating among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 4 unanimous Buys. The average analyst price target stands at $435 and implies upside potential of about 17% to current levels. Shares have gained more than 14% over the past year.
