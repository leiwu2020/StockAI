company,1616075935,A Look Into Cintas Debt,66868804,,CTAS,Yahoo,"Shares of Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) decreased by 2.54% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Cintas has. Cintas's Debt According to the Cintas's most recent financial statement as reported on January 8, 2021, total debt is at $2.54 billion, with $2.29 billion in long-term debt and $249.87 million in current debt. Adjusting for $703.17 million in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $1.84 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Cintas has $8.45 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.3. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Why Shareholders Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

company,1616054031,Cintas’ Quarterly Results Beat Analysts’ Expectations; Shares Dip,66868811,,CTAS,Yahoo,"Cintas Corporation posted better-than-expected fiscal 3Q (ended Feb. 28) results. However, shares of the business services company dipped 1.4% to close at $343.22 on March 17, as the pandemic and severe weather conditions impacted the top-line results on a year-over-year basis. Cintas (CTAS) reported 3Q earnings of $2.37 per share, up 9.7% on a year-over-year basis, and handily beat the Street estimates of $2.21 per share. Revenue inched down 1.7% to $1.78 billion but topped analysts’ expectations of $1.75 billion. The organic revenue growth rate for the quarter was flat. Additionally, the uniform rental and facility services operating segment also reported flat growth, while first aid and safety services operating segment revenues surged 17.7%. (See Cintas stock analysis on TipRanks) Cintas CEO Scott D. Farmer said, “For our fiscal fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.80 billion to $1.83 billion and diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.40.” “This financial guidance does not include any future share buybacks or additional restrictions on businesses due to increasing COVID-19 case counts,” Farmer added. Oppenheimer analyst Scott Schneeberger reiterated a Hold rating, following the company’s “F3Q21 outperformance.” The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 2 analysts suggesting a Buy and 5 analysts recommending a Hold. The average analyst price target of $361.80 implies 5.4% upside potential to current levels. Shares have rallied almost 93% over the past year.
