The beat was driven by robust performances across all segments and improved credit quality aided by the economic recovery.



The bank reported adjusted earnings of $1.28 per share, beating analysts’ expectations of $1.14 per share. Revenues of $5.78 billion exceeded the consensus estimate of $5.62 billion. (See USB stock charts on TipRanks)



Net interest income came in at $3.16 billion, up 2.4% sequentially due to better yields and volumes in the investment portfolio, while non-interest income grew 10% to $2.6 billion, mainly driven by higher payment services revenue and mortgage banking revenue.



Net interest margin was 2.53% in the quarter, up 3 bps sequentially but down 9 basis points from the year-ago period.



The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $170 million in the quarter while non-interest expenses were up 2.1% year-over-year at $3.4 billion.



The company reported average loans of $294.3 billion, down 7.5% from the prior-year quarter.  However, average deposits surged 6.4% to $429.2 billion.



U.S. Bancorp CEO Andy Cecere commented, “As we head into the second half of 2021, we are well positioned to benefit from improving economic conditions; however, we are even more excited about the significant secular growth opportunities we see driving industry leading returns over the longer term.”



Following the upbeat Q2 results, Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski assigned a Buy rating and the price target of $73 (24.1% upside potential) on the stock.



Kotowski commented, “As elsewhere we think the critical fact is that we are back on a growth footing after a long period of Covid-induced shrink.”



Overall, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 6 Buys and 2 Holds. The average US Bancorp price target of $65.79 implies 11.9% upside potential from current levels. Shares of USB have jumped 56.6% over the past year.

The acquisition will be carried out through U.S. Bancorp Asset Management, a subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp.



The financial terms of the deal, which is likely to close in the fourth quarter of 2021, has been kept under wraps.



Following the news release, shares of the company declined marginally to close at $55.01 in Thursday’s extended trading session.



Post the acquisition, PFM Asset Management will continue to operate as an independent entity. As of March 31, the combined assets under management of the two entities amounted to $325 billion. Notably, PFM’s financial advisory business will not be a part of this deal.



Head of U.S. Bancorp Asset Management Eric Thole said, ""PFM Asset Management brings a wide array of client relationships and product offerings, including local government investment pools, outsourced chief investment officer services and separately managed accounts in both fixed income and multi-asset class strategies. These services complement U.S. Bank’s current book of business, and we’re thrilled to have the opportunity to increase our presence nationally and solidify U.S. Bank’s position as a leading provider of investment solutions."" (See U.S. Bancorp stock chart on TipRanks)



On July 8, RBC Capital analyst Gerard Cassidy reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $62. The analyst’s price target implies upside potential of 12.65% from current levels. 



The Wall Street community is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 7 Buys and 7 Holds. The average U.S. Bancorp price target of $62.73 implies that the stock has upside potential of 14% from current levels. Shares have gained 60.8% over the past year.

Meanwhile, net revenue for the quarter missed analysts’ expectations, impacted by lower net interest and non-interest income. Shares of the bank closed 2.2% lower on April 15. U.S. Bancorp’s (USB) 1Q earnings more than doubled to $1.45 per share, compared to $0.72 reported in the prior-year period, and beat analysts’ expectations of $0.96. Net revenue of $5.47 billion missed the Street’s estimates of $5.53 billion and plunged 5.2% from the year-ago period. Net interest income came in at $3.1 billion, down 4.9% year-over-year due to low interest rates, while non-interest income decreased 5.7% to $2.4 billion, mainly impacted by lower mortgage banking revenue and reduction in securities gains. Net interest margin was 2.50% in the quarter, down 41 basis points. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $827 million in the quarter. Non-interest expenses inched up 1.9% year-over-year to $3.4 billion due to higher compensation and employee benefits expense. (See U.S. Bancorp stock analysis on TipRanks) The company reported average loans of $294 billion, down 1.2% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, average deposits surged 17.5% to $426.4 billion. U.S. Bancorp CEO Andy Cecere said, “Our payments businesses are well-positioned to take advantage of the cyclical recovery and renewed business and consumer activity. In a similar fashion, we will continue to invest in capabilities to create growth, as evidenced by our advances in digital, our alliance with State Farm and our acquisition of talech, an important small business payments capability.” Following the 1Q results, Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski increased the stock’s price target to $72 (27.8% upside potential) from $68 and maintained a Buy rating. Kotowski said, “Our seemingly ambitious $72 price target (up $4 from prior) is based on an 80% relative P/E based on 2022 earnings, and we think the company easily deserves that because of its profitability and track record. If management can get the efficiency ratio back into the low 50s, that would be incremental upside.” Furthermore, “Granted, COVID-19 disruptions and declining rate headwinds have obstructed the quarterly progression of operating leverage and caused a likely minor lapse; however, and we think USB is well poised to continue to outperform and will likely return to its prior trends once trends normalize,” the analyst added. The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 11 Buys versus 6 Holds. The average analyst price target of $60.36 implies 7.2% upside potential to current levels. Shares have surged 77.3% over the past year. U.S. Bancorp scores a 9 of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

The Analyst: J.P. Morgan analyst Vivek Juneja upgraded U.S. Bancorp from Neutral to Overweight and raised his price target from $53 to $60. Juneja also raised price targets of the other seven large cap banks stocks under his coverage: Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC), Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C), Citizens Financial Group Inc (NYSE: CFG) Fifth Third Bancorp (NYSE: FITB), Regions Financial Corp (NYSE: RF), Truist Financial Corp (NYSE: TFC) and Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC). Related Link: BofA Upgrades CME Group, Bank Of NY Mellon On Expectations For Rising Interest Rates The Thesis: In the upgrade note, Juneja said investors should expect extremely strong first-quarter numbers from big banks for two reasons. First, an improving macroeconomic environment likely means banks are releasing their credit reserves. Second, an uptick in spending means higher card-related fees. That potentially sharp uptick in spending is particularly good news for U.S. Bancorp, which Juneja said has the most exposure to sending given card-related fees accounted for about 16% of the company’s total revenue in 2019. View more earnings on USB “Chase card spend data shows that volumes are 12% above 2019 levels recently, inflecting from running below 2019 levels at [the] end of February,” he said. Airlines and hospitality spending accounted for 37% of merchant acquiring volumes and 7% of retail volumes in 2019, Juneja said. Credit card volumes will be particularly important for banks given they have higher fees than debit cards. Juneja said U.S. Bancorp trades at an attractive valuation at just 13.5 times estimated 2022 earnings. He is also bullish on several other big bank stocks heading into the first-quarter earnings season. J.P. Morgan also has Overweight ratings for Bank of America Corp, Citizens Financial Group Inc and Regions Financial Corp. Benzinga’s Take: Bank earnings season kicks off on Wed., April 14 with reports from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) and Wells Fargo & Co. Banks will likely put up some impressive first-quarter numbers, but it remains to be seen just how much earnings upside is already priced into their stock prices after big rallies in bank stocks year-to-date.
