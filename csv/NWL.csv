It also struck up an alliance with investment bank Jarden Securities Ltd. to provide services such as stock and bond underwriting for clients in Australia and New Zealand, it said in separate statements on Monday.Chief Executive Officer Kentaro Okuda is pushing ahead with his global ambitions, just weeks after the Archegos meltdown led to the Japanese firm’s biggest quarterly loss since 2009. At home, Okuda is proceeding with a project inherited from his predecessor to reinvigorate its domestic business serving retail investors, once a stable cash cow.Shake UpIn Japan, Nomura’s venture with The Chiba Bank Ltd., Daishi Hokuetsu Bank Ltd. and Chugoku Bank Ltd. will offer clients remote consultations to help them build assets over the long-term. Nomura plans to take a majority stake in the joint venture, it said.In the alliance with Jarden, the New Zealand bank will bring long-term relationships and expertise, while Nomura will provide its global network, products and balance sheet to support clients across equity capital markets, debt capital markets, and acquisition and leverage finance.That alliance comes amid a shakeup in the investment banking industry in the region as Jarden, along with new firm Barrenjoey, have opened offices in Australia, hiring senior dealmakers from a number of global investment banks.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f4013ba185ebccf088dc6994eb2c5f632b54e1e290a111f19f45a9f6ce674061

This implies upside potential of around 24% from current levels.Commenting before the release of NWL’s results, Grundy told investors that he sees benefits from an improving macro/fundamental turnaround, leading to a better-than-expected Q1 2021 outlook.Consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 2 Buys, 4 Holds and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $23.50 suggests that NWL is fully priced at current levels, with downside potential of around 3% over the next 12 months.Related News:Lincoln Electric Posts Better-Than-Expected Quarterly Profit; Street Sees 5% UpsideBoeing Accused Of Dragging Its Feet In Response To Fatal Air Crashes – ReportNvidia’s Proposed Acquisition Of Arm Under Investigation – Report",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=019f472951fb9064c6548f2fe1bae9f0002ca691e8772cffb1184c683e4dbab0
