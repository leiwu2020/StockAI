The company provides rail-based freight transportation services.



Per the announcement, each shareholder of CSX as of June 18, will receive a stock dividend of 2 additional common shares for every share held. Trading on a split-adjusted basis will begin on June 28.



The move will make the company’s shares accessible to a larger number of employees and investors.



Notably, the stock split will not have any impact on the quarterly cash dividend of $0.28 per share payable on June 15. Based on the current dividend rate, the post-split quarterly dividend will come to $0.093 per share. (See CSX stock analysis on TipRanks)



In its most recent Q1 earnings report, the company reported adjusted earnings of $0.93 per share, which missed analysts’ expectations of $0.95 per share. However, revenue of $2.81 billion surpassed the consensus estimate of $2.78 billion.



Following the earnings announcement, Cowen analyst Jason Seidl maintained a Hold rating and a price target of $98 (1.6% downside potential).



Seidl commented, “CSX is a good company with solid fundamentals that is well positioned to benefit from long-term economic growth. However, we would remain on the sidelines due to less-than-compelling valuation. The shares may be attractive to patient, long-term investors.”



Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 10 Buys versus 3 Holds. The average analyst price target stands at $107.62 and implies upside potential of 8% to current levels. Shares have gained almost 34% over the past year.



CSX Corporation scores an 8 of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

Quality Carriers is a provider of truck transportation for bulk liquid chemicals in North America. The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. CSX expects it to close in Q3. Quality has an extensive fleet of bulk tank trucks and around 2,500 drivers. The acquisition is expected to widen the presence of both companies and create a unique solution for multimodal chemical transport. CSX President and CEO James M. Foote said, “The acquisition of Quality Carriers further demonstrates our commitment to the strategic growth of our business and deepening our relationships with customers.” (See CSX Corp stock analysis on TipRanks) Foote added, “Our new partnership will provide chemical producers and shippers with a first-of-its-kind multimodal solution that capitalizes on the powerful synergies between Quality Carriers’ truck transportation fleet and our cost-advantaged rail network.” On April 21, RBC Capital analyst Walter Spracklin reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $108 (8.4% upside potential) from $100. Spracklin noted CSX’s Q1 performance as “mixed” with earnings “light” compared to estimates. Nonetheless, the analyst continues to favor CSX owing to its robust operating model amongst an increase in volume and related volatility.

(NASDAQ: CSX) today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Quality Carriers, Inc. (""Quality Carriers""), the largest provider of bulk liquid chemicals truck transportation in North America, from Quality Distribution, Inc. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. A leader in bulk chemicals transportation since 1913, Quality Carriers operates the most extensive bulk tank trucking fleet in North America, with around 2,500 drivers. Through a network of over 100 company-owned and affiliate terminals and facilities in key locations throughout the U.S., Canada and Mexico, Quality Carriers provides transportation services to many of the leading chemical producers and shippers in North America. The transaction will create a unique multimodal chemicals transportation solution that will expand the reach of both CSX and Quality Carriers. James M. Foote, president and chief executive officer of CSX said: “The acquisition of Quality Carriers further demonstrates our commitment to the strategic growth of our business and deepening our relationships with customers. Our new partnership will provide chemical producers and shippers with a first-of-its-kind multimodal solution that capitalizes on the powerful synergies between Quality Carriers’ truck transportation fleet and our cost-advantaged rail network. We believe that this new capability will create meaningful long-term value for our company.” Quality Carriers’ management team, led by President Randy Strutz, will continue to lead the business as part of CSX. Mr. Strutz said: “Quality Carriers is excited to become a new and integral part of CSX, which has unparalleled knowledge, experience and presence in the rail-based bulk chemicals transportation space. Together, we will be exceptionally positioned to provide our customers – many of which have existing relationships with both CSX and Quality Carriers – with a unique and seamless rail-to-highway offering. We look forward to partnering with CSX and to create a new level of efficiency for bulk chemicals transportation.” The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory review and certain customary closing conditions.

(NASDAQ: CSX) today announced first quarter 2021 net earnings of $706 million, or $0.93 per share, compared to $770 million, or $1.00 per share in the same period last year. “I am extremely proud of how our team of railroaders handled the challenges presented by the difficult operating conditions this quarter,” said James M. Foote, president and chief executive officer. “Looking forward, the strengthening economic momentum is providing added visibility into volume growth, and we are taking the necessary steps to ensure we are ready to handle these volumes and provide our customers with an industry-leading service product.” Revenue for the first quarter decreased 1 percent from the prior year to $2.81 billion, as intermodal and other revenue growth was more than offset by declines in merchandise, coal, and fuel surcharge revenues. Expenses increased 2 percent year over year to $1.71 billion and operating income declined 7 percent for the quarter to $1.10 billion. CSX executives will conduct a conference call with the investment community this afternoon, April 20, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Investors, media and the public may listen to the conference call by dialing 1-833-968-2260. For callers outside the U.S., dial 1-778-560-2704.

In conjunction with the call, a live webcast will be accessible and presentation materials will be posted on the company's website at http://investors.csx.com. Following the earnings call, a webcast replay of the presentation will be archived on the company website.

(NASDAQ: CSX) confirmed today the closing of the first phase of a comprehensive $525-million rail agreement with the Commonwealth of Virginia. This transaction is part of the Commonwealth’s previously announced multi-billion dollar rail transportation initiative to improve service and infrastructure in the state. “CSX is pleased to close the first phase of this transaction with the Commonwealth of Virginia,” said James M. Foote, president and chief executive officer of CSX. “This transaction highlights our ability to find creative ways to generate meaningful value from our assets while enhancing the safety and efficiency of passenger and freight rail service in a vital transportation corridor. CSX looks forward to our continued partnership with the Commonwealth which will benefit commuters as well as our valued freight customers in the future.” On March 26, 2021, CSX entered into an agreement to sell certain interests in three CSX-owned line segments to the Commonwealth of Virginia for a total of $525 million. This first phase of the agreement is for the conveyance of a permanent land easement to enable the separation of passenger and freight rail operations in the Washington, DC to Petersburg, Va. corridor. The remaining phases of the deal relate to line segments from Petersburg, Va. to Ridgeway, N.C., and from Doswell, Va. to Clifton Forge, Va. CSX anticipates closing on the remaining conveyances over the next two years. About CSX CSX, based in Jacksonville, Florida, is a premier transportation company. It provides rail, intermodal and rail-to-truck transload services and solutions to customers across a broad array of markets, including energy, industrial, construction, agricultural, and consumer products.
