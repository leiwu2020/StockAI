(NASDAQ:ENPH), a global energy management technology company and the world’s leading supplier of microinverter-based solar-plus-storage systems, today announced Palomar Solar, a leading Southern California solar energy installation company, expanded its Enphase Storage business and made valuable contributions to the companies’ long-standing collaboration on home energy technology and new-product testing and feedback. Since 2009, Palomar Solar brought solar energy to more than 3,000 Southern California businesses and homeowners. The company provides full, turn-key solar and energy storage solutions for its customers and manages the city or county permit processing, utility interconnections, and applicable state rebate programs.

(NASDAQ: ENPH), a global energy management technology company and the world’s leading supplier of microinverter-based solar-plus-storage systems, announced today financial results for the first quarter of 2021, which included the summary below from its President and CEO, Badri Kothandaraman. We reported quarterly revenue of $301.8 million in the first quarter of 2021, along with 41.1% for non-GAAP gross margin. We shipped approximately 830 megawatts DC, or 2,452,765 microinverters. In addition, we acquired two companies to accelerate our digital transformation – Sofdesk, Inc., which provides solar design software to installers, and the Solar Design Services business of DIN Engineering Services, LLP, which provides permitting and proposal services to installers. Financial highlights for the first quarter of 2021 are listed below. Revenue of $301.8 millionCash flow from operations of $75.8 million; ending cash balance of $1,489.0 millionGAAP gross margin of 40.7%; non-GAAP gross margin of 41.1%GAAP operating income of $61.4 million; non-GAAP operating income of $80.2 millionGAAP net income of $31.7 million, including a non-cash loss of $56.4 million on the partial settlement of convertible notes; non-GAAP net income of $78.7 millionGAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.22; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.56 Our revenue and earnings for the first quarter of 2021 are provided below, compared with those of the prior quarter and the year ago quarter: (In thousands, except per share data and percentages) GAAP Non-GAAP Q1 2021 Q4 2020 Q1 2020* Q1 2021 Q4 2020 Q1 2020*Revenue$301,754 $264,839 $205,545 $301,754 $264,839 $205,545 Gross margin40.7% 46.0% 39.2% 41.1% 40.2% 39.5%Operating expenses$61,563 $42,824 $35,963 $43,699 $34,193 $28,508 Operating income$61,386 $79,114 $44,712 $80,232 $72,356 $52,773 Net income$31,698 $72,991 $68,936 $78,702 $71,342 $51,875 Basic EPS$0.24 $0.57 $0.56 $0.60 $0.56 $0.42 Diluted EPS$0.22 $0.50 $0.50 $0.56 $0.51 $0.38 * Revenue for the first quarter of 2020 of $205.5 million included approximately $44.5 million of safe harbor revenue. Total revenue increased 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 as we continued to experience strong worldwide demand for our solar and storage systems. We reported record quarterly revenue in the U.S., Europe, and Australia, despite normal seasonality in the first quarter. Our operations team did an excellent job of navigating component supply constraints to best service our customer demand, while improving inventory in the channel. Our non-GAAP gross margin increased to 41.1% in the first quarter of 2021, from 40.2% in the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by disciplined pricing and cost management. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased to $43.7 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $34.2 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to increased investments in research and development, increased hiring, payroll tax associated with employee stock vesting, and the consolidation of Sofdesk operations in late January. Non-GAAP operating income was $80.2 million, compared to $72.4 million in the prior quarter. We exited the first quarter of 2021 with $1,489.0 million in cash and generated $75.8 million in cash flow from operations. The cash balance includes net proceeds of approximately $1,189.4 million from the convertible notes issuance in March 2021 and is partially offset by $304.8 million paid in principal amounts for the partial repurchase and conversions of the convertible notes due 2024 and 2025. Inventory was $34.9 million at the end of the first quarter of 2021, compared to $41.8 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. The sequential decrease in our inventory was driven by an increase in customer demand coupled with supply constraints. We made good progress on the rollout of our Enphase Storage systems by reducing commissioning times. We introduced 24/7 global customer support and are pleased to resume in-person installer training, while also continuing our online certification. In addition, we recently expanded our Enphase Installer Network (EIN) in the Netherlands and Belgium, after successful launches in the U.S. and Australia. Our EIN installers can enjoy a variety of tools and services on Enphase’s digital platform to help make the sales and installation process faster and easier, while providing an exceptional experience to homeowners across the globe.

The refund request was subject to review and approval by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection; therefore, we assessed the probable loss recovery in the three months ended December 31, 2020 was equal to the $16.5 million approved refund requests available to us. For the three months ended December 31, 2020, we have recorded $15.9 million as a reduction to cost of revenues and $0.6 million as interest income in our consolidated statements of operations as the approved refunds relate to paid tariffs previously recorded to cost of revenues. No tariff refunds were recorded as a reduction to cost of revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. (2) Loss on partial settlement of convertible notes of $56.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily relates to the $9.5 million non-cash loss on partial settlement of $87.1 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2024, $9.4 million non-cash loss on partial settlement of $217.7 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2025 and $37.5 million non-cash inducement loss incurred on repurchase of Notes due 2025. Loss on partial settlement of convertible notes of $3.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020 is related to partial settlement of $43.9 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2024. (3) Change in fair value of derivatives of $15.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 represents changes in fair value of the conversion option in the Notes due 2025, as well as the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. Initially, conversion of the Notes due 2025 would be settled solely in cash as a result of the Company not having the necessary number of authorized but unissued shares of its common stock available to settle the conversion option of the Notes due 2025 in shares; therefore, the conversion option, convertible note hedge and warrant transactions were classified as derivatives that required marked-to-market accounting. On May 20, 2020, at the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders, the stockholders approved an amendment to its certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of the Company’s common stock. As a result, the Company is now able to settle the Notes due 2025, convertible notes hedge and warrants through payment or delivery, as the case may be, of cash, shares of its common stock or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election. Accordingly, on May 20, 2020, the conversion option, convertible note hedge and warrant transactions were remeasured at fair value and were then reclassified to additional paid-in-capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheet in the second quarter of 2020 and are no longer remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification.

Click here to see more names for your must-buy list. According to Allied Market Research, the global solar energy market is expected to be worth $223.3 billion by 2026. The sector is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.5%. And solar is no longer a regional phenomenon. Currently, there are over 97 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity installed throughout the country. For perspective, that’s enough to power almost 18 million homes. Source: Diyana Dimitrova / Shutterstock.com The industry has received a boost from federal programs such as the Solar Investment Tax Credit. But there’s also been a drop in the price of the equipment and installation costs that have boosted demand.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips So why didn’t solar stocks move higher until last year? Many solar stocks found themselves fighting deflation of material costs. In fact, if you look at the chart of most solar stocks, they look remarkably similar. All of the major solar companies have faced a selloff to some degree in 2021. One of the leading solar ETFs, the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) is down about 30% from its peak in January. The only question that clean energy investors have to ask is when to jump in? The sector is showing signs of moving higher. But some analysts say the timing may still not be right. However, whenever you decide to jump in, there are several attractive candidates. Many Companies Have a Bright Outlook For example, you could take a lot of the guesswork out and simply invest in an exchange-traded fund. A solid choice would be the Invesco Solar ETF that we mentioned earlier. Another area to pay attention to is the solar panel installers. Here you can look at Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN). The company recently purchased Vivint Solar which brings together the two largest residential solar companies. And turning your attention to the companies that manufacture solar panels and other solar equipment bring to mind names like First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR). In addition to manufacturing solar panels, First Solar is also involved in some of the support and maintenance for solar power operations. Turning your attention north of the border, you can look at Canadian Solar (NASDAQ:CSIQ), which operates in much the same fashion as First Solar, also in Canada. 7 Retail Stocks With E-commerce Locked In SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG) is an Israeli company that makes power optimizers, solar inverters, and monitoring systems that support residential and commercial solar operations. SunPower Corporation (NASDAQ:SPWR) designs and builds photovoltaic cells and related solar materials. And if you’re a speculative investor looking for an under-the-radar gem, you could consider a company such as SolarWindow (OTCMKTS:WNDW). This company uses proprietary technology that they term LiquidElectricity that applies a transparent coating of organic photovoltaic solar cells to solar panels. The stock was trading for under $5 per share just a year ago, but has made significant gains. However, the company does not yet have a product available, so taking a position carries significant risk. But If You Could Only Buy One, It Should Be ENPH Stock My choice would be Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH). And not just because ENPH stock is up about 330% in the last 12 months. The reason is the company’s microinverter technology. While this sounds really technical, it has an easy-to-understand benefit that every solar panel maker will find useful. A fundamental limitation of solar power is what to do in the evening or on cloudy days. Microinverter technology takes the direct current power from the solar panels and converts it to alternating current power. This allows efficient use of solar power during those times. The economics make this a win for customers. And as opposed to central inverters, they make a solar installation less prone to having a single point failure take down the entire system, which makes the company a hit with solar panel installers. And although Enphase does over 80% of its current business in the United States it is looking to expand internationally. One product that has real promise is its off-grid solar and storage system, Ensemble-in-a-Box, which is being targeted for countries like India because it does not require much infrastructure. Overall, ENPH stock is the most compelling solar stock currently on the market.

The first stage of the installation paired 250 x 380 W REA Power Series Modules with Enphase IQ 7+ microinverters to deliver this pioneering 95 kW commercial project. ""The decision to partner with REA Global for our solar requirements was simple as Michael and his team provide the most advanced solar technology and industry-leading workmanship and service,"" said Marc Cleave, head of engineering at Transdev Australia. ""Enphase microinverters were chosen as part of the REA Solar solution to help enable us to generate the most amount of energy for the available rooftop space and provide ultimate system safety and accountability with panel-level monitoring."" ""Being chosen as the key energy partner for Transdev Australia is a great honor and it showcases our commitment to the development and implementation of advanced solar technology,"" said Michael Mrowka, director at REA Global. ""Enphase microinverters are key to this as the technology enables us to create more solar energy from a smaller space with increased safety and reliability."" IQ 7+ microinverters leverage Enphase's unique software-defined architecture and semiconductor integration for excellent reliability and economies of scale. Enphase microinverters are subjected to a rigorous reliability and quality testing regimen with more than one million cumulative hours of power-on testing to provide exceptional performance under heat, high humidity, salty air, extreme cold, and harsh climate conditions. The Company's microinverters are designed to be long-lived energy assets and are backed by a 10-year limited warranty in the Australian solar market, which can be extended for a fee to 15, 20, or 25 years. Reliability and panel-level monitoring were essential requirements to gather the data needed to drive the initiative forward and ensure optimal performance. Both REA Global's residential and commercial installations are outfitted with Enphase Envoy™ communications gateways, which connect the solar systems to the Enphase Enlighten™ monitoring platform and help make per-panel energy monitoring and insights for operations and maintenance easy. ""I am pleased that Transdev has utilized Enphase microinverter technology to shine a light on the electrified future of public transport,"" said Dave Ranhoff, chief commercial officer at Enphase Energy. ""Transdev's vision complements our mission to usher in a new energy future, and it is through the commitment to quality, service, and innovation by partners like REA Global that the clean energy evolution can be realized.""

In recent years, Enphase has introduced online chat support; the Enphase Community platform for direct engagement with other Enphase system owners; Enphase University, an advanced online learning platform; and rapid, remote microinverter activation and returns processing with the Service-on-the-Go tool. “The expansion to 24/7 customer support illustrates that Enphase understands the importance of backing its installers and being there for customers when the grid is not,” said Joe Dazzio, chief operating officer at Efficient Home Services. “We take providing homeowners with the security of back-up power seriously and always-on support for always-on solar-plus-storage technology is simply the right thing to do for our customers.” “As Enphase evolves from being the world’s leading supplier of microinverters to becoming the world’s leading home energy management systems provider, having a support organization with 24/7 availability is essential,” said Arthur Souritzidis, CEO of Momentum Solar. “Our customer base continues to grow due to strong demand, and with offerings like 24/7 support from Enphase we can deliver an exceptional customer experience.” “In just over three years, Enphase has completely changed the game in terms of the kind of customer support installers should expect from a solar and storage technology company,” said Jim Gitas, founder and chief executive officer at Your Energy Solutions. “Home energy security and resilience are vital for all homeowners, and Enphase moving to 24/7 customer support augments our work in ensuring that our customers’ systems are up and running.” “At Enphase, we are turning our customer-first mantra into meaningful actions,” said Jeff McNeil, chief operating officer at Enphase Energy. “Beyond providing always-on support, we are improving our tools, processes, and systems to deliver an outstanding customer experience. Our worldwide customer service Net Promoter Score (NPS) was above 60% in 2020—10 points higher than the 50% NPS score generally considered excellent for consumer goods and services companies*—signaling we are on the right track.” Enphase customer support can be reached through the new self-service center at https://enphase.com/en-us/support or by calling (877) 797-4743, or via the chat service icon on the Enphase website.

(NASDAQ: ENPH), a global energy management technology company and the world’s leading supplier of microinverter-based solar-plus-storage systems, today announced the Company has entered into an agreement with Rubicon Energy to distribute Enphase IQ™ microinverters for grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) applications to residential and commercial installers in the fast-growing South African market. Rubicon Energy, the renewable energy division of Rubicon Group, is headquartered in Cape Town, South Africa with distribution branches located across the country. In order to cater to the higher power modules utilized in the region, Rubicon Energy will predominantly distribute Enphase IQ 7A™ microinverters to residential and commercial installers. Enphase IQ 7A microinverters are grid-tied and compatible with 60-, 66-, or 72-cell solar modules up to 465 W. In addition, all Enphase solar systems distributed by Rubicon Energy will be outfitted with Enphase Envoy™ communications gateways, which connect an Enphase-based solar system to the Enphase Enlighten™ software monitoring platform designed to help make per-panel energy monitoring and insights for operations and maintenance easy. “After careful analysis and testing of its products, Rubicon is excited to include the Enphase product range in our offering,” said Nick Roche, chief product officer at Rubicon Energy. “We have been impressed by all aspects of Enphase and believe it is a great organization with an excellent product offering which is well-suited to the South African solar market requirements. We have found the Enphase microinverter product ecosystem to be refined, easy to install and reliable, all things we know our customers really want. We are very pleased to be partnering with Enphase in South Africa.” “Rubicon strives to introduce new technologies and innovative solutions for the South African PV solar market,” said Greg Blandford, director at Rubicon Energy and E-Mobility. “Enphase has been an innovator with its microinverter technology and has a proven track record for quality and cutting-edge technology. The Enphase microinverter 25-year product limited warranty in South Africa is a testament to this. We are very proud to have partnered with Enphase to introduce its products to South Africa and look forward to building on the company’s global success.” As with all Enphase microinverters, the IQ 7A microinverter is powered by Enphase’s unique software-defined architecture and semiconductor integration for excellent reliability and economies of scale. Enphase microinverters are subjected to a rigorous reliability and quality testing regimen with more than one million cumulative hours of power-on testing to ensure exceptional performance under heat, high humidity, salty air, cold, and harsh climate conditions. ""We are thrilled to be entering one of the fastest-growing renewable energy markets in Africa with a partner like Rubicon Energy,"" said Dave Ranhoff, chief commercial officer at Enphase Energy. “Our companies share a commitment to delivering high-quality products, innovative solutions, and a superior customer experience for grid-tied solar. The African continent represents approximately 40% of the world's solar potential, but it currently produces just 1% of the solar electricity generated globally. Our presence in this region is strategically important as we continue to expand our international business and accelerate the transition to a sustainable and equitable clean energy future by using the world’s smartest and safest technology to electrify homes, businesses, and communities.” About Enphase Energy, Inc. Enphase Energy, a global energy technology company, delivers smart, easy-to-use solutions that manage solar generation, storage and communication on one intelligent platform.
