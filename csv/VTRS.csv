The pharmaceutical company, formed when Pfizer (PFE) merged its Upjohn unit with Mylan NV, started off trading for around $18 per share, but today it changes hands for around $13.46 per share. What is behind Viatris’ decline? Blame it on its disappointing earnings and guidance released in February. For the December quarter, results fell sharply short of expectations, and as for guidance, the company has all but written off 2021. CEO Michael Goettler himself referred to it as Viatris’ “trough year in terms of revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.” In short, the expectation is that this year will be a transitional one for the company. That is bad news for anyone looking at this as a short-term play, but over a longer time frame, there may be a pathway for shares to compensate for their recent losses. Once the company’s multi-year restructuring plan is complete, its annual operating costs could be reduced by $1 billion. This value-add may help fuel an eventual rebound for Viatris shares. Why Investors Have Discarded VTRS Stock Pfizer’s rationale for merging Upjohn with Mylan to create Viatris explains why investors have written it off as a weak opportunity. For years, Upjohn, which comprised Pfizer’s portfolio of older drugs that have gone generic (such as Viagra), was holding down its valuation. By merging the unit with Mylan, with Pfizer shareholders holding more than half of the combined entity, the company was able to divest this unit in a tax efficient way. For years, Mylan has acquired pieces of other pharma companies, with mixed success. However, with a massive restructuring ahead, Mylan (now Viatris) may be able to prove its skeptics wrong, make up for its recent losses, and create additional value for its shareholders. Although Mylan has a poor track record of gaining any added value from its acquisitions, its current plan holds promise. Back in December, Viatris presented its strategy to reduce operating costs by $1 billion per year. This restructuring will be a multi-year process which won’t wrap up until 2024, but the bulk of the upside is projected to be realized within the next two years. Over time, as it reduces its workforce by 20%, and closes, downsizes, or sells 15 of its manufacturing facilities, earnings could come in higher than expected. What Analysts Are Saying About VTRS Stock According to TipRanks’ consensus breakdown, VTRS stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 9 analysts covering the stock, 3 rate it a Buy, 6 analysts rate it a Hold, and 0 analysts rate it a Sell. As for price targets, the average analyst price target on VTRS stock today is $18.29 per share, implying around 35.9% upside potential from today’s prices. Analyst price targets range from a low of $15 per share to a high of $24 per share. (See Viatris stock analysis on TipRanks) TipRanks’ Smart Score According to TipRanks’ Smart Score, which analyzes stocks based on eight factors extracted from our unique datasets, Viatris has a Smart Score of 3, meaning it will likely underperform the broader market. Bottom Line With the multi-year restructuring, Viatris may bounce back from its recent losses and head towards higher price levels, but there is no guarantee this will go off without a hitch. The flip side to the long-term cost savings is short-term restructuring costs. If sales come in lower than expected, while the company is concurrently making big cash outlays to downsize operations, shares could continue to head lower as investors lose more confidence in its prospects. Bottom line: as it remains a “wait and see” situation for most investors, it is going to take some time for the stock to rebound once again. As more investors start to see this as a turnaround play in its early stages, it may start trending in the right direction.

Pfizer separated its off-patent branded drugs business and combined it with Mylan in November. Viatris (NYSE:VTRS) started trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Nov. 13.
So, what is the gameplay with investing in PFE stock?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
PFE Stock Has Deep Value
Trading at a forward price-to-earnings of around 12.5 times, Pfizer trades in deep value territory. The stock spent much of the last half-decade (since 2016) in the $30 to $35 range. Every time the stock rallied above $40, the market would find a reason to sell.
The Viatris spinoff is a positive development. The unit will cut up to 15 manufacturing sites globally and reduce its workforce by up to 20%. By simplifying its business structure, Pfizer has one less worry. Shareholders get 57% of the outstanding shares of Viatris. The unit’s value is independent of Pfizer’s prospects.
Grading 10 of 2020’s Hottest SPACs in Preparation for the New Year
Pfizer may focus on its partnership with BioNTech in the near term. It paid BNTX an upfront payment of $185 million, which includes a $113 million equity investment. And since BNTX stock performed so well in the year, Pfizer at least has paper gains on its balance sheet. After BNTX received approval from regulatory authorities for its novel coronavirus vaccine, it is on the path of getting milestone payments worth $748 million.
The companies stand to bring in around $13 billion in global sales in the next year. This assumes a price of $39 per two-shot course or $19.50 per dose.
Competition for Vaccine
Pfizer and BioNTech face competition from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN). J&J cut the size of its study because of the pervasiveness across the U.S. Investors may interpret the change as benefiting Pfizer-BioNTech. The more subjects a study has, the more durable the results. Still, if J&J’s 38,000 subject count delivers statistically significant results, governments may approve its vaccine, too.
For AstraZeneca, initial confusion over the efficacy of its vaccine may hurt sales. This would benefit Pfizer and BNTX.
Mixed Pfizer’s Third-Quarter Results
Besides its endeavors in the vaccine, Pfizer’s third-quarter results do not inspire investors to accumulate shares. Revenue fell by 4% to $12.131 billion. Net income fell 71% to $2.19 billion, or 39 cents a share. On the conference call, Pfizer’s Chief Financial Officer Frank D’Amelio said he company will use the $12 billion it gets from forming Viatris to pay down debt.
Returning capital to shareholders is a positive development. It will do so without cutting back on its mergers and acquisitions investment. Investors may assume that Pfizer will not cut its research and development activities, either. These activities will nurture its pipeline of potential new drugs ahead. Its mRNA vaccine candidate (with BioNTech) is the most obvious example.
Its Duchenne muscular dystrophin gene therapy product is in Phase 1b. It has an investigational gene therapy for hemophilia A patients. This is a project in partnership with Sangamo. Pfizer announced the first dosage in the Phase 3 AFFINE study on Oct. 7.

Fair Value
Pfizer scores well on all three key metrics:
Pfizer’s stock score is green on all metrics.
Chart courtesy of Stock Rover
Based on those results, the fair value for Pfizer stock is nearly $48. This is above the average price of $41.54 target (as compiled by Tipranks). In a 5Y DCF EBITDA Exit model, readers may assume a terminal EBITDA multiple of below 12 times. With that metric, the stock has a fair value of at least $42.

GA Depot is currently evaluated in a multinational Phase III clinical study and also in an international Phase II for Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS).The on-going Phase III study is a prospective, multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo controlled study designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of GA Depot in subjects with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). A total of 960 subjects are randomized into two groups in this study. During the placebo-controlled portion of the Phase III, subjects receive either 40mg of GA Depot or placebo, via intramuscular injection (IM), once every 4 weeks for a total of 13 doses. Subjects who complete the initial placebo-controlled period are given the option to continue into the open label period for an additional 52 weeks, in which all subjects will receive 40mg of GA Depot IM once every 4 weeks.As the recruitment to the study is progressing ahead of schedule, the Company is currently expanding the study into additional countries, including Israel. The first clinical site in Israel is the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center.Over 60% of the study subjects have been recruited, bringing the total number of patients dosed to over 600. The Multiple Sclerosis International Foundation (MSIF), established by MS neurologists and research experts, published guidelines on October 23, 2020, that glatiramer acetate, unlike other MS therapies, is unlikely to impact negatively on COVID-19 severity.Ehud Marom, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mapi, said, “We very pleased with the recruitment rate into our Phase III study and our expectation now is that Last Patient In (LPI) will occur in the first half of 2021. In the first Data Monitoring Committee review no safety concerns were raised and the Committee (which acts independently) advised that the study should continue without modifications.”The rights to GA Depot for use in RMS have been exclusively licensed to Viatris (formerly Mylan) to commercialize the product.Rajiv Malik, President of Viatris, commented, “Viatris is uniquely positioned to increase access to healthcare and address unmet needs for patients around the world, including those living with MS. We are encouraged by the progress of this trial and in parallel continue to advance commercial operations and supply chain planning in order to bring GA Depot to market at the earliest opportunity. We look forward to expanding our MS portfolio through our strong collaboration with Mapi and increasing access to treatment for those who need it.”About Mapi Pharma  Mapi is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company, engaged in the development of high barrier-to-entry and high added-value life cycle management (“LCM”) products that target large markets and generic drugs that include complex active pharmaceutical ingredients (“APIs”) and formulations.
