Semiconductors are increasingly being used in different applications, including 5G, data centers, Internet of Things (IoT), mobiles and automotive applications.



The semiconductor market is expected to be worth $803.15 billion in 2028, a considerable rise from last year's $425.96 billion, according to a report from Fortune Business Insights. That indicates a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.6% between those two periods.



Using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, let us compare two semiconductor companies,  Qualcomm and Skyworks Solutions, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.







Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM)



Qualcomm reports its revenues under three business segments: Qualcomm CDMA technologies (QCT), Qualcomm technology licensing (QTL), and Qualcomm strategic initiatives (QSI).



QSI is involved in making strategic investments for the company, while the technology licensing business looks at the extensive intellectual property portfolio of the company. The QTL business grants either licenses or rights to use parts of this portfolio, especially in the use or sale of wireless products.



The QCT business develops and supplies integrated circuits (ICs) and system software that are based on technologies like 3G, 4G and 5G, which can be used in a wide array of applications. Those include mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, wireless networks and automotive systems for infotainment and telematics.



Qualcomm is expected to report its fiscal Q3 earnings on July 28.



A couple of days back, Microsoft (MSFT) announced its first update to Windows in 6 years, Windows 11. The company also announced it will be partnering with Qualcomm for QCOM’s ARM-based processor for Windows 11.



Following the announcement from Microsoft, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kevin Cassidy reiterated a Buy with a price target of $180 (30.76% upside) on QCOM stock. Cassidy viewed the MSFT announcement as positive for QCOM stock.



The analyst stated, “We see Windows 11 as the breakthrough Qualcomm has needed to make strategic inroads into the PC market.”



QCOM had said at its Q2 earnings call that it expects the handset and RF-front end market to be worth $10 billion, and the company is likely to benefit from this industry from the next fiscal year. The company’s $1.4 billion acquisition of NUVIA in the second quarter is expected to further bolster its growth when it comes to high-performance processors. (See Qualcomm stock chart on TipRanks)



Cassidy believes that over the long term, the company “should have samples of its first Nuvia custom ARM CPU- based SoCs [system-on-a-chip] in late 2022 with production in ~2H2023.”



“We see Qualcomm's Snapdragon SoC with integrated camera control, WiFi, and BlueTooth while using only ~10W of power as compelling for all day PC battery life,” the analyst added.



Qualcomm’s Snapdragon SOC and Nuvia ARM SOCs could provide plenty of potential for performance upgrade over the long term, according to Cassidy. The analyst also said that since QCOM’s SOCs platforms provide full 5G connectivity, it could expand the PC’s capability to function as a communications device.



In the second quarter, QCOM posted revenues of $7.9 billion, up 52% year-on-year with diluted EPS of $1.53 per share, which is up a whopping 273% year-on-year.



QCOM has forecast revenues between $7.1 billion and $7.9 billion in the third quarter, while non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the $1.55 to $1.75 range. In Q3, the QCT business segment is expected to generate revenues between $5.8 billion and $6.3 billion, while the QTL segment is expected to post revenues of $1.35 billion to $1.55 billion.



Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 9 Buys, 6 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average Qualcomm price target of $171.08 indicates upside potential of around 24.3% from current levels.







Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS)



Skyworks Solutions provides analog semiconductors. Its extensive product portfolio includes amplifiers, voltage regulators, voltage-controlled oscillators and wireless ASoC.



Last week, the company announced that along with Xilinx (XLNX), SWKS has enabled 5G across the C-Band spectrum. SWKS, in partnership with Xilinx, showed compliance with 3GPP linearity and bandwidth requirements for C-Band signals that are important for enabling 5G infrastructure.



According to Skyworks, C-Band spectrum in the United States refers to mid-band frequencies ranging between 3.7 Gigahertz (Ghz) to 3.98 Ghz that are “optimal for 5G because they provide the right balance of geographic coverage, capacity and speed.”



Yusuf Jamal, SVP and GM of diversified analog and AI solutions at Skyworks said, “Our demo with Xilinx highlights the readiness and maturity of this 5G solution and with the C-band auction concluded and winners announced, the next phase is for deployments as rapidly as possible.”



“The C-band is a unique and important piece of the 5G landscape, and Skyworks has long been investing in and preparing to deliver innovative technologies that address this new spectrum,” Jamal added.



5G is perceived by analysts as the next big revenue-generating stream for Skyworks. Late last month, analyst Edward Snyder from Charter Equity reiterated a Buy on the stock. With the rollout of 5G in the United States, the analyst stated that mid-tier phones using discrete radio frequency front-end equipment (RFFE) won’t work for 5G.



This is due to complex signal routing and “RF performance requirements too arduous to be realized by designs that pass RF signal in and out of dozens of individually packaged components,” Snyder added.



However, the analyst added that as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) convert more of mid-tier phones to 5G using module RFFEs, companies like SWKS could benefit.



Snyder said, ""So while 5G may not yield much of an ARPU [average revenue per user] increase for carriers or big orders for base station vendors, it should continue generating revenue growth for Qorvo and Skyworks, the only two RF component manufacturers capable of fielding high-performance modules to the mid-tier market.”



The company posted fiscal Q2 revenues of $1.172 billion, a jump of 53% year-on-year that came in ahead of analysts’ estimate of $1.15 billion. SWKS reported non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.37 per share versus the consensus estimate of $2.35. (See Skyworks Solutions stock chart on TipRanks)



In Q3, SWKS anticipates revenues to grow 49% year-on-year to the midpoint of its range of $1.075 billion to $1.125 billion and as a result, expects non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.13, a rise of 70% year-on-year.



Last month, Skyworks closed its $1.5 billion senior note offering and intends to use the net proceeds of the offering to finance the $2.75 billion acquisition of the infrastructure and automotive business of Silicon Labs.



Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 11 Buys and 6 Holds. The average Skyworks price target of $213.60 indicates upside potential of around 19.5% from current levels.







Bottomline



It seems that both QCOM and SWKS are targeting the rollout of 5G in the U.S. with their products and equipment. MSFT’s partnership with QCOM for its ARM based processor for Windows 11 is a definite plus for the company.



While analysts are cautiously optimistic about both stocks, based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, QCOM seems to be a better Buy.

(SWKS) announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with Silicon Laboratories, Inc. (SLAB), under which Skyworks will acquire the infrastructure and automotive business of Silicon Labs for $2.75 billion. Skyworks is already one of the leading chip suppliers to smartphone manufacturers including Apple, Inc. (AAPL). The acquisition of this business line will not only help Skyworks gain market share in the fast-growing mobile networks industry, but will also help the company venture into the EV (electric vehicle) space. The transaction will be funded with both cash and debt financing arranged by J.P. Morgan. The deal is expected to be finalized in the third quarter of this year and will be immediately accretive to company earnings. Opening New Doors For Skyworks Skyworks has a strong business relationship with Apple, which has been a key ingredient in the chipmaker’s recent success. Apple accounted for 56% of revenue generated by Skyworks in Fiscal 2020, a fact that also highlights the customer concentration risk faced by the company. If Apple were to switch to another vendor of radio frequency content for its latest iPhone models, Skyworks would find it difficult to break even, let alone be profitable. Acquiring a business unit from Silicon Labs will help Skyworks diversify its revenue sources. In addition, the automotive semiconductor market is one of the fastest-growing segments of the semiconductor industry, due to the increasing demand for advanced chips from both legacy and new-age automakers. This demand is driven by the high number of chips used to power EVs. According to data from EV-volumes, just over 3.2 million EVs were sold globally in 2020. Deloitte projects annual registration of EVs to increase to 31.1 million by 2030, accounting for approximately a third of total vehicle sales in the world. To achieve this ambitious goal, automakers are constantly trying to enhance the technology used in EVs to improve battery range. Skyworks, with the acquisition of the automotive portfolio from Silicon Labs, will be well-positioned to support automakers by designing the high-end chips needed for those technologies. Its expected penetration of the automotive semiconductor industry will help Skyworks diversify its revenue sources meaningfully. That shift will likely expand the valuation multiples at which the stock is trading in the market. Earnings Recap The chip manufacturer reported earnings per share of $2.37 for the March quarter (fiscal second quarter), narrowly beating the Wall Street consensus estimate of $2.35. The reported revenue of $1.17 billion for the quarter reflected a year-over-year increase of 52.7%. Those numbers confirm that Skyworks is continuing to benefit from favorable macroeconomic conditions, specifically the strong demand for 5G-enabled smartphones. (See Skyworks stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the release of March quarter earnings, Skyworks’ stock fell more than 7%. It is likely that investors were expecting a larger earnings surprise due to the strong performance of iPhone 12 models since their release late last year. Wall Street Weighs In Immediately following the release of fiscal second-quarter earnings, Raymond James analyst Chris Caso raised the price target for Skyworks from $205 to $220, citing expected iPhone unit growth. Meanwhile, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh followed the same path by raising the price target for Skyworks from $207 to $210, explaining that the rollout of 5G will lead to strong sales for mobile chips manufactured by the company. Turning to the rest of the Street, analysts have an average analyst price target of $211.81 for Skyworks shares, which implies an upside potential of 21% from the market price of around $175 on May 7. Additionally, its Moderate Buy consensus rating breaks down into 11 Buys and 7 Holds. Takeaway Skyworks Solutions has reached a definitive agreement with Silicon Labs to acquire Silicon’s infrastructure and automotive portfolio. This transaction is expected to help Skyworks gain market share in the automotive semiconductor industry. The company does not have any long-term debt on its balance sheet. Together, the strong liquidity position of the company and the prospects for the semiconductor industry paint a highly promising picture. Overall, the company seems to be deeply undervalued in the market, presenting an opportunity to investors.

The analog semiconductor company reported non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.37 per share versus consensus estimate of $2.35. President and CEO of Skyworks Solutions, Liam K. Griffin said, “Skyworks’ record second quarter results reflect sustained leadership across a rapidly expanding set of end markets and customers, supported by our cutting-edge technologies and world-class manufacturing facilities. Importantly, our broad markets portfolio continues to gain momentum, with strong sequential and year-over-year growth.” “Moving forward, our core business combined with our pending acquisition of the Infrastructure and Automotive business of Silicon Labs position Skyworks to capture an outsized portion of the opportunities that lie ahead,” Griffin added. In the fiscal third quarter, SWKS anticipates revenues to grow 49% year-on-year to the midpoint of its range of $1.075 billion to $1.125 billion and as a result, expects non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.13, a rise of 70% year-on-year. The company also declared a cash dividend of $0.50 per share of common stock, payable on June 8 to shareholders of record as on May 18. (See Skyworks Solutions stock analysis on TipRanks) Shares of SWKS have dropped 5% in the past five days. Following the earnings, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland reiterated a Hold and a price target of $190 on the stock. This implies almost 5% upside potential over the next 12 months. Rolland noted, “After one of the greatest semis beats in recent memory last quarter (Dec), admittedly this modest beat and raise almost looks like a miss in contrast. But we note the company still posted more than +50% growth year-over-year, and remains “in the ballpark” for similar full-year growth.” “While not totally immune to supply constraints, as the company does rely on some third parties for parts of their supply chain, the company is faring better than most as they do much of their own production in-house. In short, we believe Skyworks offers one of the best 5G stories in semis, but remain Neutral as we wait for a better entry and valuation,” Rolland added. Overall, consensus among analysts is that SWKS is a Moderate Buy based on 11 Buys and 6 Holds. The average analyst price target of $213.13 implies upside potential of about 17.5% from current levels.

Shares of Silicon Laboratories (SLAB) shot up 12.3% after-hours on the news of the acquisition. Skyworks Solutions’ (SWKS) President and CEO, Liam K. Griffin said, “We are pleased to welcome the Infrastructure & Automotive team to Skyworks when this transaction is completed. This acquisition will broadly expand our capabilities across high-growth end markets including automotive, communications and industrial, creating new and highly compelling opportunities for Skyworks.” “By leveraging our global sales channels, operational scale and deep customer relationships, Skyworks is well positioned to drive above-market growth, while diversifying revenues, expanding margins and delivering strong returns in earnings and cash generation,” Griffin added. The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to SWKS and is anticipated to close in the third quarter of this year. SWKS believes that Silicon Labs’ technology portfolios and related assets will be “highly complementary” to its connectivity portfolio. With this acquisition, SWKS also expects to expand rapidly into different business segments including electric and hybrid vehicles, 5G wireless infrastructure, power supply, industrial and motor control, and optical data communication. This acquisition will enable SWKS to provide products to a market worth $20 billion annually. (See Skyworks Solutions stock analysis on TipRanks) As a part of this acquisition, Mark Thompson, SVP of Silicon Labs and general manager of the Infrastructure & Automotive business, will join Skyworks and report directly to Skyworks’ CEO, Liam K. Griffin. Following the acquisition announcement, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated a Buy and a price target of $207 on the stock. Rakesh said, “We see SWKS’s acquisition as a positive diversification opportunity into adjacent industrial & automotive markets with operational synergy potential, and a shift away from Mobile should be a positive as SWKS noted its top 10 customers would account for 30% of revenues with 4,000 customers making up the remaining 70%.” Overall, consensus among Wall Street analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 12 Buys and 7 Holds. The average analyst price target of $208.25 implies upside potential of about 13.5% to current levels.
