Conference Call Information To discuss Regency’s first quarter results and provide further business updates, management will host a conference call on Friday, May 7, 2021, at 11:00 a.m. ET. Dial-in and webcast information is listed below. First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference CallDate:Friday, May 7, 2021Time:11:00 a.m. ETDial#:877-407-0789 or 201-689-8562Webcast:investors.regencycenters.com Replay Webcast Archive: Investor Relations page under Events & Webcasts Non-GAAP Disclosure We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to our Board of Directors, management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting, forecasting and planning purposes. We do not consider non-GAAP measures an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they may exclude significant expense and income items that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, they reflect the exercise of management’s judgment about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures we use to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon in evaluating the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of the Company. Nareit FFO is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains on sale and impairments of real estate, net of tax, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Regency computes Nareit FFO for all periods presented in accordance with Nareit's definition. Since Nareit FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and gains on sales and impairments of real estate, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in percent leased, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs. This provides a perspective of the Company’s financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Thus, Nareit FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of the Company's operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP; and, therefore, should not be considered a substitute measure of cash flows from operations. The Company provides a reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders to Nareit FFO. Core Operating Earnings is an additional performance measure that excludes from Nareit FFO: (i) transaction related income or expenses; (ii) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt; (iii) certain non-cash components of earnings derived from above and below market rent amortization, straight-line rents, and amortization of mark-to-market of debt adjustments; and (iv) other amounts as they occur.

Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements in this document regarding anticipated financial, business, legal or other outcomes including business and market conditions, outlook and other similar statements relating to Regency’s future events, developments, or financial or operational performance or results such as our 2021 Guidance, are “forward-looking statements” made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are identified by the use of words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “estimate,” “believe,” “intend,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “guidance,” and other similar language. However, the absence of these or similar words or expressions does not mean a statement is not forward-looking. While we believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable when made, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and undue reliance should not be placed on these statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance these expectations will be attained, and it is possible actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Our operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those risk factors described in our SEC filings. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our other filings and submissions to the SEC. If any of the events described in the risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected. Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are made, and Regency undertakes no duty to update its forward-looking statements except as required by law. These risks and events include, without limitation: Risk Factors Risk Factors Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic Pandemics or other health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect our tenants’ financial condition, the profitability of our properties, and our access to the capital markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Risk Factors Related to Operating Retail-Based Shopping Centers Economic and market conditions may adversely affect the retail industry and consequently reduce our revenues and cash flow, and increase our operating expenses. Shifts in retail trends, sales, and delivery methods between brick and mortar stores, e-commerce, home delivery, and curbside pick-up may adversely impact our revenues and cash flows. Changing economic and retail market conditions in geographic areas where our properties are concentrated may reduce our revenues and cash flow. Our success depends on the continued presence and success of our “anchor” tenants. A significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller “shop space” tenants and our net income may be adversely impacted if our smaller shop tenants are not successful. We may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy. Many of our costs and expenses associated with operating our properties may remain constant or increase, even if our lease income decreases. Compliance with the Americans with the Disabilities Act and fire, safety and other regulations may have a negative effect on us. Risk Factors Related to Real Estate Investments Our real estate assets may decline in value and be subject to impairment losses which may reduce our net income. We face risks associated with development, redevelopment and expansion of properties. We face risks associated with the development of mixed-use commercial properties. We face risks associated with the acquisition of properties. We may be unable to sell properties when desired because of market conditions. Changes in tax laws could impact our acquisition or disposition of real estate. Risk Factors Related to the Environment Affecting Our Properties Climate change may adversely impact our properties directly, and may lead to additional compliance obligations and costs as well as additional taxes and fees. Geographic concentration of our properties makes our business more vulnerable to natural disasters, severe weather conditions and climate change. Costs of environmental remediation may impact our financial performance and reduce our cash flow. Risk Factors Related to Corporate Matters An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance coverage on our properties may subject us to loss of capital and revenue on those properties. Failure to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our business and operations. The unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of tenant or employee personal, financial or other data or of Regency’s proprietary or confidential information stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues. Risk Factors Related to Our Partnerships and Joint Ventures We do not have voting control over all of the properties owned in our co-investment partnerships and joint ventures, so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued. The termination of our partnerships may adversely affect our cash flow, operating results, and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders. Risk Factors Related to Funding Strategies and Capital Structure Our ability to sell properties and fund acquisitions and developments may be adversely impacted by higher market capitalization rates and lower NOI at our properties which may dilute earnings. We depend on external sources of capital, which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all. Our debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition. Covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition. Increases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations. Hedging activity may expose us to risks, including the risks that a counterparty will not perform and that the hedge will not yield the economic benefits we anticipate, which may adversely affect us. The interest rates on our Unsecured Credit facilities as well as on our variable rate mortgages and interest rate swaps might change based on changes to the method in which LIBOR or its replacement rate is determined. Risk Factors Related to the Market Price for Our Securities Changes in economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our securities. There is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates. Risk Factors Relating to the Company’s Qualification as a REIT If the Parent Company fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Dividends paid by REITs generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates. Certain foreign stockholders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if we do not qualify as a “domestically controlled” REIT. Legislative or other actions affecting REITs may have a negative effect on us. Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities. Risks Related to the Company’s Common Stock Restrictions on the ownership of the Parent Company’s capital stock to preserve its REIT status may delay or prevent a change in control. The issuance of the Parent Company's capital stock may delay or prevent a change in control. Ownership in the Parent Company may be diluted in the future.

An annual facility fee of 15 basis points, subject to the Company’s credit ratings, applies to the entire $1.25 billion Facility. •To further Regency’s environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) sustainability initiatives, the Company’s lenders have agreed that the margin for purposes of determining the interest rate on the Facility may be reduced by an additional 0.01% if, as of any fiscal year, a sustainability metric related to reduction in greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions is achieved. •The Facility is held by 13 U.S. and International banks.

Please refer to the fourth quarter 2020 Supplemental package for a complete list of guidance assumptions. “While we are gratified to return to more customary guidance practices as transparency remains a key tenet of our values, we believe a wide range of potential outcomes is prudent given the uncertainty that remains in our operating environment,” said Mike Mas, EVP and Chief Financial Officer. “The potential outcomes can best be described as three independent scenarios, which each could result in different and distinct impacts to our Net Operating Income.” •The lower end of our guidance range is based on a “reverse course” scenario, which assumes more shutdowns and increased restrictions, leading to a decline in rent collection rates. •The midpoint area of our range is based on a “status quo” scenario, which assumes a continuation of our fourth quarter 2020 same-property NOI and collection rates. •The higher end of our range is based on a “continued improvement” scenario, which assumes further lifting of restrictions and added federal stimulus, leading to increases in collection rates. Please refer to the Company’s “Business Update” presentation for additional guidance details, including a reconciliation of Nareit FFO per diluted share from 2020 to 2021, posted on the website at investors.regencycenters.com.

Dial-in and webcast information is listed below. Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference CallDate:Friday, February 12, 2021Time:12:00 p.m. ETDial#:877-407-0789 or 201-689-8562Webcast:investors.regencycenters.com Replay Webcast Archive: Investor Relations page under Events & Webcasts Non-GAAP Disclosure We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to our Board of Directors, management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting, forecasting and planning purposes. We do not consider non-GAAP measures an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they may exclude significant expense and income items that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, they reflect the exercise of management’s judgment about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures we use to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon in evaluating the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of the Company. Nareit FFO is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains on sale and impairments of real estate, net of tax, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Regency computes Nareit FFO for all periods presented in accordance with Nareit's definition. Since Nareit FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and gains on sales and impairments of real estate, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in percent leased, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs. This provides a perspective of the Company’s financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Thus, Nareit FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of the Company's operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP; and, therefore, should not be considered a substitute measure of cash flows from operations. The Company provides a reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders to Nareit FFO. Core Operating Earnings is an additional performance measure that excludes from Nareit FFO: (i) transaction related income or expenses; (ii) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt; (iii) certain non-cash components of earnings derived from above and below market rent amortization, straight-line rents, and amortization of mark-to-market of debt adjustments; and (iv) other amounts as they occur.

Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements in this document regarding anticipated financial, business, legal or other outcomes including business and market conditions, outlook and other similar statements relating to Regency’s future events, developments, or financial or operational performance or results such as our 2021 Guidance, are “forward-looking statements” made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are identified by the use of words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “estimate,” “believe,” “intend,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “guidance,” and other similar language. However, the absence of these or similar words or expressions does not mean a statement is not forward-looking. While we believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable when made, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and undue reliance should not be placed on these statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance these expectations will be attained, and it is possible actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Our operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those risk factors described in our SEC filings. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our other filings and submissions to the SEC. If any of the events described in the risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected. Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are made, and Regency undertakes no duty to update its forward-looking statements except as required by law. These risks and events include, without limitation: Risk Factors Risk Factors Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic Pandemics or other health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect our tenants’ financial condition, the profitability of our properties, and our access to the capital markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Risk Factors Related to Operating Retail-Based Shopping Centers Economic and market conditions may adversely affect the retail industry and consequently reduce our revenues and cash flow, and increase our operating expenses. Shifts in retail trends, sales, and delivery methods between brick and mortar stores, e-commerce, home delivery, and curbside pick-up may adversely impact our revenues and cash flows. Changing economic and retail market conditions in geographic areas where our properties are concentrated may reduce our revenues and cash flow. Our success depends on the continued presence and success of our “anchor” tenants. A significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller “shop space” tenants and our net income may be adversely impacted if our smaller shop tenants are not successful. We may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy. Many of our costs and expenses associated with operating our properties may remain constant or increase, even if our lease income decreases. Compliance with the Americans with the Disabilities Act and fire, safety and other regulations may have a negative effect on us. Risk Factors Related to Real Estate Investments Our real estate assets may decline in value and be subject to impairment losses which may reduce our net income. We face risks associated with development, redevelopment and expansion of properties. We face risks associated with the development of mixed-use commercial properties. We face risks associated with the acquisition of properties. We may be unable to sell properties when desired because of market conditions. Changes in tax laws could impact our acquisition or disposition of real estate. Risk Factors Related to the Environment Affecting Our Properties Climate change may adversely impact our properties directly, and may lead to additional compliance obligations and costs as well as additional taxes and fees. Geographic concentration of our properties makes our business more vulnerable to natural disasters, severe weather conditions and climate change. Costs of environmental remediation may impact our financial performance and reduce our cash flow. Risk Factors Related to Corporate Matters An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance coverage on our properties may subject us to loss of capital and revenue on those properties. Failure to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our business and operations. The unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of tenant or employee personal, financial or other data or of Regency’s proprietary or confidential information stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues. Risk Factors Related to Our Partnerships and Joint Ventures We do not have voting control over all of the properties owned in our co-investment partnerships and joint ventures, so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued. The termination of our partnerships may adversely affect our cash flow, operating results, and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders. Risk Factors Related to Funding Strategies and Capital Structure Our ability to sell properties and fund acquisitions and developments may be adversely impacted by higher market capitalization rates and lower NOI at our properties which may dilute earnings. We depend on external sources of capital, which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all. Our debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition. Covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition. Increases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations. Hedging activity may expose us to risks, including the risks that a counterparty will not perform and that the hedge will not yield the economic benefits we anticipate, which may adversely affect us. The interest rates on our Unsecured Credit facilities as well as on our variable rate mortgages and interest rate swaps might change based on changes to the method in which LIBOR or its replacement rate is determined. Risk Factors Related to the Market Price for Our Securities Changes in economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our securities. There is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates. Risk Factors Relating to the Company’s Qualification as a REIT If the Parent Company fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Dividends paid by REITs generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates. Certain foreign stockholders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if we do not qualify as a “domestically controlled” REIT. Legislative or other actions affecting REITs may have a negative effect on us. Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities. Risks Related to the Company’s Common Stock Restrictions on the ownership of the Parent Company’s capital stock to preserve its REIT status may delay or prevent a change in control.

Last month, several Wall Street analysts turned bullish on high-yielding dividend stocks – recommending defensive plays even as the market was trending strongly upwards. And... then we had the short-squeeze frenzy to finish off January, leading to the worst month for the major stock indexes since October. The market’s current conditions remain bullish overall, but the events of the past 10 days have reminded us all of the value in keeping a defensive segment to the portfolio. Against this backdrop, we've used the TipRanks database to pinpoint three high-yield dividend stocks that all share some important features; They are paying out reliable dividends with upwards of 5% yield. And, in each case, at least one of Wall Street’s analysts has turned bullish (i.e. upgraded the stock). Given that analysts usually reiterate recommendations, upgrades are a clear sign of increasing confidence in a company’s outlook. Regency Centers Corporation (REG) We will start with Regency Centers, a Florida-based real estate investment trust (REIT). There is no surprise finding a REIT in a list of high-yielding dividend stocks; these companies are required by tax code compliance to return a high percentage of profits to their shareholders, and frequently use dividends as the vehicle. Regency holds a diverse portfolio of desirable retail locations, 408 in total across 30 states, with 56 million square feet of leasable space. Even with the decline in brick-and-mortar retail due to the ongoing corona crisis, this portfolio has proven to be a continuing asset. The spaces are mainly shopping centers, located in affluent urban areas, and anchored by reliable, chain grocery stores. In the third quarter of 2020, the last with numbers available, the company reported that its properties had a 93.4% occupancy rate, and that 98% of rents due were collected. From this, the company reported an EPS of 7 cents per share. While positive, this represents a serious year-over-year decline, mainly attributable to pandemic-related causes. Even though income is down, Regency has maintained its dividend during the health crisis. The company’s most recent payment, which went out in early January, was for 59.5 cents per share – the same as the previous three quarters. Regency has a pattern of raising the dividend for the Q1 distribution, and has a 12-year history of reliable dividend growth. The 2020 dividends annualized to $2.38 and gives a yield of 5.07%. Covering the stock from Compass Point, analyst Floris van Dijkum writes, “[REG] fully covered its 2020 dividend, based on our estimates, and is expected to retain approximately $75 million of cash post dividend in 2021… REG shares appear [to be a] value at the moment. REG trades at a 20% discount to NAV, wider than sector peers… On an implied cap rate spread, REG trades at 1.1% over its warranted cap rate of 5.5%... We recommend that investors capture this relative valuation spread… by swapping exposure into REG.” Showing the extent of his bullishness, van Dijkum upgraded his stance of REG to a Buy, and raised his price target to $54. At current levels, his target implies a one-year upside of 15%. So, that’s Compass Point's view, let’s turn our attention now to rest of the Street: REG's 4 Buys, 1 Hold and 1 Sell coalesce into a Moderate Buy rating. Meanwhile, the average price target stands at $50.75 and implies an 8% upside from the current levels. (See REG stock analysis on TipRanks) Vornado Realty (VNO) Next up, Vornado, is another REIT, with its headquarters in New York City. The company is known for its ownership of high-brow locations in the city, including the Crowne Plaza Hotel and One Penn Plaza. In addition to the properties of which it is full owner, Vornado is also 70% owner of 1260 Avenue of the Americas and San Francisco’s 555 California Street; in each of these cases, the remaining 30% is connected to former President Trump. Those last-named properties are widely viewed as trophy assets, and were up for sale earlier in 2020. They were pulled from the market as the ‘corona recession’ deepened – and high-end real estate became something of a white whale. Both buildings remain valuable, however, in the range of $5 billion. Vornado is expected to either locate new tenants, or resume efforts to sell, later this year. Vornado’s financials fell off sharply in 2020, when the corona crisis hit, but earnings turned positive in Q3. The company reported $53.2 million in net income attributable to common shareholders, or 28 cents per share, which was up from a net loss of $1.04 per share in Q2. The company attributes the year-over-year declines to building closures and lower rent collections due to the ongoing pandemic – but notes that financial results should improve as the city’s economic reopening accelerates. Vornado was forced to reduce its dividend starting in Q3 2020, from 66 cents per common share to 53 cents, but it has maintained the payment since then. The next payout has been declared for February 12. At the current rate, the dividend annualizes to $2.12 and yields a 5.5%. Truist analyst Michael Lewis covers VNO, and he sees the company’s potentialities opening up again now that 2020 is behind us. “We like it better going into 2021 after earnings washed out in 2020… we think the narrative during the back half of this year will be reopening New York and getting it on a pathway to recovery after vaccine distribution,” the analyst noted. Turning to specific buildings, and the income they generate, Lewis wrote, “PENN1 and PENN2 are expected to gradually contribute to growth from 2022-2024 – and the success of 220 Central Park condo sales means the funding is already raised and is sitting in wait to earn a return.” In line with his upbeat outlook, Lewis upgraded VNO from Hold to Buy, and bumped his price target up to $46, implying 24% upside for the coming 12 months. Looking at the consensus breakdown, analysts are split right down the middle when it comes to VNO. 2 Buys, 2 Holds and 2 Sells add up to a Hold consensus rating. Additionally, the $40.80 average price target implies ~10% upside from current levels. (See Vornado Realty stock) Chevron Corporation (CVX) From REITs, we’ll move over to the oil industry. This is another area rich with dividend potential, as Big Petroleum never lacks for customers, when facing headwinds. Those headwinds, in the past year, have included lower demand and lower prices during the COVID-19 recession – but as the coronavirus recedes, vaccines roll out in greater availability, and economies reopen, the price of oil has been rising. Since the end of October, WTI has gained 55% while Brent is up 54%. The gain in oil prices can’t come at a better time for Chevron, whose operations include, among other concerns, 11,000 oil wells in the Texas Permian Basin, Australia’s $43 billion Gorgon Gas Project, and a 40% interest in 13 of Nigeria’s Niger Delta oil concessions. In 2H20, the company’s revenues rebounded from sharp declines in Q2, reaching $23.9 billion in Q3 and $24.8 billion in Q4. Earnings per share are still negative, but are trending back upward. Many oil companies cut back on dividend payments in 2020 – but not Chevron. The oil giant has a 12-year history of keeping up its payments to shareholders, and kept its common share dividend at $1.29 per share through the difficult year. Last month, the company announced its first common-share dividend payment of CY21, also at $1.29. At that rate, the annual payout is $5.16 per share and the yield is 5.9%. To this end, analyst Paul Cheng, of Canada’s Scotiabank, saw fit to upgrade CVX’s rating from Neutral to Outperform (i.e. Buy), while raising the price target to $110 (from $95). This figure suggest a 23% upside from current levels. “As a result of the shares’ recent sharp underperformance, we think the company’s relative valuation has become compelling. While we don’t think CVX will perform as well as some of the large cap E&Ps… we think they will be a solid outperformer among the super majors and a good long-term holding with a solid management team focused on their cash return business model,” Cheng commented. Overall, Wall Street appears to be sanguine about Big Oil. CVX has 14 recent reviews, breaking down 10 to 4 in favor of the Buys and making the analyst consensus rating a Moderate Buy. The shares are priced at $89 and the $105.08 average price target suggests the stock has room for ~18% growth this year.
