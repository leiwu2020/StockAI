While there is bipartisan agreement on confronting China’s rising challenge to American economic primacy, Republicans and Democrats are still wrangling over the details.The legislation would set up a program to give financial assistance to build, expand, or modernize semiconductor fabrication plants in the U.S. Although specific companies aren’t targeted for the aid, Sanders said five semiconductor companies likely would get the lion’s share.His proposed amendment, which was reported earlier by the New York Times, is one of several that are expected to be introduced this week in the Senate. Debating and voting on those changes risks Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s goal of finishing the legislation before the chamber goes on break at the end of the week.Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said the China bill “is incomplete” without dealing with some of the changes wanted by members of both parties.“We should not close debate on this bill until those amendments are addressed,” he said on the Senate floor.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c93bc8cf8ec3072f76b39b2a084304bb677bd903a09dc7ac783455c83d6a91f1

For months, shares in the major semiconductor company trended higher, fueled by the tailwinds from the global chip shortage.

As a result, after sliding back from above $190 per share, the stock has bounced between around $180 and $185 per share in the past few weeks.

As mentioned above, these numbers were not enough to further excite investor interest in TXN stock. Management’s commentary, on the surface, sounded bullish for the coming quarter.
