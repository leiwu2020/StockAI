Johnson likes Western Digital Corp (NASDAQ: WDC). He noticed a double bottom pattern on its chart and he said that a close above $76 would start another leg higher. The size of the setup on the chart suggests an upside potential of around 50%, with a measured move objective of $110, said Johnson. The company also had a great earnings print in April and it raised its guidance, he added. Shay is focusing on Gap Inc (NYSE: GPS), which is due to report earnings on May 27. The stock has high implied volatility going into the report so she sees the opportunity to sell some at the money premium. The options market is pricing in about a $3.5 to $4 move in Gap and the stock usually moves between 25 cents and $2, with one outlier of $4. For that reason, she is just going to trade the report. She is not buying the stock here, but she will be trading it next week.

(WDC) were up 5.4% in extended trading on Thursday after the data storage company’s fiscal third quarter results topped estimates. The company reported revenues of $4.1 billion, a decline of 1% year-on-year but that still topped analysts’ estimates of $3.97 billion. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.02 rose 20% year-on-year, beating consensus estimates of $0.68 per share. Western Digital’s CEO, David Goeckeler said, “We reported solid results above the guidance range, driven by increasing momentum of our energy-assisted drives and our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSDs, improving NAND flash pricing trends, along with the continued accelerated digital transformation across end markets.” In the fiscal third quarter, WDC’s 1% decline in revenues was a result of a fall in revenues for its Data Center Devices and Solutions business. However, the company observed a continued rise in demand for notebook and desktop personal computers (PCs) and new game consoles. For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company expects revenues to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion and expects gross margin to be between 29% and 31%. The company has forecast non-GAAP diluted EPS to land between $1.30 and $1.60. (See Western Digital Corp. stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the earnings, Robert W. Baird analyst Tristan Gerra raised the price target from $85 to $100 and reiterated a Buy on the stock. Gerra commented on the results, “NAND gross margin of 30% in the reported quarter highlights a still-early stage in cyclical recovery. We continue to expect NAND pricing to increase in C2H.” “Given the renewed execution, massive upcycle ahead characterized by strong demand and supply shortages, and NAND pricing on the cusp of a rebound, we see no reasons for WDC to not return to its prior EPS cycle peak,” Gerra added. Overall, consensus among analysts is that WDC is a Strong Buy based on 13 Buys and 4 Holds. The average analyst price target of $85.06 implies upside potential of about 19.6% from current levels.

(WDC) were up 5.4% in extended trading on Thursday after the data storage company’s fiscal third quarter results topped estimates. The company reported revenues of $4.1 billion, a decline of 1% year-on-year but that still topped analysts’ estimates of $3.97 billion.Non-GAAP EPS of $1.02 rose 20% year-on-year, beating consensus estimates of $0.68 per share.Western Digital’s CEO, David Goeckeler said, “We reported solid results above the guidance range, driven by increasing momentum of our energy-assisted drives and our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSDs, improving NAND flash pricing trends, along with the continued accelerated digital transformation across end markets.”In the fiscal third quarter, WDC’s 1% decline in revenues was a result of a fall in revenues for its Data Center Devices and Solutions business. However, the company observed a continued rise in demand for notebook and desktop personal computers (PCs) and new game consoles.  For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company expects revenues to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion and expects gross margin to be between 29% and 31%.

The company will soon begin considering successors for Tsunakawa, who returns to the CEO job he held previously, said Osamu Nagayama, chairperson of the board, during a press conference in Tokyo.The decision came as factions within the conglomerate mounted resistance to a potential buyout offer from CVC Capital Partners -- where Kurumatani previously worked. Some executives felt the offer undervalued a storied Japanese corporation that still holds valuable energy and semiconductor assets, according to people familiar with matter, who declined to be identified discussing internal issues. Separately, private equity firm KKR & Co. is exploring a rival offer for Toshiba, Bloomberg News reported.“The optics, combined with the facts that CVC’s bid is now supposedly lower than KKR’s, and that CVC lacks experience with deals of such scale, probably mean it is out of the running,” said Mio Kato, an analyst with LightStream Research who publishes on Smartkarma.Nagayama, the Toshiba board chairperson, said he isn’t sure whether Kurumatani’s resignation will affect talks with CVC because the offer is “very preliminary and not formal.” He noted CVC voiced support for current management while Kurumatani was in charge.The company’s shares rallied after news of KKR’s possible bid, but then pared those gains to close 5.8% higher.Kurumatani suffered a sharp drop in support among the company’s executives and other staff. Employees who have confidence in the CEO fell to less than 60% in an internal January poll, down from more than 90% last year, Bloomberg News reported this week. More than 20% expressed a lack of confidence in his leadership, up from less than 5% previously.The survey results prompted Toshiba to conduct detailed interviews with a narrower group of about 30 top executives and more than half of them expressed a lack of confidence in Kurumatani.“Kurumatani’s resignation settles some issues, gives the new CEO some breathing room and the benefit of the doubt as long as he makes the right noises,” said Travis Lundy, an independent analyst who publishes on Smartkarma. “It will improve morale slightly internally as well. But the issues that have caused problems with shareholders are also at the board level.”The loss of confidence in Kurumatani was due in part to his decision to stick with three-year targets set in 2018, one of the people said. Many executives thought those goals were no longer realistic because of the Covid-19 pandemic and feared pressure to meet them resembled the rigid attitude of his predecessors, which led to an accounting scandal, the person said.In the press conference Wednesday, Nagayama said the CEO was leaving because the company had made its return to the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.“Kurumatani offered his resignation as he feels his job to rehabilitate Toshiba is done with the return to the TSE’s first section,” Nagayama said. “We appreciate his efforts.”He said Kurumatani chose not to attend the press conference. The departing CEO did leave a letter, which a Toshiba spokesman read aloud.Kurumatani faced opposition outside the company too. He held on to his position by a slim margin last year, when only 57.2% of Toshiba shareholders approved of keeping him in the job. Questioning the transparency and process of that vote, Toshiba’s largest investor Effissimo Capital Management has requested an independent investigation, which was green-lit at an extraordinary shareholder meeting in March.​KKR is weighing a bid that would be likely to value Toshiba above the $21 billion buyout proposal that it’s already received from CVC, said one person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified as the details aren’t public. Canadian investment giant Brookfield Asset Management Inc. is also in the preliminary stages of exploring an offer for the company, including how such a bid might be structured, a separate person with knowledge of the matter said.The deliberations are at an early stage, no final decisions have been made, and the discussions may not lead to firm offers, the people said.Tsunakawa, the returning CEO, spent time during the press conference Wednesday offering reassurances that Toshiba would remain a strong Japanese company and invest in research and development. His comments appeared aimed at reassuring employees and business partners in the wake of the CVC offer.He also discussed Toshiba’s stake in Kioxia Holdings Corp., the memory chip business in which Toshiba sold off a majority stake. Tsunakawa said Toshiba would not sell its remaining holdings to a foreign semiconductor firm and that he anticipates the company will go public. The Wall Street Journal reported that Micron Technology Inc. and Western Digital Corp. are each exploring a potential deal for Kioxia.“We remain committed to provide our support to Kioxia’s IPO, and our stance on selling our holdings is unchanged,” he said.(Updates with chairperson’s comments from the fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=6f2d4797b6bbbe4a95632a4c7f259acf53c95d9325736a7e504e16555326e1e4

Back when the NASDAQ dipped 10% from its peak… Yeah, well, never mind about that. Markets are up, up, up lately. A strong jobs report last Friday has helped, showing 916,000 new positions in March, the best print since last August, and almost a quarter-million higher than expectations. Rising markets make it a good time to look at the ‘top picks’ from Wall Street’s stock analysts. The three stocks we’re looking at are an interesting lot, and they have certain commonalities: a Strong Buy consensus rating, tangible upside potential for investors, and a ‘Top Pick’ review. Using the TipRanks database, we’ve pulled the details on those stocks to find out what makes them so compelling. Here are the results. Ascendis Pharma (ASND) First up, Ascendis Pharma, is an ‘emerging’ biotechnology company with a primary focus on rare diseases in endocrinology. The company has an active pipeline, with three drug candidates in clinical trials for endocrine diseases, including pediatric and adult growth hormone deficiency, adult hypoparathyroidism, and achondroplasia. The company develops its medications using its TransCon technology, which allows the direct application of proteins, peptides, and small molecules to target areas of the body through a carrier drug with known biological action. In addition to its primary pipeline, Ascendis also has two oncology drug candidates in preclinical development. The company's pediatric growth hormone deficiency (GHD) drug, TransCon HGH (lonapegsomatropin), has completed a Phase 3 trial and the company is preparing for the PDUFA date at the end of June – with expectation of launching the drug commercially on the US market in 3Q21. Ascendis anticipates a European Commission decision on use of lonapegsomatropin during 4Q21. There is an ongoing global Phase 3 trial for adults with GHD, with complete enrollment expected by early next year, and Ascendis has submitted its clinical trial notification to begin a Phase 3 trial for pediatric patients in Japan. Furthermore, the company is preparing for Phase 3 clinical trials for TransCon PTH, a treatment for adult hypoparathyroidism. The company anticipates topline results in 4Q21. As above, the company is also proceeding with clinical trial notification in Japan, for 2Q21. With all of that in the background, Wedbush analyst Liana Moussatos listed ASND as one of her top picks for 2021 “In 2021, we look forward to 1) TC-hGH/pediatric growth hormone deficiency (GHD; lonapegsomatropin) June 25, 2021, PDUFA date; 2) potential TC-hGH/GHD MAA approval in Q4:21; and 3) topline results from the pivotal Phase 3 PaTHway for TCPTH in adult hypoparathyroidism (HP) in Q4:21. We see these events as potential inflection points for the stock. We expect 2021 to be a transformative year for Ascendis in front of several potential value creation events,” Moussatos noted. In line with these comments, Moussatos rates ASND shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and sets a $209 price target indicating a 60% one-year upside potential. (To watch Moussatos’ track record, click here) Moussatos is no outlier on Ascendis; this stock has 6 recent reviews, with 5 to Buy and 1 to Hold. The shares are priced at $130.63 and their $191.25 average price target suggests 46% growth in the next 12 months. (See ASND stock analysis on TipRanks) AlloVir (ALVR) The next company on our list, AlloVir, is another cutting-edge biotech firm. AlloVir’s focus is the development of allogenic, off-the-shelf virus-specific T-cell candidates. These are drugs specifically designed to prevent or treat viral infections in immunocompromised patients with T-cell deficiencies – and limited treatment options. The company’s pipeline features five candidate agents for the treatment of twelve ‘devastating’ viruses, including HHV-6, EBV, PIV, HBV, and even COVID-19. The most advanced drug candidate in the pipeline, ALVR105, also called Viralym-M, is undergoing trials for a range of applications, including the treatment of virus-associated hemorrhagic-cystitis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and adenovirus (AdV). In addition, there are clinical studies of the drug candidate as a preventative for BKV, CMV, AdV, EBV, HHV-6 and others viral diseases. The clinical trials range from Phase 1b/2 to Phase 3. The company’s lead candidate, Viralym-M, is in an ongoing Phase 3 trial for the treatment of virus-associated hemorrhagic-cystitis. The company also tests Viralym-M in two proof-of-concept Phase 2 trials. These include a clinical study of the drug candidate as a first of its kind, multi-virus preventative for HSCT recipients and a study of the drug in the treatment of BK viremia in kidney transplant patients. These trials are ongoing, and actively recruiting patients. In addition to ALVR105/Viralym-M, the company next two most advanced programs are ALVR 109 and ALVR106. ALVR109 has entered Phase 1 proof-of-concept clinical trial as a treatment for COVID-19. Preclinical data released in December demonstrated disease specific antiviral activity. ALVR 106 has had its investigation new drug (IND) application approved, and is cleared to initiate clinical trials in the treatment of influence, PIV, and respiratory syncytial virus. In his coverage of this stock for Piper Sandler, 5-star analyst Christopher Raymond writes, “[All] important timelines remain essentially on track. To us, the most critical of those are Phase 2 POC data for Viralym-M in the prevention setting for HSCT patients and for Phase 2 POC data for Viralym-M in the treatment of BK virus in kidney transplant recipients. Those two events remain on track for 2H21. While we do not model contribution form ALVR109 (in high-risk patients with COVID-19), we note that POC data from that program is also anticipated 2H21.” At the bottom line, Raymond says, “[We] continue to view ALVR as an emerging leader in virus specific cell therapies… it remains a top 2021 pick.” To this end, Raymond gives ALVR an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, and his $55 price target implies a robust upside of ~132% for the year ahead. (To watch Raymond’s track record, click here) Like the Piper Sandler analyst, the rest of the Street is bullish on ALVR. 3 Buy ratings compared to no Holds or Sells add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. At $49.33, the average price target implies upside potential of ~108%. (See ALVR stock analysis on TipRanks) Western Digital (WDC) From biotech to high-tech, we’ll change gears and look at Western Digital. The company produces hard disks and other data storage, including SSDs and flash memory. Western Digital's products are used in the data center and cloud storage industries; Western Digital includes well-known brands like WD and SanDisk. As can be imagined, Western Digital has seen steady business in the last 18 months, despite the COVID pandemic. The move toward remote work and virtual offices put a premium on computer chips of all sorts, including memory and cloud storage. WDC’s revenues have held steady through that period, near $4 billion quarterly. For the past two years, the company has reported quarterly revenues in the range between $3.67 billion and $4.29 billion; the most recent quarter, 2Q fiscal 21, showed $3.94 billion at the top line, with non-GAAP EPS of 69 cents per share and free cash flow of $149 million. The company presented forward guidance for fiscal Q3, projecting the top line between $3.85 billion and $4.05 billion and non-GAAP EPS between 55 and 75 cents. Investors like predictability, and Western Digital’s performance has been just that. The company’s stock has benefited, and the shares are up 87% over the past 12 months. This is a modest outperformance compared to the NASDAQ index, which is up 73% over the same period. C J Muse, 5-star analyst with Evercore ISI, digs deep under the hood of Western Digital, and summing up writes, “While WDC shares are up 25% YTD, we see at least another 30% upside fueled by meaningful positive revisions to forward EPS estimates…. consensus estimates are moving materially higher with potential CY21 exit run rate of ~$10+ (cons $7.60) and additional upside into CY22 (we see stretch goal of $15.00 vs. current cons $7.44)…. With vision to at least 30% upside as the NAND industry emerges from a cyclical trough, WDC remains a Top Pick.” Muse puts a $100 price target on WDC, for a 38% one-year upside potential. (To watch Muse’s track record, click here) Tech companies typically garner a lot of analyst attention, and Western Digital has 21 recent stock reviews. These break down to 17 Buys against just 4 Holds, giving the stock its Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares are priced at $72.22, and the $80.26 average target implies an 11% upside from that level.

company,1617840580,Activists Get Their Moment in Japan With $21 Billion Toshiba Bid,66316577,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nyebpMTbVLV.jtDJpSMfeA--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/b4d1e0e1715060277e2ed65d1beaaed9,WDC,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- The surprise takeover bid for Toshiba Corp. is a palpable demonstration of the growing influence in corporate Japan of activist investors, who have gone from largely impotent onlookers to kingmakers in the space of just a few years.The offer from CVC Capital Partners, while still in the early stages, comes just weeks after Toshiba Chief Executive Officer Nobuaki Kurumatani lost a landmark shareholder vote, forcing an independent investigation into alleged issues with voting at its annual general meeting last year.That loss has piled pressure on Kurumatani, who barely won re-election at last year’s meeting and is seen as unlikely to survive another. The vote was triggered by Toshiba’s largest shareholder, the secretive Singapore-based hedge fund Effissimo Capital Management.Any deal for Toshiba faces legal hurdles, and analysts say that investors such as Effissimo would likely insist on a substantial premium from Tuesday’s closing price. But the episode shows that the influence of activism in Japan is becoming hard to deny.“There have been false dawns before,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “But activism is taking hold now.”Flexing MusclesCVC offered about 5,000 yen per share in its buyout proposal, according to a Toshiba executive. A bid at that level would value Toshiba at about 2.28 trillion yen ($20.7 billion) and represent a 31% premium to its last close before news of the bid emerged, data compiled by Bloomberg show.That would make it the largest private equity-led buyout since 2013, and CVC’s biggest acquisition on record. Toshiba’s board plans to form a special committee to consider the proposal, said the executive, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information.While there are many hurdles to a deal taking place, Toshiba shares rose by their daily limit of 18% to 4,530 yen per share at the close Wednesday in Tokyo. The stock gained as much as 5.7% more on Thursday.“Considerable value would be created simply by simplifying ownership and clarifying governance by taking the company private,” said Nicholas Benes, an expert on Japanese corporate governance. “Precisely because of that, one would very much hope that this is a case where Toshiba will be open to other bids, by both other PE firms as well as strategic acquirers.”Activist investors have increasingly been flexing their muscle in Japan in recent years, as corporate governance reforms promoting shareholder value have meant management can no longer dismiss such pressure. Tokyo Dome Corp. will be delisted this month after acquisition by a white knight last year to fend off pressure from activist investor Oasis Management Co.Once a storied name in Japan, Toshiba has faded dramatically since its glory days after years of management missteps and scandal. The conglomerate invented flash memory three decades ago, but it was forced to sell most of its prized chip business in 2018 because of losses in its nuclear-power operation. That deal led to an infusion of cash -- but also a large contingent of more vocal shareholders. Last week, Singapore fund 3D Investment Partners became the latest investor to say it may make make proposals to management, boosting its stake to more than 7%.“Any successes of this nature will probably snowball and lead to more activity,” said Damian Thong, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. “There is a sense that a large part of Japan’s industrial base is being run inefficiently, resulting in apparent undervaluation of Japanese conglomerates.”Kioxia OptionsOne open question for Toshiba is the future of Kioxia Holdings Corp., its former memory-chip division in which its still holds the biggest stake. Kioxia is focused on going public as soon as this summer in an IPO that could value the business at more than $36 billion, Bloomberg News reported last week. Alternatively, Micron Technology Inc. and Western Digital Corp. are each to be interested in acquiring the firm, the Wall Street Journal reported.If Toshiba secures a reasonable market valuation for Kioxia, and its core businesses attract multiples similar to those of its Japan peers, Thong said he sees scope for over 1 trillion yen of shareholder value creation. That would imply a Toshiba share price of over 6,500 yen per share, compared with the CVC offer at 5,000 yen apiece.Mio Kato of LightStream Research sees a low possibility of the deal going through under current terms, and expects volatile trading for Toshiba’s shares in the near term depending on how things develop. Toshiba’s shareholders, especially activists, will want a rather “steep price,” he wrote in a note published on SmartKarma.Given the sensitivity around several of Toshiba’s bushinesses, including its deep involvement in decommissioning the wrecked Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant, government approval would be required for the deal, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said Wednesday.It’s unclear if a foreign firm such as CVC would be allowed to take control of Toshiba. The relationship between CVC and Toshiba executives -- with Kurumatani a former Japan president and external director Yoshiaki Fujimori still employed by the firm -- has also raised eyebrows.“This could simply be an attempt to buy time for Kurumatani,” Kato said.(Updates with share move in eighth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=defe1ac61076fe2f0824ec7dcb0173c4861699bfc1b2f2c6d3f235acdb52a787

Julie Currie, former vice president of human resources at Western Digital (Nasdaq: WDC), joins as Amplitude’s first Chief People Officer, and Elizabeth Fisher, former vice president, deputy general counsel at Postmates joins as the company’s first General Counsel. These appointments represent milestone investments in the company’s people, culture and growth strategies, as Amplitude continues to build on momentum following a year of record growth in 2020. Currie is an accomplished HR executive recognized across the industry as a visionary leader in progressive workforce strategies and the future of work. She brings broad global experience leading and scaling people, culture and diversity and inclusion strategies for high growth companies, including through international expansions, mergers, acquisitions and integrations, and an initial public offering (IPO). Prior to Western Digital, she held roles as senior vice president of human resources at Inphi and Sony Interactive Entertainment of America. “Throughout my career I’ve had the opportunity to work with transformative technology companies to foster strong cultures and remarkable employee experiences. I’m excited to bring my passion for people to shape the workplace and talent strategy at Amplitude,” said Currie. “This past year has reinforced the importance of having a company culture rooted in strong values, diversity and resilience. I believe in the amazing culture that Spenser and his leadership team have instilled, and look forward to scaling that alongside the business as Amplitude continues to grow.” Fisher brings to Amplitude extensive legal expertise spanning the legal landscape from business litigation to in-house counsel. At Postmates, she supported the company’s rapid expansion by scaling the legal team, providing strategic advice to executive leadership, and negotiating partnerships and deals. Her role also included managing late-stage merger and acquisition and exit efforts, including IPO preparation and the company’s $2.65 billion acquisition by Uber. “I’ve been an Amplitude customer for several years at Postmates and have long been impressed with the technology and the team,” said Fisher. “It’s an exciting time to be joining the company, fueled by stellar momentum from 2020. Amplitude is at the forefront of innovation for digital businesses, and I can’t wait to join and help support the company’s ongoing growth.” “I’m thrilled to welcome Julie and Liz to Amplitude at a time of enormous growth and opportunity for the business,” said Spenser Skates, Amplitude CEO. “The world has moved to digital-first and we play a central role in helping every company evolve their digital business. At this critical point in our journey, we need the right leadership team in place to foster what makes this company special -- our people and our culture -- and continue to drive the business forward as we lead and shape the market.” Currie’s and Fisher’s appointments follow record growth for Amplitude in 2020 and bolster a leadership team that recently expanded with the appointment of Jennifer Johnson as chief marketing and strategy officer. Amplitude has received industry recognition for its culture and people strategies, most recently being named one of the 2021 Best Places to Work in the Bay Area by the Silicon Valley Business Journal.
