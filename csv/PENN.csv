A number of hot stocks have come crashing back to earth, while value stocks have continued to trade well. The indexes have been holding up near the highs during these big sector rotations, so some of these stocks have done quite well despite the deep pullback in others. Where does that leave some of the hottest stocks riding the strongest trends? Like the broad-market view, some have done quite well while others have endured large pullbacks. Others have been experiencing increased volatility, as they’re in economically-sensitive industries. For instance, travel stocks have been volatile, but are riding strong momentum into the summer. Many tech companies are also riding strong secular trends, but have endured a large selloff.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 7 Best Stocks for Upcoming Grads to Buy and Hold Forever In any regard, these trends and the recent volatility has created opportunities. Let’s look at seven hot stocks riding these trends into the summer. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Boeing (NYSE:BA) Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN) Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Home Depot (NYSE:HD) Southwest Airlines (LUV) Source: Markus Mainka / Shutterstock.com As mundane as the airlines can be, it’s foolish not to expect a sharp rebound in traffic. As the vaccination rate continues to climb in the U.S., more and more economies are reopening. Further, more and more people are feeling comfortable enough to go out. For some, that just means going out to eat at a restaurant again. For others, it’s getting on a plane and taking a trip. We’re seeing the number of travelers climb, too, as the TSA checkpoint tally continues to tick up in the U.S. We don’t know when we’ll return to pre-coronavirus levels, but Southwest Airlines and its peers will be beneficiaries of the return to travel. In the company’s most recent quarterly report, Southwest generated mixed results. Revenue still slumped 51% vs. a year ago, while it lost less per share than analysts were looking for. However, management told LUV stock investors that it expects to return to breakeven results by June. This gave investors hope that a return to profitability may not be all that far off. Boeing (BA) Source: Alex JW Robinson / Shutterstock.com In order for Boeing to benefit from a return to travel, it needs to see its customers — like Southwest for instance — also return to a better state. As the airlines win, so, too, should Boeing. The company has pushed through a double-whammy of pain. First, its 737-MAX debacle weighed heavily on the stock. At the 2020 peak, Boeing stock was more than 20% below its all-time highs due to issues with its best-selling jet. Then Covid-19 came along, completely disrupting the travel industry and leading to one of the worst years in Boeing’s history. The plus side to all of this? It’s now in the rearview mirror. Travel is storming back, as pent-up demand continues to drive strong traffic numbers in the second quarter of the year. We can only imagine what the summer and the back half of 2021 is going to look like. 7 Cheap Stocks With Dividends for Both Returns and Cash Flow Further, Boeing recently said it’s looking at increasing production of its 737-MAX in the future. That also comes as other aviation agencies give the plane the thumbs up, allowing it to return to safety. Between the two catalysts, we should see multiple years worth of solid growth for Boeing, allowing BA stock to continue its move higher. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) Source: Wangkun Jia / Shutterstock.com Another travel industry seeing a return of traffic? Casinos. Due to that trend, we should see strong results out of Wynn Resorts. The company is considered a top property on the Las Vegas strip, although Wynn also generates considerable revenue in Macau. Thankfully, that region is also seeing growth. In February, Macau saw its first month of year-over-year growth in more than a year. It did so again in March. We’re also seeing a strong rebound in Las Vegas traffic, too. The city is expected to see strong volumes over the Memorial Day weekend and that should be a boon for companies like Wynn. As we push into the second half of 2021, I expect to see these trends improve too. While analysts still expect WYNN stock to lose about $5 a share this year, that’s a considerable improvement from the $19.18 loss per share in 2020. Plus, forecasts also call for revenue to jump more than 105% this year. In 2022, momentum should remain strong, with estimates calling for almost 50% revenue revenue growth and 130% earnings growth along with a return to profitability. Penn National Gaming (PENN) Source: Jeffrey J Coleman / Shutterstock.com Penn National Gaming is another casino company that should do well. While it may not be considered as high-end as Wynn, Penn’s locations throughout the country should thrive this year in year-over-year comparisons. That’s as consumers look for things to do and have nights out on the town. That’s going to fuel the company’s growth over the next 12 to to 24 months. Las Vegas just posted its best month in years, highlighting the pent-up demand for the “return to normal” move. While that will move the need for Penn in the short term, the company has other long-term drivers to focus on as well. Just before Covid-19 hit, Penn made a deal with Barstool Sports, acquiring a 36% stake in the digital media company. It has warrants allowing it to take control of a majority stake in the future, assuming management likes the direction the business is heading. 7 Best Stocks for Upcoming Grads to Buy and Hold Forever Not only does this generate revenue, but it can also help fuel traffic toward Penn’s online gaming and sports gambling initiatives. That trend alone is realizing strong secular growth and should continue through the rest of the decade as other states get involved as well. While analysts expect 50% revenue growth this year, estimates call for sales growth of just 8% in 2022. That could prove conservative if momentum remains strong. PENN stock’s recent dip only provides investors with an even better long-term opportunity. DraftKings (DKNG) Source: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com DraftKings may not have the physical footprint that Wynn or Penn have. However, it has a much bigger footprint in the online gaming and sports gambling markets. Considered a leader among daily fantasy sports games, DraftKings is in a great position. Like Penn, DKNG stock has endured a painful selloff, falling 46% to the recent low. But also like Penn, that only provides investors with a better opportunity if they are looking for a long-term investment. The knock here? Expenses. DraftKings can tighten the bootstraps and ease its cash burn rather quickly. We saw that in the early days of Covid-19. However, with the online sports betting market looking like the Wild Wild West, taking market share is key. And to get market share, companies need marketing. While DraftKings marketing is working — as it continues to garner plenty of market share — it’s not a cheap endeavor. The plus side of all this is that revenue has been exploding. Forecasts call for almost 90% revenue growth this year to roughly $1.2 billion. Keep in mind, just a few months ago, consensus estimates for this year sat below $600 million. So while growth is screaming higher, it’s coming at the sacrifice of profits. For some investors, they don’t mind. For others, that’s a problem. But in either case, there’s no denying the trend in this one. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com Alphabet has to be one of the best investments out there. The company has almost always had solid top- and bottom-line growth and its balance is one of the strongest on Wall Street. One could argue that it’s failed to fully capitalize some of the bigger trends in streaming video, social media and streaming music. However, it’s hard to knock Alphabet as a business. At $1.6 trillion, it commands a massive market capitalization, but GOOGL stock has a reasonable valuation given its moat and financials. With a return to growth in the online advertising world, Google is in prime position to benefit. So is YouTube. And it’s also worth mentioning that Google.com and YouTube.com are the top two websites in the world. 7 Cheap Stocks With Dividends for Both Returns and Cash Flow Analysts expect revenue to grow 30% this year, alongside 50% earnings growth. All this occurs while Alphabet has $135 billion in cash and equivalents. Oh, let’s also not forget this has been the best-performing FAANG component this year, over the last six months and over the past year. Home Depot (HD) Source: Mihai_Andritoiu / Shutterstock.com If one thing has been clear before, during and after the pandemic, it’s that consumers want to invest in their homes. Sometimes that’s remodeling a kitchen or getting new floors put in. Other times it’s building an entire structure. Whatever contractors and DIYers are looking for, Home Depot helps them out. That’s clear by the company’s recent quarterly results as well. Home Depot delivered its fourth straight top- and bottom-line beats. Revenue of $37.5 billion grew almost 33% year over year and — get this — beat expectations by more than $3 billion. Comp-store sales growth of 31% easily beat analysts’ expectations of 20.2% growth, while earnings of $3.86 per share cruised past expectations of $3.02 a share. All of this points to one thing: Home improvement revenue is booming. As Home Depot approaches its biggest quarter of the year (Q2), I don’t expect consumers to slow down on their spending. Keep an eye on this one, even though HD stock has been on fire. On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in DKNG.

The selloff has widened the gap between its stock price and the average analyst target by the most ever, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.And while that has led to Goldman Sachs recommending investors buy the dip and Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management lapping up shares of the Boston-based company, most investors aren’t budging. The stock slumped 4.3% to $42.11 on Wednesday, the eighth decline in the past 10 trading sessions. After ending last year up more than 300%, the shares have lapsed into oversold territory for the first time since it went public via a reverse merger in April 2020.To be sure, the U.S. stock market has also been in a tailspin amid growing concerns of rising inflation with the S&P 500 Index sinking 2.1% Wednesday, the biggest drop since Feb. 25.DraftKings has been caught under pressure alongside high-flying companies that have yet to turn a profit like Uber Technologies Inc. and Teladoc Health Inc. as inflation fears whipsaw the broader market. While the company posted revenue that beat analyst expectations, the widening losses drew ire from analysts and investors.“That kind of result just isn’t enough to get it done in this marketplace,” Needham analyst Bernie McTernan said by telephone. “This is going to be quite the opportunity for people to step in now” though catalysts like a March investor day and some state legalizations of online gambling are in the rear-view mirror.Still, Goldman’s Stephen Grambling, who is among the stock’s 20 buy-rated analysts, said investors should “buy the dip” as the company’s strong revenue outlook showcased the momentum. The market should return its focus to improving fundamentals for the company and the broader sports betting market, the analyst argued.The latest drop for DraftKings mirrors the slide for peer Penn National Gaming Inc. which also released results that were stronger than analysts expected last week.“DraftKings sticks out like a sore thumb in terms of way underperforming with a pretty decent print,” Needham’s McTernan said. “With Penn it was a beat-and-raise quarter where the regional casino business is just on fire and I think you’ll have the best of both worlds with Penn in the reopening and leveraging the Barstool brand.”The latest drop for DraftKings pushed it to the lowest level in six months, while Penn National’s 8.4% drop on Wednesday pressured it to close at the lowest since Dec. 11.(Updates share movement throughout.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=afabb848d89fd0523ca9d57be180726592414d33464789bf9c4b47f4717bb7df

This year, according to a FinancialBuzz report, 19 U.S. states are expected to decide on the legalization of sports betting which could significantly benefit online sports betting companies. Using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, we will compare two online betting companies, DraftKings and Penn National Gaming, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks. DraftKings (DKNG) DraftKings is an online sports gaming and entertainment company that provides its users with a sports betting Sportsbook, daily fantasy sports, and online casino gaming opportunities. Last week, DKNG reported first-quarter revenues of $312 million, a jump of 253% year-on-year. Revenue was up 175% year-on-year after giving pro-forma effect to the company’s acquisition of Diamond Eagle Acquisition Corp and SBTech Global Ltd that was completed on April 23 last year. However, the company’s losses widened to $346.3 million in Q1 versus a loss of $68.7 million in the same quarter last year. DraftKings’ Chief Financial Officer, Jason Park said, “Our $312 million in first quarter revenue, 114% increase in MUPs [monthly unique payers] and 48% growth in ARPMUP [Average Revenue per MUP] reflect solid customer acquisition and retention as well as successful launches of mobile sports betting and iGaming in new states. We are raising our revenue outlook for 2021 due to the outperformance of our core business in the first quarter and our expectation for continued healthy growth.” The company has raised its financial outlook for FY21 and expects revenues to land between $1.05 billion and $1.15 billion versus earlier forecasts of between $900 million and $1 billion. This indicates year-on-year growth of between 63% and 79%. The upgraded guidance is a result of DKNG’s strong activation of its user base due to effective marketing, the launch of mobile sports betting in Michigan and Virginia, and iGaming in Michigan. The fiscal outlook also assumes that all professional and college sports events take place as scheduled, and DKNG continues to operate in the U.S. states in which online sports betting is currently live. DraftKings' online sports betting is live in 12 U.S. states at present. That represent 25% of the U.S. population. The company’s Co-Founder, CEO, and Chairman, Jason Robins said on the earnings call, “We believe the outlook for further legalization is very promising. In 2021, more than 20 state legislatures have introduced legislation to legalize online sports betting.” The company anticipates both its monthly unique payers (MUP) and average revenue per MUPs (ARPMUP) to increase in FY21 with MUPs growing at a higher rate than ARPMUP. DKNG also gave a quarterly revenue breakup for FY21 and expects Q1 revenue to represent 28% of FY21 total revenue while second-quarter revenue is forecast to account for slightly higher than 20%. Q3 revenue is expected to represent slightly less than 20% of the full-year revenue, with fourth quarter revenue likely to account for 30%. The company anticipates higher sales and marketing spend in FY21 than FY20 as it has become the official sports betting partner of the National Football League (NFL). DraftKings also gave some color regarding its adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for FY21 and expects it to be the deepest in Q3 due to higher sales and marketing spend as the NFL season kicks-off with “three states in their first full NFL season”. (See DraftKings stock analysis on TipRanks) Yesterday, Northland Securities analyst Greg Gibas reiterated a Buy and a price target of $70 on the stock. Gibas commented on DKNG’s Q1 results, “DKNG reported strong Q1 results featuring revenue growth that was well ahead of consensus, accompanied by solid 2021 guidance upside. Top-line growth was driven by better than expected user activation (MUPs) following the well-executed launches in Michigan and Virginia, as well as overall strong unique payer retention and acquisition across DFS [daily fantasy sports platform], SB [sportsbook], & iG [iGaming] offerings.” Shares of DKNG have plunged 23.5% in the past month. Overall, consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 17 Buys and 6 Holds. The average analyst price target of $70.86 indicates upside potential of around 59.2% from current levels. Penn National Gaming (PENN) Penn National Gaming has ownership interests in or owns and operates 41 racing and gaming properties across 19 states in the United States. The company offers online sports betting in Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, and West Virginia. Last year, PENN acquired a 36% stake in Barstool Sports, a digital media company for $163 million. Since then, the company has launched its Barstool Sportsbook app and products in the states of Illinois, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. PENN also operates online sports betting in the states of West Virginia, Iowa, Indiana, and Pennsylvania through strategic partnerships and has an interactive gaming division through its subsidiary, Penn Interactive Ventures, that has launched iCasino in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Last week, the company reported its first-quarter results with revenues of $1,274.9 million, down 6% compared to pro-forma results from the first quarter of 2019, while adjusted EBITDAR was up 7% to $447 million. Jay Snowden, President, and Chief Executive Officer stated, “We remain focused on garnering top-three gaming revenue market share for the Barstool Sportsbook and driving best in class profitability. Since launching our product just over seven months ago, we have registered more than 400,000 customers and generated over $660 million and $61 million in handle and gaming revenue, respectively. We plan for the online Barstool Sportsbook to be live in eight states by football season and in at least 10 states before the end of the year.” PENN intends to open or rebrand six more retail sportsbooks by the end of this year. The company is also looking at increasing cross-selling opportunities through its mychoice mobile app that was launched last quarter. According to the company, the app has been downloaded 333,000 times with monthly active users of approximately 115,000. The company stated that the app allows for more meaningful user engagement, provides for targeted marketing, and is a key driver of growth in revenues. (See Penn National Gaming stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the Q1 earnings on May 6, Deutsche Bank analyst Carlo Santarelli reiterated a Sell with a price target of $31 on the stock. Santarelli said in a research note to investors, “PENN's 1Q21 net revenue was $55 mm ahead of our forecast, though adjusted EBITDAR was relatively in line, coming in 1% ahead of our estimate ($447 mm versus our $442 mm estimate), as margins fell 120 bps shy of our forecast. The South and Midwest regions drove upside to our estimate, though this was largely offset by higher other segment (corporate/interactive/OSB) losses.” “Given peer reports, we don't find the upside to Consensus to be overly surprising to many, and as such, we think the stock reaction will likely be more tied to the equity market direction…Management noted that spend per visit remains considerably higher than preCOVID levels, while visitation has returned to near pre-COVID levels as the 55+ customer has been returning,” Santarelli added. Shares of PENN have plunged by almost 21% in the past month. Overall, consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 6 Buys, 1 Hold, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $116.57 indicates upside potential of around 45.4% from current levels. Bottom Line The rising legalization of online sports betting in the United States could benefit both DKNG and PENN as it could offer significant revenue-generating opportunities for the companies. While currently, both stocks appear to indicate significant upside potential over the next 12 months, analysts seem to be more bullish on DKNG’s long-term growth prospects.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=248a666a3e08ab8ab810f401b7c8cdd32dfcaa1d719890a6e1cc498242c35714

This year, according to a FinancialBuzz report, 19 U.S. states are expected to decide on the legalization of sports betting which could significantly benefit online sports betting companies.Using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, we will compare two online betting companies, DraftKings and Penn National Gaming, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.DraftKings (DKNG)DraftKings is an online sports gaming and entertainment company that provides its users with a sports betting Sportsbook, daily fantasy sports, and online casino gaming opportunities.  Last week, DKNG reported first-quarter revenues of $312 million, a jump of 253% year-on-year. Revenue was up 175% year-on-year after giving pro-forma effect to the company’s acquisition of Diamond Eagle Acquisition Corp and SBTech Global Ltd that was completed on April 23 last year.However, the company’s losses widened to $346.3 million in Q1 versus a loss of $68.7 million in the same quarter last year.DraftKings’ Chief Financial Officer, Jason Park said, “Our $312 million in first quarter revenue, 114% increase in MUPs [monthly unique payers] and 48% growth in ARPMUP [Average Revenue per MUP] reflect solid customer acquisition and retention as well as successful launches of mobile sports betting and iGaming in new states. We are raising our revenue outlook for 2021 due to the outperformance of our core business in the first quarter and our expectation for continued healthy growth.”The company has raised its financial outlook for FY21 and expects revenues to land between $1.05 billion and $1.15 billion versus earlier forecasts of between $900 million and $1 billion. This indicates year-on-year growth of between 63% and 79%.The upgraded guidance is a result of DKNG’s strong activation of its user base due to effective marketing, the launch of mobile sports betting in Michigan and Virginia, and iGaming in Michigan. The fiscal outlook also assumes that all professional and college sports events take place as scheduled, and DKNG continues to operate in the U.S. states in which online sports betting is currently live.DraftKings' online sports betting is live in 12 U.S. states at present. That represent 25% of the U.S. population. The company’s Co-Founder, CEO, and Chairman, Jason Robins said on the earnings call, “We believe the outlook for further legalization is very promising. In 2021, more than 20 state legislatures have introduced legislation to legalize online sports betting.”The company anticipates both its monthly unique payers (MUP) and average revenue per MUPs (ARPMUP) to increase in FY21 with MUPs growing at a higher rate than ARPMUP.DKNG also gave a quarterly revenue breakup for FY21 and expects Q1 revenue to represent 28% of FY21 total revenue while second-quarter revenue is forecast to account for slightly higher than 20%. Q3 revenue is expected to represent slightly less than 20% of the full-year revenue, with fourth quarter revenue likely to account for 30%.The company anticipates higher sales and marketing spend in FY21 than FY20 as it has become the official sports betting partner of the National Football League (NFL).DraftKings also gave some color regarding its adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for FY21 and expects it to be the deepest in Q3 due to higher sales and marketing spend as the NFL season kicks-off with “three states in their first full NFL season”. (See DraftKings stock analysis on TipRanks)Yesterday, Northland Securities analyst Greg Gibas reiterated a Buy and a price target of $70 on the stock. Gibas commented on DKNG’s Q1 results, “DKNG reported strong Q1 results featuring revenue growth that was well ahead of consensus, accompanied by solid 2021 guidance upside. Top-line growth was driven by better than expected user activation (MUPs) following the well-executed launches in Michigan and Virginia, as well as overall strong unique payer retention and acquisition across DFS [daily fantasy sports platform], SB [sportsbook], & iG [iGaming] offerings.”Shares of DKNG have plunged 23.5% in the past month.Overall, consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 17 Buys and 6 Holds. The average analyst price target of $70.86 indicates upside potential of around 59.2% from current levels.Penn National Gaming (PENN)Penn National Gaming has ownership interests in or owns and operates 41 racing and gaming properties across 19 states in the United States. The company offers online sports betting in Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, and West Virginia.Last year, PENN acquired a 36% stake in Barstool Sports, a digital media company for $163 million.

(NASDAQ: GLPI) (“GLPI” or the “Company”) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. Financial Highlights Three Months Ended March 31,(in millions, except per share data) 2021 2020 Total Revenue $301.5 $283.5 Income from Operations $200.1 $186.4 Net Income $127.2 $96.9 FFO (1) $183.6 $151.2 AFFO (2) $195.7 $188.8 Adjusted EBITDA (3) $266.6 $258.8 Net income, per diluted common share $0.54 $0.45 FFO, per diluted common share $0.79 $0.70 AFFO, per diluted common share $0.84 $0.88 _________________________________________ (1) FFO is net income, excluding (gains) or losses from sales of property and real estate depreciation as defined by NAREIT. (2) AFFO is FFO, excluding stock based compensation expense, the amortization of debt issuance costs, bond premiums and original issuance discounts, other depreciation, amortization of land rights, straight-line rent adjustments and losses on debt extinguishment, reduced by capital maintenance expenditures. (3) Adjusted EBITDA is net income, excluding interest, taxes on income, depreciation, (gains) or losses from sales of property, stock based compensation expense, straight-line rent adjustments, amortization of land rights, and losses on debt extinguishment. Peter Carlino, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GLPI, commented, ""Our record first quarter financial results highlight our long-term focus on aligning with the industry’s top regional gaming operators, expanding and diversifying our portfolio of regional gaming assets, and supporting our tenants, resulting in the predictability and growth of our rental cash flows and dividends. Our tenant roster features management teams with proven track records in highly-competitive markets which has enabled our tenants to successfully reopen their properties thereby increasing the longer-term visibility of our rental receipts. “Our long-term strategy includes tenant diversification beyond the proven management teams with whom we currently work. In this regard, earlier this month we expanded our relationship with Bally's Corporation in a series of transactions whereby we will acquire the real estate assets of its casino properties in Rock Island, Illinois and Black Hawk, Colorado. We expect the acquisition of the Rock Island and Black Hawk real estate to close early next year and generate incremental annual rent of $12 million. These assets are expected to be added to our previously announced Bally’s master lease for their Tropicana Evansville and Dover Downs Hotel & Casino properties, which is expected to be completed mid-2021. ""We are delighted to expand and diversify our relationship with Bally’s through transactions that deliver strong rent coverage and an accretive cap rate. By adding to the planned master lease with Bally’s, securing rights of first refusal on potential future assets and converting the Tropicana Las Vegas into an income producing ground lease, we expect to drive incremental cash flows while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We expect our tenants' strength, combined with our standing as the sector's only investment-grade balance sheet, to allow GLPI to consistently grow its cash flows and build value for shareholders in 2021 and beyond.” Recent Developments As of April 29, 2021, all of GLPI's 48 properties, (including those owned and operated in the Company's taxable REIT subsidiaries) are open to the public in some capacity.On April 13, 2021, GLPI announced an expansion in its relationship with Bally's Corporation (NYSE: BALY) (""Bally's"") to acquire the real estate assets of Bally's casino properties in Rock Island, Illinois and Black Hawk, Colorado, for total consideration of $150 million. The parties expect to add the properties to the master lease that will be created in connection with Bally's previously announced acquisitions of Tropicana Evansville and Dover Downs Hotel & Casino (the ""Bally's Master Lease"") (described more fully below). This transaction is expected to generate incremental rent of $12.0 million, with a normalized rent coverage of 2.25x in the first calendar year post-acquisition. The acquisitions of the real estate assets of Bally's properties in Rock Island and Black Hawk are expected to close in early 2022. Additionally, Bally’s granted GLPI a right of first refusal to fund the real property acquisition or development project costs associated with all potential future transactions in Michigan, Maryland, New York and Virginia through one or more sale-leaseback or similar transactions for a term of seven years. Bally’s plans to acquire both GLPI’s non-land real estate assets and Penn National Gaming, Inc.’s (NASDAQ: PENN) (""Penn"") outstanding equity interests in Tropicana Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, Inc. for an aggregate cash acquisition price of $150 million. GLPI would retain ownership of the land and concurrently enter into a 50-year ground lease with initial annual rent of $10.5 million. The ground lease would be supported by a Bally’s corporate guarantee and cross-defaulted with the Bally’s Master Lease. This transaction is expected to close in early 2022.Both GLPI and Bally’s have committed to a structure whereby GLPI has the potential to acquire additional assets in sale-leaseback transactions to the extent Bally’s elects to utilize GLPI’s capital as a funding source for their proposed acquisition of Gamesys Group plc. The $500 million commitment provides Bally’s an alternative financing commitment which at GLPI’s sole discretion may be funded in the form of equity, additional prepaid sale-leaseback transactions or secured loans. On December 15, 2020, the Company announced an agreement to sell the operations of Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge (""HCBR"") to Casino Queen for $28.2 million. GLPI will continue to own the real estate and will enter into an amended master lease with Casino Queen, which will include both their current DraftKings at Casino Queen property in East St. Louis and the HCBR facility, for annual cash rent of $21.4 million with a new initial term of 15 years and four 5-year extensions. This rental amount will be increased annually by 0.5% for the first six years. Beginning with the seventh lease year through the remainder of the lease term, if the Consumer Price Index (""CPI"") increases by at least 0.25% for any lease year then annual rent shall be increased by 1.25%, and if the CPI increase is less than 0.25% then rent will remain unchanged for such lease year. GLPI will complete the previously announced landside development project at HCBR and the rent under the master lease will be adjusted upon completion to reflect a yield of 8.25% on our project costs. GLPI will also have a right of first refusal with Casino Queen for other sale leaseback transactions for up to an incremental $50 million of rent over the next 2 years. Finally, upon the closing of the transaction, which is expected in the second half of 2021, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, GLPI will receive a one-time cash payment of $4 million in satisfaction of the outstanding loan to Casino Queen. On December 15, 2020, the Company announced that Penn exercised its option to acquire the operations of Hollywood Casino Perryville for $31.1 million in cash. GLPI will enter into a new lease with Penn with an initial term of 20 years, with three 5-year renewal options, for the real estate assets associated with the property for an initial annual cash rent of $7.77 million, $5.83 million of which will be subject to escalation provisions beginning in the second lease year through the fourth lease year and shall increase by 1.50% and then to 1.25% for the remaining lease term. The escalation provisions beginning in the fifth lease year are subject to CPI being at least 0.5% for the preceding lease year. This transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2021, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Since re-opening in May 2020 and June 2020, respectively, HCBR and Hollywood Casino Perryville, the gaming properties GLPI owns and operates in its taxable REIT subsidiary, have generated strong financial results. Total first quarter 2021 net revenues and adjusted EBITDA from these properties exceeded prior-year levels, which were impacted by the temporary closures due to COVID-19, by $10.9 million and $6.8 million, respectively. On October 27, 2020, the Company entered into a series of definitive agreements pursuant to which a subsidiary of Bally's will acquire 100% of the equity interests in the Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ: CZR) (""Caesars"") subsidiary that currently operates Tropicana Evansville and the Company will reacquire the real property assets of Tropicana Evansville from Caesars for a cash purchase price of approximately $340.0 million. The Company also entered into a real estate purchase agreement with Bally's pursuant to which it will purchase the real estate assets of the Dover Downs Hotel & Casino, located in Dover, Delaware, which is currently owned and operated by Bally's, for a cash purchase price of approximately $144.0 million. At the close of these transactions, which are expected to occur in mid-2021 subject to regulatory approvals, the Tropicana Evansville and Dover Downs Hotel & Casino facilities will be added to the new Bally's Master Lease. The Company anticipates that the Bally's Master Lease will have an initial term of 15 years, with no purchase option, followed by four five-year renewal options (exercisable by Bally's) on the same terms and conditions. Rent under the Bally's Master Lease will be $40.0 million annually and is subject to an annual escalator of up to 2% determined in relation to the annual increase in the CPI. The Company's leases contain variable rent which is reset on varying schedules depending on the lease. In the aggregate, the portion of cash rents that are variable represented approximately 15% of GLPI's 2020 full year cash rental income. Of that 15% variable rent, approximately 29% resets every five years which is associated with the Penn Master Lease and the Casino Queen lease, 41% resets every two years and 30% resets monthly which is associated with the Penn Master Lease (of which approximately 51% is subject to a floor or $22.9 million annually for Hollywood Casino Toledo). The Company does not have any variable rent resets until 2022.In accordance with the rent deferral agreement that was signed in 2020 with Casino Queen, $2.1 million of rent was deferred due to the property's temporary closure in the first quarter of 2021. GLPI anticipates this amount will be collected at the closing of the HCBR transaction. The aggregate first quarter cash dividend of $0.65 per share was paid on March 23, 2021. Dividend On February 22, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors declared a first quarter cash dividend of $0.65 per share on the Company's common stock. The dividend was paid on March 23, 2021 to shareholders of record on March 9, 2021. Portfolio Update GLPI's primary business consists of acquiring, financing, and owning real estate property to be leased to gaming operators in triple-net lease arrangements. As of March 31, 2021, GLPI's portfolio consisted of interests in 48 gaming and related facilities, including approximately 35 acres of real estate at Tropicana Las Vegas and the Company's wholly-owned and operated Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge and Hollywood Casino Perryville, which are referred to as the ""TRS Segment"", the real property associated with 33 gaming and related facilities operated by Penn (excluding the Tropicana Las Vegas), the real property associated with 7 gaming and related facilities operated by Caesars, the real property associated with 4 gaming and related facilities operated by Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE: BYD), and the real property associated with the Casino Queen in East St. Louis, Illinois. These facilities are geographically diversified across 16 states and contain approximately 24.3 million square feet of improvements.

(5) In the third lease year the annual building base rent became $62.1 million and the annual land component was increased to $23.6 million. Building base rent shall be increased by 1.25% annually in the 5th and 6th lease year, 1.75% in the 7th and 8th lease year, and 2% in the 9th lease year and each year thereafter. On December 18, 2020, the Company and Caesars completed an Exchange Agreement (the ""Exchange Agreement"") with subsidiaries of Caesars in which Caesars transferred to the Company the real estate assets of Waterloo and Bettendorf in exchange for the transfer by the Company to Caesars of the real property assets of Tropicana Evansville, plus a cash payment of $5.7 million. In connection with the Exchange Agreement, the annual building base rent was increased to $62.5 million and the annual land component was increased to $23.7 million. Disclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures FFO, FFO per diluted common share, AFFO, AFFO per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Cash NOI, which are detailed in the reconciliation tables that accompany this release, are used by the Company as performance measures for benchmarking against the Company’s peers and as internal measures of business operating performance, which is used for a bonus metric. The Company believes FFO, FFO per diluted common share, AFFO, AFFO per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Cash NOI provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of the Company’s current business. This is especially true since these measures exclude real estate depreciation and we believe that real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. Cash NOI is rental and other property income, inclusive of rent credits recognized in connection with the Tropicana Las Vegas transaction, less cash property level expenses. Cash NOI excludes depreciation, the amortization of land rights, real estate general and administrative expenses, other non-routine costs and the impact of certain generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) adjustments to rental revenue, such as straight-line rent adjustments and non-cash ground lease income and expense. It is management's view that Cash NOI is a performance measure used to evaluate the operating performance of the Company’s real estate operations and provides investors relevant and useful information because it reflects only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an unleveraged basis. FFO, FFO per diluted common share, AFFO, AFFO per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Cash NOI are non-GAAP financial measures that are considered supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to GAAP measures. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding (gains) or losses from sales of property and real estate depreciation. We have defined AFFO as FFO excluding stock based compensation expense, the amortization of debt issuance costs, bond premiums and original issuance discounts, other depreciation, the amortization of land rights, straight-line rent adjustments and losses on debt extinguishment reduced by capital maintenance expenditures. We have defined Adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding interest, taxes on income, depreciation, (gains) or losses from sales of property, stock based compensation expense, straight-line rent adjustments, the amortization of land rights, and losses on debt extinguishment. For financial reporting and debt covenant purposes, the Company includes the amounts of non-cash rents earned in FFO, AFFO, and Adjusted EBITDA. Finally, we have defined Cash NOI as Adjusted EBITDA for the REIT excluding real estate general and administrative expenses and including stock based compensation expense and (gains) or losses from sales of property. FFO, FFO per diluted common share, AFFO, AFFO per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Cash NOI are not recognized terms under GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures: (i) do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP; (ii) should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities; and (iii) are not alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. In addition, these measures should not be viewed as an indication of our ability to fund all of our cash needs, including to make cash distributions to our shareholders, to fund capital improvements, or to make interest payments on our indebtedness. Investors are also cautioned that FFO, FFO per share, AFFO, AFFO per share, Adjusted EBITDA and Cash NOI, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate companies, including REITs, due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions.
