Using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, let us compare two gaming companies, Take-Two Interactive and Activision Blizzard, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.







Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO)



Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. is a developer, publisher and marketer of interactive entertainment. This interactive entertainment is designed for console gaming systems, personal computers, smartphones and tablets. The company publishes and develops its games through Rockstar Games, 2K, Private Division, Social Point, and Playdots.



TTWO generates revenue primarily through the sale of video game titles developed internally or video games developed by third parties. A core part of the company’s business strategy is to build entertainment franchises across different genres. TTWO seeks to create sequels for these franchises and explores incremental revenue opportunities through add-on content, virtual currency and in-game purchases.



Last month, TTWO announced robust fiscal fourth quarter results with GAAP net revenues of $839.4 million, up 10% year-over-year, while digitally delivered GAAP net revenue increased 19% to $753.3 million. 



At the end of Q4, TTWO had total net bookings of $784.5 million, up 8% year-over-year. The company defines net bookings as the net amount of products and services sold through retail or digitally and includes merchandise, licensing fees and in-game advertising.



For fiscal Q1, Take-Two projects net revenues to be between $730 million and $780 million. The company’s forecast for GAAP diluted net income is from $1.00 per share to $1.10 per share. For fiscal 2022, the company expects GAAP net revenue to be between $3.14 billion to $3.24 billion.



On June 2, the company acquired privately held Nordeus, a mobile games developer, in a cash and stock deal valued at $378 million. The company had acquired Social Point in 2017 and Playdots in 2020. The acquisitions coordinate well with the company’s strategic initiative of bolstering its mobile business. (See Take-Two Interactive stock analysis on TipRanks)



Take-Two Interactive’s Chairman and CEO Strauss Zelnick said at the earnings call, “We anticipate that the overall addressable market for our industry will be notably larger going forward than it was pre-pandemic. However, as the world returns to a new normal, we expect a moderation of the trends that benefited our industry over the past year.”



Zelnick added, “…we're highly optimistic about our growth trajectory, and we'll be making significant investments this year to enhance our enterprise in key areas such as creative talent, IT, and other infrastructure.”



The company said on its earnings call that for FY22, it plans to release 21 titles while in FY23 and FY24, TTWO expects to release over 40 titles, including 19 core releases. The company expects to generate 60% of its net bookings from the United States and the remainder from international markets.



To that end, the company wants to expand the distribution of its products in Asia and establish its presence in online gaming, especially in countries like China and South Korea. The company’s label, 2K Sports, has obtained a multiple year license from the NBA to develop on online version of its NBA simulation game in China, Taiwan, South Korea and Southeast Asia.



Following the announcement of the Nordeus acquisition, Robert W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian reiterated a Buy and a price target of $215 on the stock. Sebastian viewed the acquisition as “…providing Take-Two with greater scale in mobile franchises and development resources/expertise. We expect further industry consolidation in coming months and years given the fast pace of new game development and the increasing importance of mobile as a platform.”



Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 11 Buys, 6 Holds and 1 Sell. The TTWO average analyst price target of $213.91 implies approximately 16% upside potential to current levels.







Activision Blizzard (ATVI)



Activision Blizzard has three business segments, including Activision Publishing, Blizzard Entertainment and King Digital Entertainment.



Activision primarily generates revenues through games, in-game sales and licensing software to third parties. It offers content through both premium and free-to-play offerings. The company’s key product franchises include Call of Duty, Warcraft and Candy Crush.



These franchises delivered strong double-digit year-over-year rise in net bookings in Q1. In the first quarter, ATVI posted net revenues of $2.28 billion, a jump of 27.4% year-over-year. The company reported diluted earnings of $0.79 per share compared to diluted earnings of $0.65 per share in the same quarter last year.



For Q2, ATVI expects revenues of $2.14 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $0.91 per share. For the full year of 2021, the company anticipates net revenues of $8.37 billion with earnings of $3.42 per share.



The company’s strategy centers around its view that franchises completely owned by ATVI offer endless opportunities. Accordingly, the company is increasing its investment in its franchises and potential new franchises as it also faces competition from Chinese companies and platform providers.



Additionally, Activision plans to expand its creative and development teams. From the start of last year through to the end of 2022, it plans to hire more than 2,000 developers.



The company’s Call of Duty has been a successful franchise, as the number of players has grown to over 100 million players in the span of less than a year. The Call of Duty: Mobile continued to see strong year-over-year player engagement and investment in Q1. The franchise is also attracting millions of players in China. Later this year, the company intends to release its premium Call of Duty game with multiplayer and cooperative modes of play.



Further developing its franchises, the company’s King Digital Entertainment  has introduced new Candy Crush features and portfolio titles. King’s Crash Bandicoot: On the Run, a new mobile title launched in Q1 this year, has been downloaded 30 million times to date. (See Activision Blizzard stock analysis on TipRanks)



Activision intends to further expand its franchise pipeline in 2022 and beyond. This includes Diablo IV, Overwatch 2 and multiple Warcraft mobile titles that are expected to grow substantially. 



Activision Blizzard’s Chief Commercial Officer Armin Zerza said at its earnings call, “Regarding the fleet, our expanded teams are focused on delivering epic in-game and upfront content. This means that we'll continue to support our franchises with new in-game content, events and features all of which are critical elements of our business as we focus on keeping our communities engaged and drive year-round player investment.”



Last month, following ATVI’s recent changes to the content for Overwatch 2 and addition of new content, Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang reiterated a Buy and a price target of $110 on the stock. Yang said in a research note to investors, “We believe Activision Blizzard has entered a transition period to reposition its studio assets and development talents in response to aging franchises and new player engagement and monetization trends. So far, it has executed a series of successful turnaround for its core franchise, Call of Duty.”



Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 16 Buys. The ATVI average analyst price target of $117.13 implies approximately 21% upside potential to current levels.







Bottomline 



Analysts are cautiously optimistic about TTWO while they are bullish on ATVI. While TTWO is building a variety of franchises across different genres, ATVI is working on innovating its franchises that are wholly owned by the company. 



Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, ATVI seems to be a better buy.

(TTWO) revealed that it has acquired privately-held Nordeus, a mobile games developer in a cash and stock deal valued at $378 million.



Take-Two Interactive Software is a leading developer, publisher, and marketer of interactive entertainment for consumers across the world. Shares of the company were down 3.2% to close at $176.91 on June 2.



The acquisition will enhance Take-Two’s mobile business and sports offerings with the inclusion of Nordeus’ Top Eleven, a successful mobile soccer management game with over 240 million registered users.



The total deal consideration of $378 million includes an upfront payment of $225 million, which consists of cash and newly issued Take-Two common stock worth $90 million. In addition, the terms of the agreement include earn-out consideration dependent on Nordeus achieving EBITDA results above certain thresholds during the first two years, following the acquisition. (See Take-Two Interactive Software stock analysis on TipRanks)



Notably, the number of shares to be issued will be obtained by dividing $90 million by the weighted average closing price per share on the Nasdaq Global Select Market during the 30-day period, which ends on the second trading day before the closing date.



TTWO intends to fund the cash portion of the deal with available cash on the balance sheet.



The company acquired Social Point in 2017 and Playdots in 2020. The acquisitions go well with the company's strategic initiative to bolster its mobile business.



TTWO’s EVP and Head of Strategy and Independent Publishing, Michael Worosz, commented, “Our investment in Nordeus strengthens further Take-Two's mobile game business, is highly complementary to Social Point and Playdots, and broadens our sports portfolio with our first-ever soccer offerings.""



Following the acquisition, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Drew Crum maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $237 (40% upside potential) on the stock.



Crum said that he expects slight accretion from the announced acquisition, which will enhance Take-Two's presence in mobile and the sports category, especially in the soccer category. 



Overall, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys, 6 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $213.91 implies 20.9% upside potential from current levels. Shares of TTWO have jumped 36.8% over the past year.

Bulls were very much pressing their bets ahead of the holiday weekend. Sometimes their antics are on full display when you look at the S&P other times, you have to dig a bit deeper. In today’s article on breakout stocks to buy, I’ll highlight the areas that saw inflows this week and are catching my eye. Then, I’ll divulge three of my favorite stocks to trade. Semiconductors have been one of the growth engines for the tech sector over the past year. The growth fallout had them on the ropes, but they made a comeback this week that helped the Nasdaq return to an uptrend. Small-caps also woke up. The Russell 2000 Index outperformed the S&P 500 and is now sitting soundly on top of its 50-day moving average. Finally, momentum stocks are starting to rise from the ashes. 7 Best Stocks for Upcoming Grads to Buy and Hold Forever Together, these developments point to an improvement in market health and should give buyers the confidence to increase exposure. Here are three stocks to consider:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ:TTWO) Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) Let’s take a closer look at each setup. Breakout Stocks to Buy: Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Two weeks ago, I wouldn’t have touched TTWO. Its price chart was sinking, and better setups beckoned in Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA). But the response to its quarterly report changed everything. And, it leads the list of breakout stocks to buy. Price and volume surged, pushing TTWO from the lower end to the upper end of its three-month trading range in a single bound. Since then, we’ve carved out a clean high base formation. Day-by-day, we’re chewing through overhead supply while digesting the large gains. At the same time, overbought pressures are easing. Look for a break above $188.50 to signal the next up leg is beginning. Then, pull the trigger on bullish trades. With implied volatility in the tank following earnings, I like buying call verticals here. The Trade: Buy the August $190/$200 bull call spread for $3.00 You’re risking $3 to make $7. Snowflake (SNOW) Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Snowflake’s price chart has been decisively bearish all year long – until now. With this week’s strength, the once high-flying software company is now above its 50-day moving average. I didn’t find its earnings announcement all that interesting. But the market has spoken, and it’s a message I can’t ignore. Yesterday’s high-volume rally engulfed the prior five trading sessions. It also blasted through a resistance zone that was impenetrable for more than two months. This is actually the first breach of a ceiling we’ve seen since SNOW stock topped last December. I suspect many bears are running scared, given the change in character. 7 Best Stocks for Upcoming Grads to Buy and Hold Forever Since the trend reversal is still in its infancy, I prefer higher probability cash flow trades over shooting for the moon with an aggressive bet. If you think SNOW can stay above $200 for the next month, enter the following spread. The Trade: Sell the July $200/$195 bull put for 65 cents. You’re risking $4.35 to make 65 cents. However, the loss will be far less if you exit on a break of $200. Breakout Stocks to Buy: Newmont Mining (NEM) Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade The final entry in our breakout stocks is in an area that’s no stranger to strength this year – gold stocks. Inflation worries are carrying precious metals higher and gold miners have been big beneficiaries. After making a new 52-week high, NEM has been coiling quietly in a narrow range. Volume remains subdued. This signals we’re seeing garden variety profit-taking and not some mass exodus. The pause is allowing the 20-day moving average to play catch-up and overbought pressures to ease. Now is the time to prep trades for the next breakout. I like using $75 as the trigger point. The Trade: Buy the August $75/$80 bull call vertical for around $1.40. The spread cost will be slightly higher if you wait for NEM to take out resistance first.

(TTWO) rose 4% in Tuesday’s extended trading session after the company reported strong bookings and earnings figures in its fiscal fourth quarter. Take-Two is a video game holding company.The company reported total net bookings of $784.5 million which increased 8% from the year-ago period. Analysts were expecting net bookings of $663.8 million.Net Bookings from recurrent consumers accounted for 67% of total bookings which grew 17% from the year-ago quarter, driven by strong demand for mobile games.Meanwhile, earnings per share came in at $1.40 per share, above the consensus estimate of $0.66 per share.The company reported GAAP net revenue of $839.4 million, up 10% year-over-year, while digitally-delivered GAAP net revenue increased 19% to $753.3 million.Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said, “In Fiscal 2022, we plan to deliver an exciting array of offerings, including four immersive core releases, of which two will be from new franchises. In addition, we expect Fiscal 2022 to be our second consecutive year of Net Bookings in excess of $3 billion.”He further added, “With the strongest pipeline in our Company’s history, including many new releases planned for Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2024, we will be making significant investments this year to enhance our enterprise in key areas such as creative talent, IT, and other infrastructure. As we continue to grow our business, we believe that we will achieve sequential growth in Fiscal 2023 and establish new record levels of operating results over the next few years.” (See Take-Two stock analysis on TipRanks)For fiscal Q1, Take-Two projects net bookings to land in the $625 to $675 million range.For fiscal 2022, the company expects net bookings to be in the range of $3.2 to $3.3 billion.Following the fiscal Q4 earnings release, Robert W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian maintained the stock’s price target of $215 (28.2% upside potential) and a Buy rating.    Sebastian commented, “We continue to like Take-Two following F4Q results well above guidance/consensus, and with one of the industry's leading product portfolios benefiting from an increasingly digital/recurring revenue model.”The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating.
