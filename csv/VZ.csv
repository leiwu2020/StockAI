The deal will allow Verizon to enhance and expand its 5G Ultra Wideband coverage, network performance and user experience.



Notably, the technological solutions provided by Ericsson, including Massive MIMO, Ericsson Spectrum Sharing and Ericsson Cloud RAN, are part of the high-performing Ericsson Radio System portfolio to support 5G services. (See Verizon stock charts on TipRanks).



The President and Head of Ericsson in North America, Niklas Heuveldop, said, “This is a significant strategic partnership for both companies and what we’re most excited about is bringing the benefits of 5G to U.S. consumers, enterprises and the public sector.”



“With this new agreement, we will be able to continue driving innovation and widespread adoption of 5G,” said Kyle Malady, Chief Technology Officer for Verizon.



On July 7, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth reiterated a Buy rating on Verizon with a price target of $67 (upside potential of 18.5%).



Feinseth is of the opinion that Verizon stock has upside potential on account of ""growing opportunities"" in wireless and broadband. The analyst says Verizon continues to benefit from the ongoing rollout of its ""transformative"" 5G network.



Overall, the stock has a Hold consensus based on 2 Buys, 8 Holds and 1 Sell. The average Verizon price target of $60.11 implies 6.3% upside potential from current levels.



TipRanks’ Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool shows that confidence in Verizon is currently Very Positive, as the cumulative change in holdings across all 17 hedge funds that were active in the last quarter was an increase of 3.1 million shares.

The two have forged a strategic partnership to drive transformational solutions for the payment and e-commerce industry. The ultimate goal is to develop scalable solutions that create new experiences for people and businesses.



Additionally, they plan to collaborate in unlocking Internet of Things (IoT) sensor connectivity to power fintech and banking industries. Verizon Business and Mastercard also plan to make it easy for smartphones and connected devices to accept payments, thus allowing small businesses to benefit from hyper-automated and immersive commerce experiences.



Under the strategic partnership, Verizon’s 5G network and Mobile Edge computing will be integrated with Mastercard’s retail technology. Part of the plan is to reduce hardware requirements to enhance checkout in stores. (See Verizon stock charts on TipRanks)



The two companies are also working together to create new ways for people to consume physical and digital goods. Consequently, they are to come up with a digitally motivated network that enhances personalized consumer experiences.



Verizon will also leverage Mastercard’s Bill Pay Exchange to enable real-time communication and connection between consumers and billers. The result should be streamlined bills paid through digital banking channels.



“Through this collaboration, Mastercard and Verizon’s platforms, which connect billions of consumers, businesses, banks and governments around the world, will be a force in driving transformational change,” said Mastercard North America President Linda Kirkpatrick.



Last month, Redburn analyst Stephen Malcolm reiterated a Sell rating on Verizon with a $50 price target, implying 10.86% downside potential to current levels. According to the analyst, the company could disappoint on the revenue front.



Malcolm stated, “Verizon has an enviable track record for a scale telecom incumbent. But as an equity, it faces likely revenue disappointment versus over-bullish guidance, rising capital requirements and falling ROCE. With only a 5% true cash yield, there is insufficient room for error.”



Consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 2 Buys, 8 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average Verizon price target of $60.11 implies 7.17% upside potential to current levels.



VZ scores a 7 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, suggesting that the stock is likely to perform in line with market averages.

They didn’t disclose the terms of the settlement, but the deal ends the patent-infringement litigation between the companies. (See Verizon stock charts on TipRanks).



“Verizon is happy with the settlement reached with Huawei involving patent lawsuits. While terms of the settlement are not being disclosed, our team did an outstanding job bringing this protracted matter to a close. Our company continues to focus on what truly matters: providing millions of consumers and businesses with outstanding technology built on America's most reliable networks,” said Verizon spokesperson Rich Young.



Huawei sued Verizon, accusing the telecom operator of using its patented technology without paying for it, according to a Bloomberg report. Huawei filed two lawsuits against Verizon. The telecom behemoth denied infringing on Huawei patents and was prepared to defend itself in court.



A trial had just begun into one of Huawei’s lawsuits against Verizon, but the companies agreed to resolve their differences before the case could play out fully in court.



Last week, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth reiterated a Buy rating on Verizon stock and assigned it a price target of $67. Feinseth’s price target suggests 19.32% upside potential.



The analyst sees Verizon’s share price benefiting from the growing opportunities in wireless and broadband. Additionally, Feinseth observes that Verizon continues to benefit from what he describes as “transformative” 5G network rollout.



Consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 2 Buys, 8 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average Verizon price target of $60.11 implies 7.05% upside potential to current levels.



According to TipRanks’ Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool, confidence in VZ is currently Very Positive. The cumulative change in holdings across all 24 funds that were active in the last quarter was an increase of 17.7 million shares.

The deal with ZHD Group comes after the telecom giant agreed to sell its Verizon Media division, which houses the Yahoo business. That transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2021. (See Verizon stock chart on TipRanks).



ZHD Group has been making royalty payments to Verizon to use the Yahoo brand. Under the new agreement, ZHD Group will acquire perpetual rights to the Yahoo brand in Japan, and the royalty payments will cease. The new agreement is expected to go into effect upon the closing of the pending Verizon Media sale.



With perpetual rights, ZHD Group hopes to have greater flexibility in its use of the Yahoo brand in developing its businesses. ZHD Group says Yahoo Japan will maintain its relationship with Verizon Media after the current license arrangement ends.



In June, Redburn analyst Stephen Malcolm initiated coverage on Verizon stock with a Sell rating and a price target of $50. Malcolm’s price target suggests 11.41% downside potential.



""Verizon has an enviable track record for a scale telecom incumbent. But as an equity, it faces likely revenue disappointment versus over-bullish guidance, rising capital requirements and falling ROCE. With only a 5% true cash yield, there is insufficient room for error,” commented Malcolm. 



Consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 2 Buys, 8 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average Verizon price target of $59.44 implies 5.32% upside potential to current levels.



VZ scores a 9 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.
