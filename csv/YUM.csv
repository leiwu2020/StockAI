Brands (YUM) is acquiring Dragontail Systems Limited as it seeks to enhance its global delivery capabilities. The acquisition will also allow the company to integrate new technology talent. Additionally, it should be able to scale Dragontail’s artificial intelligence (AI) order management and delivery technology globally. Under the terms of the deal, Yum! Brands is to pay A$93.5 million in cash. The acquisition should close in the third quarter, subject to Australian Federal Court approval. Dragontail shareholders will also have to authorize the takeover. With the acquisition, Yum! Brands will gain access to a unique delivery platform designed to optimize and manage the entire food preparation process. Dragontail's AI-based solution automates kitchen flow and the process of dispensing deliveries. In addition, the order flow system allows consumers to track their orders once payment is made. (See Yum! Brands stock analysis on TipRanks) “With Dragontail, we expect to tap into the power of AI to accelerate and further enhance our delivery technology capabilities, especially at Pizza Hut, and optimize the end-to-end food preparation process,” said CFO Chris Turner. While Dragontail’s platform is currently on offer in 10 countries, Yum! Brands intends to scale it and offer it worldwide once the deal closes. Completion of the transaction will bring to three the number of acquisitions the restaurant chain has made this year. In addition to the acquisition, Yum! Brands is poised for tremendous growth in Latin America, reports Investing.com. Through the Pizza Hut brand, the pie purveyor sees solid growth south of the border, with stores more than doubling. According to Investing.com, Pizza Hut opened its 1000th location in Guadalajara as the expansion in Latin America gathers pace. Plans to open and renovate more locations are in different stages of development. Cowen analyst Andrew Charles has affirmed Yum! Brands' bright outlook with comparable store sales expected to grow on the back of accelerated store development. Charles stated, “We believe the brand has room to sustain digital's momentum to further enhance unit economics (described as 3-5 year cash paybacks) and accelerate development to ~6% annually in 2022 & beyond for a brand that skews to emerging markets.” The analyst has since reiterated a Hold rating on the stock with a $116 price target implying 3.41% downside potential to current levels. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 8 Buy and 9 Hold ratings. The average analyst price target of $124.27 implies 3.48% upside potential to current levels.

Brands’ (NYSE: YUM) Taco Bell is opening its first U.S. digital-only location in the middle of New York City’s Times Square. What Happened: The new Taco Bell Cantina opens today within the historic Paramount Building and will provide visitors with 10 kiosks that enable self-ordering. The location has a separate double-door entrance for customers picking up meals they ordered ahead of time via the Taco Bell app. Taco Bell has also introduced a new menu item exclusive to this location: The Bell Apple Freeze, a Green Apple Freeze swirled with a sweet cherry apple flavor. For those seeking a more invigorating beverage, the Cantina is also offering alcohol selections for customers ages 21 and over.

The chain has more than 200 in the greater New York metro area and plans to build another 25 in the region this year. According to the company, the focus on this region accounts for roughly 10% of Taco Bell’s overall development mix The Times Square location will offer on-premise seating for customers to leisurely enjoy their meals. In an interview with the financial trade journal PYMNTS, Taco Bell President and Global Chief Operating Officer Mike Grams said the chain was eager to merge the convenience of digital ordering with the traditional pleasure of indoor dining. “There are two critical elements that will work together harmoniously across our Taco Bell brand,” said Grams. “It’s the idea of merging technology and mobile convenience with the human connection we all crave — especially when many of our fans are digitally native to begin with. By staying flexible in our restaurant formats and features, we’ll be able to continue creating unique environments and experiences for any customer.” Related Link: Stock Wars: Yum! Brands Vs.
