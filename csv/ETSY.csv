As per the U.S. Census Bureau’s most recent data, U.S. E-commerce sales grew 39% year-over-year to $196.7 billion in the first quarter of 2021 and accounted for 13.4% of overall U.S. retail sales.



The surge in buying-from-home has not just benefitted E-commerce giants like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), but more niche players, including Etsy (ETSY), Chewy (CHWY), and Wayfair (W), have also gained. In this favorable growth environment for E-retailers, pet adoption and pet owners' willingness to spend more on their pets led to escalated demand for pet food and wellness products and services.



According to a Grand View Research report, the global pet food market was valued at $83.02 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.5% through 2019 to 2025.



Therefore, given Chewy’s “compelling value proposition, product innovation, and the predictable nature of about 70% of sales,” Needham analyst Anna Andreeva initiated coverage of the U.S. online retailer of pet food, pet supplies, and medications with a Hold rating.



The analyst believes the recent collaboration with Freshpet (FRPT) has exposed Chewy to the freshly prepared pet food space as well. Therefore, Andreeva estimates that sales from the Freshpet partnership and Chewy’s premium proprietary brand, Tylee’s, together can inflate the company’s TAM (total available market) by $600 million to $1 billion. Notably, Freshpet is an established manufacturer of natural fresh meals and treats for dogs and cats.



Furthermore, “with its high-touch customer care model,” Chewy is expected to be the pioneer in this category soon, with the new fresh products likely to be shipped in the coming quarters and initially be commercialized across three regions covering about 60% of Chewy’s client base.



Andreeva considers durable U.S. pet market tailwinds along with TAM expansion as strong opportunities for the company. Additionally, the company’s innovative products that transformed it from a provider of food and treats, to providing a multidimensional customer experience including food, treats, personalized accessories, health care, and services seem encouraging.



From a financial perspective, the analyst believes that the company is moving towards its long-term gross margin target of 25% - 28%, displaying a 5-year average of 20.7% preceding 2020, and 25.5% in 2020. Rising market share in higher-margin verticals, pricing stability in the controlled promotional environment during the pandemic, and normalization of freight & logistics costs were cited as reasons for the expansion.



Furthermore, according to Andreeva, although acceleration in gross margin gains by 420 bps was experienced in 1Q21, the same is likely to moderate for the remainder of the year on rising freight & logistics charges as well as increased activity in promotions.



Notably, the analyst estimates gross margin to come in at 27.2%, up 170 bps year-over-year in 2021, while at 27.9%, up 70 bps for 2022. (See Chewy stock charts on TipRanks)



Overall, the analyst commented, “With impressive speed of innovation and high quality of execution, we see Chewy as well positioned in the durable pet space to gain new customers, drive retention through its subscription program and capture greater wallet share through expanding products and services as the company strives to be a one-stop destination for all pet needs. However, new customer ads slowed to below a pre-Covid level in 1Q21, and company faces a challenging near-term operating environment that includes higher spending on wages & benefits, and supply shortages that began in 2020.”



Therefore, considering the shares are fully valued at current levels, the analyst assigns a Hold rating.



On TipRanks, Chewy has a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating based on 7 Buy and 2 Hold ratings. The average Chewy price target is $110.38, representing 12-month upside potential of 35.9%.



TipRanks’ Stock Investors tool shows that investors currently have a Very Positive stance on Chewy, with 9.4% of investors maintaining portfolios on TipRanks increasing their exposure to CHWY stock over the past 30 days. Shares have increased 56.5% over the past year.

(ETSY) announced a $1.63 billion acquisition of the fashion reseller Depop, vastly expanding its exposure to youth clothing and apparel markets. The deal will close in Q3 of FY21. (See ETSY stock analysis on TipRanks) 



Darren Aftahi of Roth Capital Partners published an analysis on the matter, stating that Etsy will increase its stake in the Gen-Z world of social commerce, as Depop uses many influencers to promote inventory content on social media. Aftahi assigned a Buy rating on the stock, and declared a price target of $245, reflecting a potential upside of 45.65% from Monday’s closing price.  



Aftahi was upbeat about Depop’s acquisition, noting that it is “said to be the second most visited site for Gen-Z’s in the U.S.,” and that 90% of its active users are below the age of 26. Depop has high consumer engagement, with 49% of buyers returning for more purchases. He also wrote that in regard to market growth, second-hand apparel is set to outpace fast fashion by two-to-one.  



Depop, however, does not come without its risks, as the resale apparel market currently has high levels of competition. Furthermore, Etsy itself is slowly losing its unique leadership position in the handmade craft industry, as Amazon Handmade has entered into the niche market, Aftahi mentioned.  



The analyst was critical of Etsy, saying that the company faces a double-edged sword in regard to its business model. Its policies mandating sustainability and handmade goods could limit future growth. On the other hand, shifting away from those policies may push away otherwise loyal buyers and sellers toward the website's competitors.  



On TipRanks, ETSY is calculated to be a Strong Buy, based on 12 Buy, 1 Hold, and 1 Sell ratings. The average analyst ETSY price target is $222.92, representing a potential 12-month upside of 32.44%.

(ETSY) has inked a cash deal to acquire Depop, a privately-held marketplace for unique fashion with 30 million registered users across 150 countries, for $1.625 billion.



ETSY operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world. Shares of the company were up 7.2% to close at $175.14 on June 2.



Per the terms of the deal, ETSY will pay $1.625 billion in cash after adjusting for Depop's working capital, transaction expenses, cash, debt, and certain deferred and unvested equity of Depop's management and employees. Notably, Depop will continue to operate as a standalone marketplace headed by its existing team.



The deal is expected to be accretive to Etsy's top-line growth and will be slightly dilutive to Etsy's adjusted EBITDA margin. (See Etsy, Inc. stock analysis on TipRanks)



The addition of Depop will enhance ETSY’s total addressable market (TAM) in the apparel sector, specifically in the fast-growing resale space, as well as widen its reach into the Gen Z consumer with differentiated brand strength and strong user engagement, the company said.



The acquisition is expected to close during the third quarter of 2021.  Upon completion of the deal, Etsy will function through three highly differentiated eCommerce brands: Etsy, Reverb, and Depop. 



ETSY intends to utilize its available liquidity to finance the deal. As of March 31, 2021, Etsy had $2 billion in total liquidity which includes $1.8 billion in cash and investments and an undrawn $200 million revolving credit facility.



ETSY CEO Josh Silverman stated, ""We are simply thrilled to be adding Depop—what we believe to be the resale home for Gen Z consumers—to the Etsy family. Depop is a vibrant, two-sided marketplace with a passionate community, a highly-differentiated offering of unique items, and we believe significant potential to further scale.”



Silverman further added, “We see significant opportunities for shared expertise and growth synergies across what will now be a tremendous 'house of brands' portfolio of individually distinct, and very special, ecommerce brands.""



After the deal announcement, Canaccord Genuity analyst Maria Ripps reiterated a Buy rating and a price target of $270 (54.2% upside potential) on the stock.



Ripps commented that the deal enhances ETSY’s existing portfolio of brands adding Depop’s strong base of Gen Z end consumers to its user base. It also extends the company’s foothold in the rapidly growing second-hand apparel market.



Overall, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys, 1 Hold, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $224.83 implies 28.4% upside potential from current levels. Shares of ETSY have jumped 117% over the past year.
