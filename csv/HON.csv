Shares of the diversified technology and manufacturing company are up around 4.1% year-to-date, closing at $221.32 on July 2. A strong Q2 earnings report might be the catalyst to steer the stock back to its 52-week high of $234.02. Let’s take a closer look at what the Street expects when the company reports Q2 earnings.



Wall Street analysts expect Honeywell to report Q2 earnings per share of $1.96. Meanwhile, the company has guided for EPS of between $1.86 and $1.96. Analysts expect revenues of $8.61 billion against the company’s guidance of between $8.4 and $8.7 billion.



In the first quarter, Honeywell delivered double-digit sales growth in Safety and Productivity Solutions as it returned to growth in its Building Technologies segment. Earnings per share came in at $1.92, above analyst estimates of $1.79 a share. Revenue also topped consensus estimates, coming in at $8.45 billion versus $8.06 billion expected. (See Honeywell stock analysis on TipRanks)



Factors To Look For



Following a first-quarter report that exceeded expectations, investors are waiting to see whether the company was able to sustain growth across its business segments. The Warehouse and Workflow Solutions segments grew by double-digit in Q1, while the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) business, Advanced Materials, and Connected Software segments also performed well.



It will also be interesting to see whether segment margin expansion in Aerospace and Honeywell Building Technologies continue in Q2, as was the case in Q1. Cost actions taken in 2020 allowed Honeywell to post margin expansion on Safety And Productivity Solutions in Q1, and investors are waiting to see if the momentum continued in Q2.



While delivering the Q1 results CEO, Darius Adamczyk reiterated that Honeywell's offerings in growing markets, like life sciences, are gaining traction while the hardest hit industries are on a recovery trajectory. The executive also affirmed a Research and Development investment directed towards products that improve environmental and social outcomes for customers. It will be interesting to see the progress made on this front in Q2.



Recent Developments



Late last month, Honeywell confirmed plans to partner with Trane Technologies. The two are joining forces to accelerate the transition to a next-generation environmental-friendly refrigerant. Part of the plan involves testing Honeywell’s Solstice N41 (R-466A), a non-flammable alternative to R-410A.



Vice president and General Manager of Honeywell Fluorine Products, Ken West, stated, ""Solstice N41 is a great option for both commercial and residential end users. This next step with Trane solidifies our confidence in moving toward industry adoption of R-466A.""



The continuous testing, research, and development of Solstice (R-466A) support Trane Technologies' and Honeywell’s push to improve the carbon footprint. As the two seek to replace R-410A, they should balance the environmental impact, safety, efficiency, and affordability.



Additionally, Honeywell has launched a battery energy storage system to help users forecast and optimize energy costs. Honeywell's Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) Platform is the new system that will allow organizations to forecast and optimize energy used while leveraging supervisory control and analytics.



The BESS Platform is ideal for a wide range of commercial and industrial companies as well as independent power producers and utilities. It also leverages the best practices, including energy arbitrage and demand management.



In May, the Peruvian Navy selected HON as its strategic partner for enhancing search and rescue capabilities. The Navy will use Honeywell's next-generation satellite tracking technology to monitor and perform rescue operations and locate important assets.



“Our global tracking solutions help governments and emergency response teams save hundreds of lives around the globe each year, and our MEOSAR system can help the Peruvian Navy save lives by quickly identifying aircraft, ships and people in distress regardless of how remote their location is,” stated Kenneth Deville, GM of Honeywell’s Global Tracking business.



Honeywell is to provide the Peruvian army with its Middle Earth Orbit Search and Rescue ground station system. The system includes satellite antennas, rescue control systems, and computer equipment.



In June, Wolfe Research analyst Nigel Coe reiterated a Buy rating on Honeywell but raised the price target to $239 from $235, implying 8% upside potential to current levels.



Overall, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 8 Buys and 5 Holds. The average Honeywell price target of $238.18 implies 7.62% upside potential from current levels.

Shares of the multinational conglomerate operating in aerospace, building technologies, performance materials, and safety and productivity solutions have jumped 53.6% over the past year. (See HON stock analysis on TipRanks)



Honeywell said its researchers will collaborate with Indian scientists at the Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO) and with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research–Indian Institute of Petroleum (CSIR–IIP) to test and validate the suitability of adsorbents for oxygen production in India.



Dr. Akshay Bellare, President of Honeywell India, commented, ""Honeywell is committed to helping India address the current pandemic and is making every effort to find meaningful ways to engage with the Government of India in the fight to save lives.”



J.P. Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa recently reiterated a Buy rating on the stock.



Tusa thinks Honeywell has robust growth potential which remains completely underrated. He said that the several growth initiatives at Honeywell ""are on the cusp of bearing fruit in the middle of key early-stage secular trends.” 



Overall, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 8 Buys and 5 Holds. The HON average analyst price target of $238.18 implies 5.8% upside potential from current levels.

Their electrified power sources will help provide cleaner, quieter and more environmentally-friendly transportation in and between cities. The partners plan to deliver flight test configurations of the electric propulsion systems in 2022. The companies said they had initiated talks with potential customers about integrating the new electric propulsion systems into their aircraft. They are initially targeting aircraft used to deliver packages and fly passengers across cities, which comprise a segment called urban air mobility (UAM). Denso is a specialist in auto components and technology that supplies nearly every vehicle on the road today. Honeywell operates a diversified business, and its aerospace division builds engines, mechanical systems, and electronics for aircraft. ""Honeywell technologies have helped power human flight for more than 100 years, and as electric propulsion for aircraft takes shape, Honeywell will be at the forefront,” commented Dave Marinick, president of Engines & Power Systems, Honeywell Aerospace. In addition to making money selling these systems, Honeywell and Denso count on the partnership to reduce the environmental impact of their operations. Both companies have committed to make their operations carbon neutral by 2035. (See Honeywell stock analysis on TipRanks) JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa reiterated a Buy rating on Honeywell stock but did not assign it a price target. Tusa believes investors have not fully understood Honeywell’s growth potential. “Investors underappreciate the many growth initiatives Honeywell has embedded in its portfolio that are on the cusp of bearing fruit in the middle of key early stage secular trends,"" noted Tusa. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 8 Buy and 5 Hold ratings. The average analyst price target of $237.82 implies 5.70% upside potential to current levels. HON scores a “Perfect 10” on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, implying the stock will likely outperform the market.

The company is working with advisers as it weighs alternatives, which could also include a commercial partnership with a major manufacturer, they said.Aspen Tech makes software for companies in industries such as chemicals, manufacturing, energy, metals and mining, its website shows. Shares of the company rose as much as 2.9% Wednesday, hitting the highest intraday level in two weeks. They were up 1.1% at 9:49 a.m. in New York, giving Aspen Tech a market value of $9.5 billion.The company has long been considered an attractive takeover target for big industrial companies looking to expand in software. However, high price expectations and management reluctance have been hurdles for a full sale over the years despite interest from potential acquirers, the people said.Deliberations are ongoing and may not lead to a transaction, the people said. A representative for Bedford, Massachusetts-based Aspen Tech declined to comment.Industrial firms have been shifting their focus from machinery to technology and automation. Last year, Aveva Group Plc agreed to acquire industrial-software maker Osisoft for about $5 billion, while Emerson Electric Co. agreed to buy Open Systems International Inc. for $1.6 billion.Software companies also have sometimes sought investments from potential buyers, including industrial companies. In 2018, Rockwell Automation Inc. agreed to make a $1 billion equity investment in industrial software company PTC Inc. as part of a strategic partnership, according to a statement at the time.Honeywell International Inc., which has been seeking to marry software capabilities with its industrial know-how, agreed in December to acquire Sparta Systems for $1.3 billion to gain technology used in the life sciences industry. The company said in April it’s transferring its listing to the Nasdaq as it seeks to stress its technology focus.(Updates with share movement in third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d90e1009759b127b0a71b3be9ae4d25059edf2784627e40f0eb40386c53dd97d
