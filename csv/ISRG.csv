The robotics products and surgical equipment provider reported non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.52, topping consensus estimates of $2.64 per share. Intuitive Surgical’s (ISRG) CEO, Gary Guthart said, “We are pleased with this quarter’s performance. Our performance reflects customers choosing Intuitive as COVID eases.” ISRG said that the use of its minimally invasive procedure, the da Vinci procedure, increased 16% year-on-year while the company shipped 26% more da Vinci Surgical Systems in 1Q compared to the same quarter last year. The growth in revenues was driven by a rise in system placements and da Vinci procedures. (See Intuitive Surgical stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the earnings, BTIG analyst Ryan Zimmerman reiterated a Hold on the stock. Zimmerman said in a note to investors, “Comments that provide particular optimism out of the call include: 1) Procedures grew through the Q (vs. a rapid inflection in March), coupled with a broad recovery across procedure types… 2) Capital demand at hospitals outpaced expectations again, proving that hospitals’ finances are potentially stronger than assumed; and 3) ISRG provided guidance which we think is conservative given the assumptions underpinning it (discussed below)” ISRG shares have rallied 13.4% in the past five days. Overall, consensus among analysts is that ISRG is a Moderate Buy, based on 6 Buys and 6 Holds. The average analyst price target of $877.10 implies downside potential of about 1.6% to current levels. According to the TipRanks Smart Score system, ISRG scores a 9 out of 10, indicating that the stock is likely to outperform market expectations.

It joins the likes of Medtronic Plc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. among health firms to eclipse the $100 billion mark. CVS Health Corp. ended Wednesday’s trading just above the threshold too.Intuitive has soared nearly 80% in the past year as investors piled back into companies seen as likely to weather the storm of Covid-19, giving it a market value of about $106 billion. Strong results from the company alongside medical devices heavyweights Abbott Laboratories and Edwards Lifesciences Corp. have signaled to investors that elective surgeries are returning more rapidly than expected as the U.S. economy reopens.The company’s stronger than expected first-quarter robotic systems installations provided more evidence that hospital expenditures remain “quite robust,” signaling that medical centers are prepared for impending volume recovery, Deutsche Bank analyst Imron Zafar wrote in a note to clients.The demand “will be buoyed by a multi-quarter tailwind from the sizeable backlog of deferred surgeries and delayed diagnoses/referrals across key segments like prostatectomy and colorectal,” Zafar continued.Most analysts covering the company are also optimistic. More than half have a buy recommendation on the stock, eight research firms have a neutral stance and only two have a sell rating, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.(Updates share movement throughout.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=95466a73268b1f370330c5477c72e65237a8e5a2150926058e65109281a672cf
