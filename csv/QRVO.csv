That network is changing, as the new 5G technology rolls out around the world. China is leading the way, with the Europe and the US working to catch up. Successfully switching the major wireless networks to 5G will bring a host of advantages: higher connection speeds, lower latency, clearer signals, and far better data carrying capacity.



Carrying capacity is likely the key to success for 5G. The new networks will permit larger and faster data transfers, allowing technologies from the Internet of Things to autonomous vehicles to mature. It will be a world-changing event, and it is taking shape right before our eyes.



As 5G networks expand, and more customers, both business and personal, switch over, the companies that supply the gear will stand to boom. 5G will require everything from new silicon semiconductor chips to signal testing equipment to smartphone handsets. Radio frequency finding technology is involved, as well as more venerable tech, such as connecting cables.



With this in mind, using the TipRanks platform, we’ve located two stocks that stand to gain from the 5G revolution that is building up. They hold different niches in the wireless tech sector, one in chips and the other in microwave networks.



Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO)



We’ll start with Qorvo, a large-cap semiconductor chip company based in Greensboro, North Carolina. Qorvo saw $3.24 billion in total revenues for the calendar year 2020, making it a mid-sized competitor in the chip industry. The company’s main product focus is chipsets for use in radio frequency transmitters – a key component of broadband and wifi networks.



Qorvo has been neck-deep in 5G for several years now, producing RF systems capable of operating at 5G’s frequencies – and making the new wireless a reality. The company has been developing sub-6 GHz and cmWave/mmWave wireless infrastructure products that are needed to roll out the systems. Qorvo’s product line also includes a full portfolio of RF devices, such as phase shifters, switchers, and integrated modules, that are necessary for supporting networks – and that work with 5G.



In the most recent quarterly release, for Q4 of fiscal 2021, Qorvo edged over the expectations and showed total revenue of $1.73 billion. This marked the third consecutive quarter of revenues exceeding $1 billion. The top line was up 36% year-over-year. The revenue print was driven by the company’s Mobile Products segment, which brought in $808 million of the revenue total, an increase of 45% yoy.



All of this caught the attention of Needham's Rajvindra Gill, who titled his latest report on this stock, ‘5G Momentum Continues.’ The 5-star analyst wrote: “Mobile Products continues to be driven by 5G handset content increases and expected higher volumes in CY21. Infrastructure & Defense is expected to see a better 2H21 after a slower 1H start, with more MIMO deployments in the US expected. Utilization is expected to rise over the year, which will help sustain margins.”



To this end, Gill rates QRVO shares a Buy, and his $245 price target implies a one-year upside of 33%. (To watch Gill’s track record, click here)



Overall, this stock has a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 12 reviews with a breakdown of 10 to 2 in Buy versus Hold. The shares are priced at $184.27 and the average price target of $218.83 suggests ~19% upside in the next 12 months. (See QRVO stock analysis on TipRanks)







Aviat Networks (AVNW)



Next up, Aviat, is a provider of microwave networking solutions. The company’s products include hardware – such as microwave routers and switches, trunking units, and indoor and outdoor radios – as well as software network management, stabilization, and automation. Aviat’s customer base include both public and private entities: the State of Oregon, the City of San Jose, Verizon, and US Cellular, to name just a few.



Aviat is deeply involved in the development and rollout of 5G networks. The company’s networking solutions are integral to public expansion of rural broadband, a market that is benefitting from heavy governmental funding.



The company is not just expanding 5G in the US. Aviat in April announced an agreement with Africell, a mobile provider with over 12 million subscribers across Africa, for provision of a ‘5G-ready end-to-end disaggregated transmission network’ that will cross international borders on the continent.



In early May, the company reported its fiscal Q3 earnings, with both EPS and revenue beating the consensus estimates. EPS, at 49 cents, was 22 cents better than expected, a beat of 81%, while the $66.4 million in revenue was 5% better than expected.



AVNW shares have been gaining steam in the 12 months, rising ~418%. Yet, Northland analyst Tim Savageaux believes there’s still some fuel left in the tank. The 5-star analyst rates AVNW an as Outperform (i.e. Buy) and his $45 price target implies room for a 16% upside from current levels. (To watch Savageaux’s track record, click here)



“We believe these customers [5G and rural broadband] could contribute ~$100M over 5 years with initial orders already in hand, with other 5G driven opptys in the US and globally potentially adding to that,” Savageaux opined.



Looking at the rest of this year, Savageaux added, “The company noted positive book to bill and backlog remaining above $200M, leading us to increase our FY21 revenue to ~$270M implying … 13% revenue growth for the year.”



Some stocks fly under the radar, and AVNW is one of those. Savageaux’s is the only review on record for this small-cap network provider. (See AVNW stock analysis at TipRanks)

Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this earnings release contains some or all of the following non-GAAP financial measures: (i) non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, (ii) non-GAAP operating income and operating margin, (iii) non-GAAP net income, (iv) non-GAAP net income per diluted share, (v) non-GAAP operating expenses (research and development; selling, general and administrative), (vi) free cash flow, (vii) EBITDA, (viii) non-GAAP return on invested capital (ROIC), and (ix) net debt or positive net cash. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures is either adjusted from GAAP results to exclude certain expenses or derived from multiple GAAP measures, which are outlined in the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” tables, attached, and the “Additional Selected Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations” tables, attached. In managing Qorvo's business on a consolidated basis, management develops an annual operating plan, which is approved by our Board of Directors, using non-GAAP financial measures. In developing and monitoring performance against this plan, management considers the actual or potential impacts on these non-GAAP financial measures from actions taken to reduce costs with the goal of increasing gross margin and operating margin. In addition, management relies upon these non-GAAP financial measures to assess whether research and development efforts are at an appropriate level, and when making decisions about product spending, administrative budgets, and other operating expenses. Also, we believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors and enable investors to analyze the results of operations in the same way as management. We have chosen to provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of our operating results, to assess our liquidity and capital position and to analyze financial performance excluding the effect of expenses unrelated to operations, certain non-cash expenses and stock-based compensation expense, which may obscure trends in Qorvo's underlying performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures offer an additional view of Qorvo's operations that, when coupled with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of Qorvo's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting Qorvo's business. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our rationale for using these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as their impact on the presentation of Qorvo's operations, are outlined below: Non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin. Non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring related charges and certain non-cash expenses. We believe that exclusion of these costs in presenting non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin facilitates a useful evaluation of our historical performance and projected costs and the potential for realizing cost efficiencies. We view amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names, and customer relationships, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities, determined at the time of an acquisition, rather than ongoing costs of operating Qorvo’s business. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangible assets is a static expense, which is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. Although we exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets from these non-GAAP financial measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase price accounting and contribute to revenue generation.We believe that presentation of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin and other non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of stock-based compensation expense assists management and investors in evaluating the period-over-period performance of Qorvo's ongoing operations because (i) the expenses are non-cash in nature, and (ii) although the size of the grants is within our control, the amount of expense varies depending on factors such as short-term fluctuations in stock price volatility and prevailing interest rates, which can be unrelated to the operational performance of Qorvo during the period in which the expense is incurred and generally are outside the control of management. Moreover, we believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense in presenting non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin and other non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors to understand the impact of the expensing of stock-based compensation to Qorvo's gross profit and gross margins and other financial measures in comparison to prior periods. We also believe that the adjustments to profit and margin related to restructuring related charges and certain non-cash expenses do not constitute part of Qorvo's ongoing operations and therefore the exclusion of these items provides management and investors with better visibility into the actual revenue and actual costs required to generate revenues over time and facilitates a useful evaluation of our historical and projected performance. We believe disclosure of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin has economic substance because the excluded expenses do not represent continuing cash expenditures and, as described above, we have little control over the timing and amount of the expenses in question. Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin. Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring related charges, acquisition and integration related costs, loss (gain) on assets, start-up costs and certain non-cash expenses. We believe that presentation of a measure of operating income and operating margin that excludes amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense is useful to both management and investors for the same reasons as described above with respect to our use of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin. We believe that restructuring related charges, acquisition and integration related costs, loss (gain) on assets, start-up costs and certain non-cash expenses do not constitute part of Qorvo's ongoing operations and therefore, the exclusion of these costs provides management and investors with better visibility into the actual costs required to generate revenues over time and facilitates a useful evaluation of our historical and projected performance. We believe disclosure of non-GAAP operating income and operating margin has economic substance because the excluded expenses are either unrelated to ongoing operations or do not represent current cash expenditures. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share exclude the effects of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring related charges, acquisition and integration related costs, loss (gain) on assets, start-up costs, certain non-cash expenses, loss on debt extinguishment, (gain) loss on investments, impairment on investment, other (income) expense and also reflect an adjustment of income taxes. The income tax adjustment primarily represents the use of research and development tax credit carryforwards, deferred tax expense (benefit) items not affecting taxes payable, adjustments related to the deemed and actual repatriation of historical foreign earnings, non-cash expense (benefit) related to uncertain tax positions and other items unrelated to the current fiscal year or that are not indicative of our ongoing business operations. We believe that presentation of measures of net income and net income per diluted share that exclude these items is useful to both management and investors for the reasons described above with respect to non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin and non-GAAP operating income and operating margin. We believe disclosure of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share has economic substance because the excluded expenses are either unrelated to ongoing operations or do not represent current cash expenditures. Non-GAAP operating expenses (research and development and selling, general and administrative). Non-GAAP research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and certain non-cash expenses (primarily acquisition and integration related costs). We believe that presentation of measures of these operating expenses that exclude amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense is useful to both management and investors for the same reasons as described above with respect to our use of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin. We believe that acquisition and integration related costs and certain non-cash expenses do not constitute part of Qorvo's ongoing operations and therefore, the exclusion of these costs provides management and investors with better visibility into the actual costs required to generate revenues over time and facilitates a useful evaluation of our historical and projected performance. We believe disclosure of these non-GAAP operating expenses has economic substance because the excluded expenses are either unrelated to ongoing operations or do not represent current cash expenditures.

Qorvo defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities during the period minus property and equipment expenditures made during the period, and free cash flow margin is calculated as free cash flow as a percentage of revenue. We use free cash flow as a supplemental financial measure in our evaluation of liquidity and financial strength. Management believes that this measure is useful as an indicator of our ability to service our debt, meet other payment obligations and make strategic investments. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Additionally, our definition of free cash flow is limited, in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our entire statement of cash flows. EBITDA. Qorvo defines EBITDA as earnings before interest expense and interest income, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and intangible amortization. Management believes that this measure is useful to evaluate our ongoing operations and as a general indicator of our operating cash flow (in conjunction with a cash flow statement which also includes among other items, changes in working capital and the effect of non-cash charges). Non-GAAP ROIC. Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor by measuring the effectiveness of our operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. We use ROIC to track how much value we are creating for our shareholders. Non-GAAP ROIC is calculated by dividing annualized non-GAAP operating income, net of an adjustment for income taxes (as described above), by average invested capital. Average invested capital is calculated by subtracting the average of the beginning balance and the ending balance of current liabilities (excluding the current portion of long-term debt and other short-term financings) from the average of the beginning balance and the ending balance of net accounts receivable, inventories, other current assets, net property and equipment and a cash amount equal to seven days of quarterly revenue. Net debt or positive net cash. Net debt or positive net cash is defined as unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments minus any borrowings under our credit facility and the principal balance of our senior unsecured notes. Management believes that net debt or positive net cash provides useful information regarding the level of Qorvo's indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. Our earnings release contains forward-looking free cash flow, gross margin, income tax rate and diluted earnings per share. We provide these non-GAAP measures to investors on a prospective basis for the same reasons (set forth above) that we provide them to investors on a historical basis. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures without unreasonable effort due to variability and difficulty in making accurate projections for items that would be required to be included in the GAAP measures, such as stock-based compensation, acquisition and integration related costs, restructuring related charges, asset impairments and the provision for income taxes. We believe such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. Limitations of non-GAAP financial measures. The primary material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool compared to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are these non-GAAP financial measures (i) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry, and (ii) exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance, thus limiting their usefulness as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing full disclosure of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the corresponding GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, to enable investors to perform their own analysis of our gross profit and gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, net income per diluted share and net cash provided by operating activities. We further compensate for the limitations of our use of non-GAAP financial measures by presenting the corresponding GAAP measures more prominently.

The contract, awarded to Qorvo Biotechnologies, a wholly owned subsidiary of Qorvo, helps advance the production and market launch of the Qorvo Omnia™ diagnostic test platform. Qorvo Biotechnologies’ COVID-19 antigen test was recently granted emergency use authorization (EUA) by the U.S. FDA. The Qorvo Omnia platform represents a paradigm shift in diagnostic testing capability by using high frequency Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) sensors to achieve rapid SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) antigen testing. BAW sensor technology enables low Limit of Detection (LOD) levels that are similar to molecular testing capability. NIH launched RADx in the early months of the pandemic to speed innovation in the development and commercialization of technologies for COVID-19 testing. “Qorvo’s RF-based diagnostic technology has met review criteria to become a part of the RADx portfolio,” said Tiffani Bailey Lash, Ph.D., Co-Program Lead for the RADxTech program. “Qorvo’s antigen test has a lot of potential with near-PCR-level accuracy for use at point-of-care settings.” James Klein, president of Qorvo Biotechnologies, said, “Widespread testing with rapid and reliable results plays a critical role in helping public health officials respond to infectious disease outbreaks. We are committed to supporting the ongoing fight against COVID-19 as well as expanding the availability of tools with broader applicability.” Qorvo has more than 30 years of experience working with government contracts and has shipped billions of products containing its BAW RF technology across a range of industries. For more information, visit www.qorvobiotech.com. This project has been funded in part by the NIH Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADxSM) initiative with federal funds from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, National Institutes of Health.

company,1618516860,Qorvo® Biotechnologies Receives FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Rapid COVID-19 Antigen Testing,66325569,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ugiktoCf3bO0vUqAiQOinA--~B/aD01MjA7dz0xMzY1O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/globenewswire.com/fbfc5e0688d683cef9cb312fe0bb1bbe,QRVO,Yahoo,"GREENSBORO, N.C., April 15, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Qorvo® (Nasdaq: QRVO), a leading provider of innovative radio frequency (RF) solutions that connect the world, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Qorvo Omnia™ SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test. The test is authorized for the qualitative detection of nucleocapsid viral antigens from SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swab specimens from individuals who are suspected of COVID-19. The Qorvo Omnia platform represents a paradigm shift in diagnostic testing capability by using high frequency Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) sensors to achieve SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) antigen testing in approximately 20 minutes. BAW sensor technology enables low Limit of Detection (LOD) levels that are similar to molecular testing capability. The Qorvo Omnia platform features a portable test instrument, microfluidic cartridge and secure connectivity. The microfluidic cartridge design enables specific binding with additional wash steps similar to central lab instrument operation and demonstrated results including 100% specificity during clinical trials. Fred S. Apple, Ph.D., a member of Qorvo Biotechnologies’ advisory board, Co-Medical Director of Toxicology Laboratory at Hennepin Healthcare/Hennepin County Medical Center, and Professor of Laboratory Medicine & Pathology at the University of Minnesota, said, “This is very exciting news. FDA authorization of Qorvo’s Omnia Antigen Test provides a rapid, sensitive and specific assessment of individuals, assisting providers trying to either rule in or rule out COVID-19, comparable to many of the PCR testing platforms in use. The testing system will hopefully be an avenue to assist in opening up the United States to be closer to business as usual.” James Klein, President of Qorvo Biotechnologies, said, “The FDA’s EUA is recognition that the Qorvo Omnia platform can help address the ongoing need for rapid, accurate and clinically-reliable diagnostic testing. We are honored to leverage Qorvo’s technology portfolio to help public health officials respond to this global pandemic.” For more information, visit www.qorvobiotech.com. The Qorvo Omnia SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test has not been FDA cleared or approved. It has been authorized by the FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization and testing is limited to laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. §263a, to perform moderate or high complexity tests. This test has been authorized only for the detection of proteins from SARS-CoV-2, not for any other viruses or pathogens. These tests are only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostic tests for detection and/or diagnosis of COVID-19 under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.

company,1609782976,"The Coming 5G Boom Is Not Fully Priced in These 2 Stocks, Say Analysts",62141238,https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?217738408,QRVO,Nasdaq,"It’s in the nature of human ingenuity to constantly adapt technology, improve functionality and enhance its usefulness in our lives. The next generation of WiFi, 5G, meets that standard, and then some. The new tech brings us faster connections, lower latency, more efficient data transfers, and improved security – and it has been online for two years. Now it’s getting ready to expand.Expansion will entail a major buildout, a densification of the physical infrastructure needed for the propagation of network signals. 5G features enhanced capabilities when compared to earlier generations of WiFi, but it also has one glaring weakness: significantly shorter signal range. We’re willing to accept that trade-off, but it does make the tower build-out a bottleneck on the way to full adoption of 5G coverage.We’re beginning to get through that bottleneck. Around the world, major cities are putting public 5G systems online, and new smartphone lines are 5G enabled. And as we head into the 5G future, those companies that are fully invested in the boom will stand to gain. Wall Street’s analysts have been scouting the field, and have found two stocks that haven’t fully priced in that boom – and so give investors opportunities to gain. Let's take a closer look. Radius Global Infrastructure (RADI)The buildout of 5G, and its expansion outside of urban areas will require infrastructure – towers, transmitters, rooftop installations, all of the physical buildings that support the cell systems we depend on. Radius is, at heart, a real estate company, operating as a REIT, and buying up communications properties which it leases to operators. Radius operates in the US, and derives its income from leases on its properties.Last year, Radius changed its name from Digital Landscape Group and moved its headquarters from the UK to the US. The move coincided with a shift in trading from the London Stock Exchange to the NASDAQ, and adoption of the new ticker symbol, RADI. The move was completed in October, and since then RADI shares have gained ~49%.Cell towers and rooftop transmitter sites are considered ‘mission critical’ infrastructure in the wireless networking industry, and Radius’ revenues show it. The company reported $14 million in 3Q19, which grew 23% to $17.9 million in 3Q20. Among the bulls is Credit Suisse analyst Sami Badri, who rates RADI an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $19 price target. This figure indicates a 46% upside for the coming year. (To watch Badri’s track record, click here)Backing his bullish stance, Badri writes: “We forecast RADI to grow revenues at ~21% CAGR through 2023E on a normalized basis… RADI’s discount compared to TowerCos is another key factor driving our bullish view. RADI’s net growth rate is fairly similar to TowerCos after considering churn and maintenance capex. Bearing in mind the long-dated lease terms and visibility/reliability of cash flows, we believe that the large gap in multiples between RADI and TowerCos is unwarranted and that RADI is likely to trade higher as its multiple increases over time to reflect its lower risk profile.” It has been relatively quiet when it comes to other analyst activity. In the last three months, only 2 analysts have issued ratings. However, as they were both Buys, the word on the Street is that RADI is a Moderate Buy. Based on the $20 average price target, shares could climb ~54% higher in the next twelve months. (See RADI stock analysis on TipRanks)Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO)Cell properties are important, but no 5G device will function without the most modern semiconductor chips. That’s where Qorvo comes in. This company is a mid-size player in the chip industry, but it holds a strong market position in the networking chipset niche – exactly what the new 5G handsets and smartphone will require to access the new networks. The company also produces lines of chips for cordless phones and industrial radio devices.Qorvo is actively developing a portfolio of 5G enabled chipsets in multiple areas of the networking industry, including mobile devices, infrastructure hardware, and radio frequency (RF) devices. The company is one of the chip suppliers for Apple (AAPL), giving it access to the device makers’ 1 billion installed user base.After dipping in Q1 when coronavirus hit, QRVO has had a spectacular year. EPS has risen from 43 cents in Q1 to $1.20 in Q3. Subsequently, the stock has climbed 43% in 2020, and has seen its market cap expand to ~$19 billion.In a note on ‘best ideas for 2021,’ Cowen analyst Karl Ackerman writes of Qorvo: “The pivot to 5G is occurring faster than 4G, which was a boon for RF stocks and industry fundamentals in the early few years of the ramp. QRVO continues to expand its capability across the entire RF signal chain for BAW – perhaps the most critical filter technology for 5G. Let’s not forget its ~$400MM 5G infrastructure business is very diversified across all non-Huawei vendors – particularly in China, and QRVO’s 5G content opportunity is 10x higher than 4G.""Ackerman is bullish on QRVO's forward prospects, and rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy). His $225 price target suggests it has room for ~37% growth in the year ahead. (To watch Ackerman’s track record, click here)Overall, Qorvo’s Moderate Buy analyst consensus rating is based on 17 reviews, breaking down to 12 Buys and 5 Holds.
