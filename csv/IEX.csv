(IEX) has agreed to purchase Airtech Group Inc., US Valve Corp., and associated entities for a consideration of $470 million from investment funds that are managed by EagleTree Capital. IDEX expects this transaction to close by the end of 2Q. Airtech provides a broad range of engineered pressure technology products such as vacuum pumps, regenerative blowers, compressor systems, and valves. Its end markets include alternative energy, food processing, medical, packaging, and transportation. IDEX CEO and President Eric Ashleman said, “The acquisition of Airtech expands our expertise in specialized, high-performing air moving technologies, increasing our ability to serve customers’ needs.” Ashleman added, “Airtech has an excellent record of providing highly engineered solutions for niche applications across a wide array of industries. We expect this acquisition to be an outstanding fit for IDEX.” (See IDEX Corp stock analysis on TipRanks) What’s more, the company is actively seeking avenues to deploy capital, according to Ashleman. IDEX is also looking to strategically acquire new-age technologies that will enhance the company’s growth while also strengthening its product portfolio. Yesterday, IDEX came out with its 1Q numbers. On the back of improving margins, its non-GAAP EPS of $1.51 came in ahead of the $1.41 consensus estimate. In addition, the company reported a 9.7% year-on-year jump in revenue to $652.04 million and beat analysts’ estimates of $634.85 million. The growth in revenue was attributable to higher orders as well as improved market conditions. On April 27, Oppenheimer analyst Bryan Blair reiterated a Hold rating on the stock but did not assign any price target. Commenting on the company’s 1Q performance, Blair said, “1Q demonstrated continued solid execution from the IDEX team with strong order and sales trends levered by accelerating M&A investment.” Overall, consensus on the Street is that IDEX Corp. is a Strong Buy, based on 5 Buys and 1 Hold. The average analyst price target of $231.40 implies just 2% upside potential. Shares have gained about 44.7% over the past year.

Its end markets include alternative energy, food processing, medical, packaging, and transportation.IDEX CEO and President Eric Ashleman said, “The acquisition of Airtech expands our expertise in specialized, high-performing air moving technologies, increasing our ability to serve customers’ needs.”  Ashleman added, “Airtech has an excellent record of providing highly engineered solutions for niche applications across a wide array of industries. We expect this acquisition to be an outstanding fit for IDEX.” (See IDEX Corp stock analysis on TipRanks)What's more, the company is actively seeking avenues to deploy capital, according to Ashleman. IDEX is also looking to strategically acquire new-age technologies that will enhance the company’s growth while also strengthening its product portfolio.Yesterday, IDEX came out with its 1Q numbers. On the back of improving margins, its non-GAAP EPS of $1.51 came in ahead of the $1.41 consensus estimate. In addition, the company reported a 9.7% year-on-year jump in revenue to $652.04 million and beat analysts’ estimates of $634.85 million. The growth in revenue was attributable to higher orders as well as improved market conditions.On April 27, Oppenheimer analyst Bryan Blair reiterated a Hold rating on the stock but did not assign any price target.Commenting on the company’s 1Q performance, Blair said, “1Q demonstrated continued solid execution from the IDEX team with strong order and sales trends levered by accelerating M&A investment.”Overall, consensus on the Street is that IDEX Corp. is a Strong Buy, based on 5 Buys and 1 Hold. The average analyst price target of $231.40 implies just 2% upside potential. Shares have gained about 44.7% over the past year.Related News:Amazon’s AWS Partners With DISH NetworkSalesforce Aids Sonos In Digital TransformationCrocs Pops 11% After 1Q Results Beat Expectations",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a1a91a8adcbec4287d66d2feac15047e997854a8203ea9ec470d7d7106669d26

Here is Benzinga's everything-that-matters guide for this Wednesday's Q4 earnings announcement. Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue Analysts covering IDEX modeled for quarterly EPS of $1.31 on revenue of $602.14 million. In the same quarter last year, IDEX reported EPS of $1.33 on revenue of $606.00 million. Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates""; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise"", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. View more earnings on IEX If the company were to match the consensus estimate, earnings would be down 1.5%. Sales would be down 0.64% on a year-over-year basis. In comparison to analyst estimates in the past, here is how the company's reported EPS stacks up: Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 EPS Estimate 1.2 0.99 1.30 1.36 EPS Actual 1.4 1.10 1.33 1.33 Revenue Estimate 563.53 M 526.34 M 597.50 M 616.06 M Revenue Actual 581.11 M 561.25 M 594.46 M 606.00 M Stock Performance Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 12.68%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders can be content going into this earnings release. Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call. IDEX is scheduled to hold the call at 10:30:00 ET and can be accessed here.
