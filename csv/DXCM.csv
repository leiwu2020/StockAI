company,1621012793,"If You Do the Math, Senseonics Makes No Sense",67865190,,DXCM,Yahoo,"While no one knows for sure what the recent rumblings in the major indices entails, looking at the bigger picture, the post-novel-coronavirus rally has been one of the most remarkable in history. Naturally, the bullishness extended to high-profitability potential growth investments like Senseonics (NYSEAMERICAN:SENS). As a play on the science, Senseonics is brilliant. As a portfolio booster, SENS stock might be a disaster. Source: Shutterstock About the only thing that could change the last sentence is if you were short the medical technology firm. To be clear, I’m not recommending you short Senseonics shares, since that brings up another level of variability and risk. However, I am asking you to consider — as an idea, not advice — to sell SENS stock. Perhaps not all of it, but take some profits off the table while you still can. Before I get deluged with hate mail, let’s go over why the idea of dumping SENS stock arouses intense anger. Fundamentally, I can understand the argument that Sensenoics is a game changer for diabetes patients. In the old paradigm, patients had to endure frequent and often painful finger pricks to monitor their blood-sugar levels. On the other hand, Senseonics provides freedom through its long-term continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips You can read the literature yourself, but to provide a very quick summary, medical professionals insert a sensor underneath the patient’s skin. This enables frequent, accurate monitoring of blood-sugar levels for 90 days (via the Eversense 90-Day CGM System), doing away with finger pricks entirely. Further, as our own Mark Hake predicted recently, “My thesis is that SENS stock will recover once the FDA allows Senseonics to start selling its device in the U.S.” Further, Hake mentions that Senseonics can follow in the footsteps of another CGM company, DexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM). 10 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks for Your Reliability Short List It’s possible. Is it probable? The market doesn’t agree. SENS Stock Is a High-Risk, Low-Probability Trade You might recall that a week or so ago, one of the biggest headlines was that debris from a Chinese rocket might land somewhere on populated parts of earth. Worse yet, experts didn’t know exactly where the debris would land until hours before impact. Amid the cacophony, I appreciated one scientist’s voice of reason. The world is about 70% water, so the chances of the debris landing on people are minimal. In other words, you have bigger problems to worry about. And that expert was right. Sure, the debris killing people made for great headlines. After all, if it bleeds, it leads. But sometimes, you must push away sensationalism and simply run the numbers. That’s really the thesis for SENS stock that matters. For instance, medical equipment giant Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has a CGM called FreeStyle Libre. I’m not sure if this CGM is better than Senseonics’ CGM. But you know what? It doesn’t matter. The market wants ABT, not SENS stock. Look at the variance in the shares available on Abbott’s bid-ask spread. At time of writing, 10% more shares are available at the bid of $118.53 than the ask of $118.51. Put simply, more buyers exist than sellers, which suggests (though not guarantees) that ABT will move higher. My InvestorPlace colleague mentioned DexCom. Here, the situation is way starker, with nearly 38% more shares available at a $334.41 bid than an ask of $334.78. It implies again that DXCM will move higher. Unfortunately, Senseonics is a completely different story. In this case, nearly 36% more shares are available at a $1.91 ask than at a $1.90 bid. Stated another way, it’s the opposite of the current housing market: Way more people want to sell than want to buy. The Math, Not the Feels Naturally, the guttural reaction to the above is that people who are selling SENS stock are idiots. Further, I’m an idiot. Nevertheless, my idiocy has no bearing on free market dynamics. In fact, I could write the most beautifully crafted bullish (or bearish) argument for SENS stock. Folks, it’s not going to change the wide discrepancy in the shares offered on the bid-ask spread. Definitely, it won’t change a discrepancy like this. But this is a lesson on proper investing strategies, if you want to hear it. Idiots or not, the market is dumping SENS stock — and they want to dump some more! If you feel that’s a bullish case for Senseonics, you’re taking a huge risk. For me, I’m staying away with 10-foot pole.

company,1611036500,Abbott vs Dexcom: Which “Strong Buy” Stock Could Deliver Higher Returns in 2021?,63895954,https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?912181558,DXCM,Nasdaq,"With multiple COVID-19 vaccines being distributed across the world, companies focused on other medical conditions are now grabbing the Street's attention. One such disorder is diabetes, which is growing rapidly worldwide—sedentary lifestyles being a key reason for that. A recent report by the World Health Organization (WHO) revealed that deaths from diabetes surged 70% globally between 2019 and 2020.Abbott and Dexcom are some of the names that are developing diabetes monitoring systems. Using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, we will place Abbott and Dexcom alongside each other and pick the stock reflecting a more compelling play.Abbott Laboratories (ABT)Abbott has a diversified business that includes four segments: Medical Devices, Diagnostics, Nutrition and Established Pharmaceutical Products (which generates revenue from the sale of branded generic pharmaceutical products outside of the US).Since the pandemic's onset, Abbott has been in the news for the multiple COVID-19 tests developed by the company. Most recently, BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Test Card was granted the FDA’s emergency use authorization for virtually guided at-home use.Coming to diabetes, Abbott sees tremendous growth in the area, especially through its FreeStyle Libre technology, which is a sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring system. Sales of FreeStyle Libre systems grew 37.9% in 3Q 2020.  Moreover, in 3Q 2020, the company’s FreeStyle Libre 3 system secured CE Mark for use by diabetic patients in Europe. The FreeStyle Libre 3 provides real-time glucose readings automatically delivered to the user’s smartphone every minute, offering unsurpassed 14-day accuracy and real-time glucose alarms. The company also won CE Mark for its Libre Sense Glucose Sport Biosensor, which helps athletes “better understand the efficacy of their nutritional choices on training and athletic performance.”Furthermore, Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre 2 received approval in December 2020 by Health Canada for adults and children (4 and older) with diabetes. (See ABT stock analysis on TipRanks)Last month, Raymond James analyst Jayson Bedford reiterated a Buy rating for Abbott following a call with the company’s management. Bedford stated that the company is working through the reimbursement channels in Europe and expects to launch Libre 3 in the “coming months,” while the analyst had anticipated a December launch.Bedford also specified that management did not lay out a timeline for Libre 3 roll out in the US, but he estimates the launch could happen in 2021. The analyst also noted that the app for the Libre 2 system has not yet been approved, but management is optimistic about the submission.Commenting on the prospects of the COVID-19 testing portfolio, Abbott’s management anticipates the testing market to remain strong into mid-2021 and then start to decline in the second half of this year.To back his bullish stance on Abbott, the analyst concluded, “The 'third wave' of CV-19 has raised the near-term uncertainty level (for the group), but ABT remains well positioned given its diversified portfolio, and the CV-19 testing tailwind, which lessens the near-term risk profile. Management is executing well, and enters 2021 with momentum.”Overall, consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 8 Buys versus 2 Holds. Abbott shares have risen 25.1% over the past year and the average price target of $120.57 suggests upside potential of 8.3% in the months ahead.   Dexcom (DXCM)Diabetes is growing rapidly and so is the need for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, which Dexcom specializes in. The company's G6 CGM system is FDA-permitted for use by people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Last week, the company announced better-than-anticipated preliminary results for 4Q 2020, which calls for revenue to meet or exceed $567 million. This implies year-over-year growth of 23%, with U.S. revenue expected to rise about 20% to $451 million and international revenue to grow about 33% to $116 million. (See DXCM stock analysis on TipRanks)Overall, the company expects to meet or exceed revenue of $1.925 billion in 2020, reflecting a gain of over 30%. As for the initial 2021 outlook, Dexcom calls for top-line growth in the range of 15%-20%. The company’s outlook is based on an increase in its sensor volumes, driven by the growing CGM awareness for people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, continued expansion beyond the US, shifting channel mix and overall market dynamics.Covering Dexcom for Oppenheimer, analyst Steven Lichtman notes that the company’s international business was the primary driver of the revenue beat, owing to new initiatives including direct-to-consumer and e-commerce channel.Indeed, Dexcom is pursuing international growth and has extended its G6 CGM offering to additional markets, including the rollout in Belgium and Turkey in 4Q 2020.Commenting on the 2021 outlook, Lichtman noted that the company has maintained a conservative stance when it comes to its guidance in the past two years. The analyst assumes that the impact of competition from Abbott's Libre franchise is factored into the forecast. He believes that growth drivers for 2021 include “big new opportunities in T2 [Type 2 diabetes] and international expansion along with the G7 launch.”On the 3Q earnings call, Dexcom stated that it expects to launch G7 in several key markets in the second half of 2021, and then expand its reach into all of its core markets in 2022.Overall, Lichtman continues to be bullish on Dexcom and maintained a Buy rating with a $445 price target.Currently, Dexcom scores a Strong Buy analyst consensus based on 9 Buys and 2 Holds. The average price target stands at $456.11, indicating upside potential of 28.8% from current levels. Shares have already risen 53.5% over the past 52 weeks.Bottom lineAbbott’s diversified business model and exposure to major growth areas like diabetes are its key strengths. Dexcom is completely focused on meeting the growing need for its CGM systems in the domestic as well as international markets. While the Street is bullish on both companies, right now, the average price target indicates a higher upside potential for Dexcom stock.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.
