Both sets of data are scheduled to be released today. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond is set to release the results of its monthly survey of manufacturing activity today.



S&P, Dow, and Nasdaq futures were in the green at the time of writing, with 0.1%, 0.1%, and 0.3% higher trading, respectively.



Cognyte Software (CGNT), Korn Ferry (KFY), and Plug Power (PLUG) are expected to report earnings today.



Torchlight Energy Resources (TRCH) was the most actively traded stock in pre-market trading, with 5.6 million shares having changed hands at the time of writing. Recently, the oil and gas exploration company postponed the closing date of the business combination transaction with Metamaterial Inc. to June 30, 2021. Notably, the extension of the date gives time for the special Series A Preferred Stock dividend, declared last week, to transpire.



vTv Therapeutics (VTVT) was the biggest gainer in pre-market trading as the stock jumped 24.2% at the time of writing. Recently, the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company inked a licensing deal with Cantex Pharmaceuticals. Per the terms of the agreement, Cantex wins exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize azeliragon, vTv’s novel antagonist of RAGE (the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts). 



vTv CEO Steve Holcombe commented, “RAGE is a highly attractive target for the treatment of a wide spectrum of disorders. We believe Cantex is the right partner to further the development of azeliragon, which vTv had studied in Alzheimer’s disease, in new therapeutic indications. They have deep experience in clinical development and the proven capability of repurposing drug candidates for new indications.”



New Concept Energy Inc. (GBR) was the biggest laggard in pre-market trading, as the stock plunged around 17.5% at the time of writing. The Dallas-based company, which is focused on the real estate rental business, has no fundamental news in support of the trading sentiment.



In M&A news, Uber Technologies (UBER) inked a deal to buy the remaining shares of Cornershop that it does not already own, which is 47%. Upon the deal's close, Uber will own 100% of the grocery delivery start-up and make it its wholly-owned subsidiary. Notably, the company acquired the majority stake in the third quarter of 2020 (except in Mexico, which closed in January 2021).



The rest of Cornershop will be acquired in an all-stock transaction, with the issue of 29 million shares of Uber’s stock to the minority Cornershop investors for a purchase price of $1.4 billion. The transaction is expected to close this July.



Uber commented in an SEC filing, “Cornershop’s financial results are already fully consolidated in the Company’s financial statements given the Company’s existing majority ownership, therefore no change is expected to the Company’s Gross Bookings, Revenue or Adjusted EBITDA as a result of the transaction.”



Meanwhile, Netflix (NFLX) and Amblin Partners, the company headed by Steven Spielberg, entered into a strategic partnership to produce multiple new films per year for the streaming platform. Amid stiff competition in the streaming business, the deal is likely to enhance Netflix’s streaming library with promising entertainment options.



Netflix’s Head of Global Film Scott Stuber commented, “Amblin and Steven Spielberg are synonymous with incredible entertainment. Their passion and artistry combine to make films that both captivate and challenge audiences.”



Welltower (WELL) announced its intention to purchase Holiday Retirement’s 86-property senior housing folio for $1.58 billion. The transaction is likely to close in the third quarter of this year. Welltower is a real estate investment trust that invests in healthcare infrastructure.



Upon closing of the transaction, Atria Senior Living, with whom Welltower has inked a deal to manage properties, will acquire Holiday Retirement, attain control of the properties and retain Holiday’s senior management and staff.



Welltower CEO Shankh Mitra said, “Welltower is thrilled to expand its strong partnership with Atria through the acquisition of this unique platform of assets. John and the Atria team share our vision for the significant, multi-year growth opportunity in the seniors housing sector and we are excited to embark on this journey together. Through a highly incentivized and aligned management contract, we have created tremendous upside opportunity for stakeholders of both Welltower and Atria.”



IAA Inc. (IAA), a company that provides a marketplace for vehicle purchases and sales, disclosed that it has acquired Auto Exchange’s business to expand its footprint in the New Jersey market. Transaction details remain under wraps. Auto Exchange caters to the vehicle salvage industry in New Jersey. IAA, via its platform, helps facilitate the sale of total-loss, damaged, and low-value vehicles.



IAA CEO and President John Kett commented, “Bringing Auto Exchange under the IAA umbrella will allow us to provide premier service to our selling and buying customers in the New Jersey area.”



In other news, the American multinational beverage corporation Coca-Cola (KO) has revealed its plan to double its spending with minority-owned media firms by 2024. The company said that media companies owned by Black, Hispanic, Asian-American, and Pacific Islander (AAPI), and other partners will account for 8% of the company’s total annual media budget in North America by 2024.



Coca-Cola’s North America operating unit Chief marketing officer Melanie Boulden said, “We must take a leadership role, and that’s why we’re not only committing to increase our investment with minority-owned and led media companies, but also are focused on non-media partnerships and empowerment initiatives designed to foster growth and increase competitive advantage of minority businesses and communities.”",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=610d096fa84c85c625c314510f76e9564252c25f720520308417dd4ac9eaddcb

The stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 12 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average Welltower analyst price target of $81.87 implies 1.6% upside potential from current levels. Shares have gained 56.8% over the past year.

company,1618589290,Ranking the Big 4 Healthcare REITs,66319316,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gzb70D6tJZ8VlbOrNIpaZQ--~B/aD00MDA7dz03Mjg7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/investorplace_417/ba4b0dc35fb1104aefd8d4338c2556cd,WELL,Yahoo,"Income investors often look to real estate investment trusts, or REITs, as these stocks usually have very high yields. Looking more specifically at a certain part of the REIT industry, we feel that the corner of the industry devoted to healthcare REITs is very attractive for income investors. The population continues to get older in the U.S., with those over 80 expected to make up more than half of the country’s population by 2030. Many of those people will require housing and medical treatment as they age. Combine this fact with a shortage of healthcare properties, and the economic outlook for the major healthcare REITs is very promising.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 10 Stocks to Buy for Your $5K Robinhood Portfolio This article will rank the largest four healthcare REITs by total return potential over the next five years. These top funds are: Welltower (NYSE:WELL) Healthpeak Properties (NYSE:PEAK) Omega Healthcare Investors (NYSE:OHI) National Health Investors (NYSE:NHI) Healthcare REITs: Welltower (WELL) Source: Shutterstock Welltower has three business segments: senior housing, triple-net leases and outpatient medical. Welltower’s funds from operation, or FFO, have barely budged over the last decade. The growth rate is just 0.4%, but much of this is due to trust’s habit of issuing shares to fund acquisitions, something very common amongst REITs. Adjusted for share count, FFO has increased 8.6% since 2011. However, the COVID-19 pandemic hurt the trust’s business. Welltower is selling properties it doesn’t view as central to its future. Our estimated FFO growth rate through 2026 is just 1.2%. Prior to pausing its dividend growth in 2018, Welltower had increased its dividend for 14 consecutive years. This was no small feat, especially considering the increase in the share count. The trust was forced to cut its dividend, with shareholders receiving nearly 30% of the dividend in 2020 that they did in 2019. The stock currently yields 3.2%, a significant premium to the average yield of 1.4% for the S&P 500. Welltower trades around $75. We expect the trust to produce FFO of $2.94 for 2021, giving the stock a price-to-FFO ratio of 25.9. This implies that valuation reversion could be a sizeable impediment to total returns if the stock were to trade with our FFO multiple target of 13.5. We forecast valuation to be a 12.2% headwind to annual returns through 2026. Therefore, we view this particular stock as significantly overvalued. In total, we expect that Welltower will lose 7.3% per year over the next five years. We rate the stock as a sell, and it is the least attractive healthcare REIT today. We believe a low FFO growth rate and decent sized yield will be more than offset by valuation reversion. Healthpeak Properties (PEAK) Source: mTaira / Shutterstock.com Healthpeak Properties, formerly known as HCP, is the largest healthcare REIT in the country. The trust operates more than 620 properties, including those used for life sciences, senior housing and medical offices. Healthpeak Properties has undergone a momentous restructuring of its business over the past few years, divesting more than 150 properties over this period of time. This has led to several declines in its funds from operation, or FFO, which decreased at a rate of 3.6% since 2011. The trust does have some positives working in its favor. First, Healthpeak Properties remains the largest name in its industry even after selling non-core assets. The trust also receives nearly all of its revenue from private payer sources, meaning that it doesn’t depend very much at all on Medicare and Medicaid. Therefore, we anticipate FFO growth at 5% annually through 2026 off of our expected FFO of $1.58 per share in 2021. 10 Stocks at the Heart of Good Retirement Portfolios Healthpeak Properties has cut its dividend three times since 2016, so growing income from the trust is no guarantee. That said, shares yield 3.7%. With shares trading around $33, Healthpeak Properties trades at 20.9 times FFO estimates. For context, the stock has a price-to-FFO of 15.3 since 2011. Reverting to this valuation would reduce annual results by 3.1% for the next five years. We expect Healthpeak Properties to offer a total return of 5.6% per year over the next five years as a 5% FFO growth rate and 3.7% dividend yield are partially offset by a low single-digit valuation headwind. Healthcare REITs: Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI) Source: Shutterstock Omega Healthcare Investors Inc. (OHI) operates two business segments, skilled nursing and senior housing. Skill nursing contributes the vast majority of revenues. A growing need for healthcare services for aging populations will be a tailwind, though Omega isn’t as diversified as other names in this space as it has an overreliance on skilled nursing facilities. The trust did weather the COVID-19 pandemic rather well as it collected nearly all rent due in the most recent quarter. Omega’s FFO has compounded at a rate of almost 6% over the last decade but much of this growth occurred in the first few years. We feel that the trust is likely to grow its bottom-line at a rate of 2% per year through 2026 given choppy recent results. What likely makes Omega an attractive investment is its sizeable dividend yield, which stands at 7.1%. Even with a slight dividend reduction last year, Omega’s dividend has compounded at a rate of more than 5% since 2011. With Omega trading around $37, the stock is trading at 11.4 times our FFO estimate of $3.25 for 2021. The stock has traded with an average price-to-FFO ratio of 12 since 2011. Valuation could add 1% to total returns annually over the next half-decade. We forecast that Omega can provide a total return of 10.1%, driven primarily by a 7%+ yield with low single-digit contributions from both FFO growth and multiple expansion. We typically reserve our buy recommendations for stocks offering at least 10% annual returns. Therefore, we rate Omega as a buy. National Health Investors (NHI) Source: Shutterstock National Health Investors owns and operates independent living facilities, medical office buildings and senior living housing properties. The trust uses a variety of funding methods, such as joint venture and sale-leasebacks, to acquire assets. National Health is one of the more diversified healthcare REITs, which affords the trust some protection in case of difficulty in one area of its business. The variety of investment methods also allows for National Health to be creative when finding attractive properties for purchase. We believe that the trust will be able to grow its FFO by 5.5% through 2026 due to its business model. Unlike the other names on this list, National Health has not been forced to reduce its dividend. In fact, the trust has increased its dividend for 19 consecutive years. The dividend has a compound annual growth rate of 5% over the last decade, and the stock yields 5.9%. We forecast that National Health will produce FFO of $5.50 in 2021. With shares trading around $75, National Health has a price-to-FFO of 13.5. We have a targeted price-to-FFO of 13.8 for 2026, which would imply a small addition of 0.4% to total returns from an expanding multiple. Total returns for National Health are expected to be of 11.8% due mostly to FFO growth and dividend yield, though an expanding multiple will also be a factor. At the current price, National Health is not only a buy, but the trust is our favorite name in the healthcare REIT space.

The Health Care REITs Analyst: Joshua Dennerlein upgraded the ratings for Healthpeak Properties Inc (NYSE: PEAK) and Welltower Inc (NYSE: WELL) from Neutral to Buy. He raised the price target for Healthpeak Properties from $34 to $35.50 and for Welltower from $73 to $78. The Healthpeak Properties Takeaways: The company has made “significant progress” on its exit from the senior housing segment by closing $2.5 billion so far and with “the balance under letters of intent or purchase agreements,” Dennerlein said in the Tuesday upgrade note. The analyst views the 2021 guidance given by Healthpeak Properties as conservative. “We see upside to its SS NOI assumptions, particularly within its life science segment,” he said. “Longer term, we like PEAK’s development pipeline which we think should create significant value,” he further added. The Welltower Takeaways: The cap rates on the company’s recent acquisitions “have been trending well above our prior expectations,” Dennerlein said. Welltower had suggested during the fourth-quarter earnings call that ""they are likely to be net acquirers this year,"" the analyst said. “We now expect acquisitions to be accretive to the bottom line unlike our prior view that near-term accretion would be very limited given their focus on broken development deals/projects in lease up.” Latest Ratings for PEAK DateFirmActionFromTo Mar 2021B of A SecuritiesUpgradesNeutralBuy Mar 2021Morgan StanleyMaintainsEqual-Weight Dec 2020KeyBancDowngradesOverweightSector Weight View More Analyst Ratings for PEAK View the Latest Analyst Ratings See more from BenzingaClick here for options trades from BenzingaKeyBanc Expects Texas Instruments To Outperform, 'Well-positioned To Service Upside Demand'Morgan Stanley Upgrades Johnson Controls On Commercial Buildings Potential© 2021 Benzinga.com.

Additionally, Genesis will conditionally receive approximately $170 million in additional debt reductions from Welltower. Hence, Genesis expects to reduce its debt outstanding to Welltower by approximately $256 million and extend the maturity to January 1, 2024. Welltower will also receive equity in Genesis, increasing its stake in Genesis from approximately 6% to about 15%. It has also secured a $50 million debt investment from ReGen Healthcare that would convert into equity representing a 25% stake in the company. ReGen Healthcare also has the option to make an additional debt investment of $25 million exercisable no later than March 31 and to be funded by April 15. As part of the agreement, two Genesis Board Members, John F. DePodesta and Terry Rappuhn have relinquished their current positions. ReGen Healthcare has appointed David Harrington and John Randazzo, effective immediately. Also, Mr. Harrington has been appointed Chairman of the Board. Concurrently, Genesis intends to voluntarily delist from the New York Stock Exchange by March 25. Following the deregistration, the company anticipates that its Common Stock will be quoted on the OTC Pink Open Market. The company expects to file its 2020 Form 10-K by March 16, but it will not distribute a Q4 2020 earnings release or host a conference call. Price Action: GEN shares dropped 35.9% at $0.52, and WELL stock is up 0.48% at $68.95 in market trading hours on the last check Wednesday.
