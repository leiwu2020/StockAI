Here is Benzinga's outlook for the company. Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue Wall Street analysts see Leggett & Platt reporting earnings of $0.7 per share on revenue of $1.15 billion. In the same quarter last year, Leggett & Platt reported EPS of $0.68 on revenue of $1.15 billion. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates""; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise"", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. View more earnings on LEG If the company were to report earnings in line when it publishes results Monday, quarterly profit would be up 2.94%. Revenue would be have grown 0.44% from the same quarter last year. Here is how the company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past: Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 EPS Estimate 0.71 0.07 0.34 0.66 EPS Actual 0.80 0.16 0.41 0.68 Revenue Estimate 1.27 B 919.93 M 1.09 B 1.16 B Revenue Actual 1.21 B 845.10 M 1.05 B 1.15 B Stock Performance Shares of Leggett & Platt were trading at $42.62 as of February 04. Over the last 52-week period, shares are down 5.05%. Given that these returns are generally negative, long-term shareholders are probably a little upset going into this earnings release.
