At $16 a share, the listing would raise $413 million and give the company a market value of about $1.45 billion.A representative for Honest declined to comment.Founded in 2011, Honest has grown into a national brand and has partnerships with retail giants including Target Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. The Los Angeles-based company specializes in baby products such as diapers and wipes, which accounted for 63% of last year’s sales, as well as household cleaning supplies and personal care items.The share sale gives Alba a stake valued at about $90 million, according to the company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Investors selling some of their shares in the IPO include private equity firm L Catterton, Institutional Venture Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners and General Catalyst, the filings show.Alba, now the company’s chief creative officer, owns 5.65 million shares. She didn’t plan to sell her shares in the offering, according to the filings.The Los Angeles-based company’s losses shrank as its revenue climbed last year, according to the filings. It had a net loss of $14.5 million on revenue of $301 million in 2020, compared with a loss of $31 million on revenue of $236 million the previous year.The offering is being led by Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Jefferies Financial Group Inc.
