Chubb Limited (CB), however, said that it will continue to seek opportunities for acquisitions. The company said that it has the ability to capitalize on a favorable insurance market environment and is firmly focused on creating value for shareholders. Chubb’s statement came days after Hartford (HIG) said on March 23 that its board of directors had unanimously rejected Chubb’s business combination offer. Hartford said that entering into a discussion relating to the strategic transaction would not be in the best interests of shareholders. Notably, Chubb had submitted an unsolicited and non-binding takeover proposal on March 11 to acquire Hartford in a mix of cash and stock transaction. The company had agreed to pay $65 for each Hartford share. (See Chubb stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the statement, Wells Fargo analyst Elyse Greenspan reiterated a Buy rating. In a note to investors, Greenspan wrote, “We continue to think HIG is worth 1.8x in a takeout, which is around $81 per share, which is based on past deals within the P&C (Property & Casualty) sector, and do think that at some point CB does come back with a higher offer. HIG is trading down modestly today (down 3.1%, versus the S&P which is down 0.7%) and still sits above the $65 per share takeout offer from CB as we believe the market also expects there could still be a potential M&A (Merger & Acquisition) transaction.” Overall, the Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on the stock based on 8 Buys and 3 Holds. The average analyst price target of $179.36 implies upside potential of about 11.9% to current levels. Shares have gained about 47.9% in one year.

The investment and insurance company said that the new program will be effective from Jan. 1, 2021 to Dec. 31, 2022.Hartford Financial (HIG) will start buying back shares after reporting 4Q earnings results.Following the share buyback announcement, Wells Fargo analyst Elyse Greenspan maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $50 (6.9% upside potential) on the stock. The analyst said, “We think the shares should respond favorably to the announcement, which confirms they will be back repurchasing their shares in early 2021. We expect this authorization is about in line with consensus expectations.”Greenspan further added, “We think the company’s valuation (trading right at book value and at only 8.3x 2021 earnings) is not giving it credit for its strong underlying businesses, especially within commercial lines as we are in a hard commercial lines market (in the majority of business lines excluding workers’ compensation) and is discounting the stock for potential Covid-19 business interruption losses that we do not think will materialize.” (See HIG stock analysis on TipRanks)Meanwhile, the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on the stock. The Moderate Buy analyst consensus is based on 4 Buys and 3 Holds. The average price target stands at $51.43 and implies upside potential of about 9.9% to current levels.
