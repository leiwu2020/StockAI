Phase 3 trials of ruxolitinib cream have met their primary endpoints. The success of the topical JAK inhibitor tees Incyte up to seek approval in the U.S. and Europe in the second half of the year. Incyte said ruxolitinib beat placebo in terms of the proportion of patients whose facial vitiligo improved by 75% or more at Week 24. Details of how many patients met the F-VASI75 vitiligo score criteria remain under wraps, but Incyte said the overall efficacy and safety profile is consistent with its phase 2 results. In the earlier trial, 21% of patients who used the phase 3 dose—ruxolitinib cream 1.5% twice daily, experienced a 75% improvement by Week 24. The F-VASI75 rate rose to 66% by Week 104, although the figure comes from a smaller cohort as 41% of people were lost to follow-up. F-VASI75 at Week 52 was 37%. No new safety signals were observed. Incyte will prepare to file for approval while continuing the long-term efficacy and safety portions of the studies. Filings for approval for use in adolescents and adults in the U.S. and EU are planned for the second half of 2021. Price Action: INCY shares are up 0.41% at $82.96 during the market session on the last check Monday.

And Incyte reported data from their phase 3 study of baricitinib in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This study, called COV-BARRIER included 1525 patients and did not meet statistical significance on primary endpoints. Dr. Doron Sagman, Eli Lilly (LLY) Vice President of R&D and Medical Affairs for Canada said, “While we hoped to see a significant benefit on the composite primary endpoint, we were pleased to find a 38 percent reduction in all-cause mortality by day 28 in patients treated with baricitinib, the largest reported effect on mortality to date for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.” Sagman added, “We will continue to evaluate our findings and remain committed to exploring treatment options for COVID-19.” (See Eli Lilly stock analysis on TipRanks) In the study, the patients treated with baricitinib showed a 38% reduction in death by day 28. The company plans to publish detailed results of this study in the coming months and to also share data with regulators in the US, EU, Canada, and other geographies to determine the next steps to use the drug as a potential treatment for COVID-19 patients under hospitalization. Additionally, the drug is also under evaluation to treat COVID-19 patients together with remdesivir in the ACTT-4 trial. On April 7, Mizuho Securities analyst Vamil Divan reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and maintained a $228 price target (20.5% upside potential). Divan said he was “impressed by the Phase 2 donanemab data” and beyond donanemab sees “multiple potential upside drivers to the Lilly story, including diversified near-term top-line growth, continued margin expansion, and a promising pipeline with limited patent loss exposure.” Consensus among analysts is that Eli Lilly is a Strong Buy based on 10 Buys and 1 Hold. The average analyst price target of $231.64 implies upside potential of 22.4%. Shares have gained about 22.3% over the past year.

The trial did not meet statistical significance on the primary endpoint of the proportion of participants progressing to non-invasive ventilation or death by Day 28. Baricitinib-treated patients were 2.7% less likely than those receiving standard of care to progress to ventilation (non-invasive or mechanical) or death. Treatment with baricitinib in addition to SoC (which included 79% receiving corticosteroids and 19% receiving remdesivir, with some receiving both) resulted in a significant reduction in death from any cause by 38%. A numerical reduction in mortality was observed for all baseline severity subgroups of baricitinib-treated patients. It was most pronounced for patients receiving non-invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline (17.5% versus 29.4% for baricitinib plus SoC versus SoC. The frequency of adverse events was generally similar in the baricitinib and placebo groups. Severe infections and venous thromboembolism occurred in 8.5% and 2.7% of patients treated with baricitinib, respectively, versus 9.8 % and 2.5% on placebo. Lilly intends to publish detailed results of this study in a peer-reviewed journal in the coming months. The company will share the data from the study with regulatory authorities in the U.S., European Union, and other geographies to evaluate the next steps for baricitinib in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Yesterday, the FDA extended the review period for baricitinib in atopic dermatitis by three months. Price Action: LLY shares are up 0.3% at $182.8 in premarket trading on the last check Thursday, while INCY shares closed 2.2% lower at $81.38 on Wednesday.

The trial's primary endpoint was defined as a difference in the number of patients needing non-invasive ventilation including high flow oxygen, or invasive mechanical ventilation or death by Day 28. Patients treated with baricitinib were 2.7% less likely than those receiving standard of care to progress to ventilation or death, a difference that was not statistically significant. The trial, involving 1,525 patients, showed 38% reduction in mortality by Day 28 in patients that were treated with baricitinib plus standard of care, including corticosteroids and remdesivir. Lilly said it will publish detailed data from the study in a peer-reviewed journal in the coming months. ""Even though the study did not show a statistically-significant benefit on the primary endpoint, this trial showed the largest effect reported to date for reduction in mortality observed for this patient population with COVID-19,"" said Ilya Yuffa, senior vice president and president of Lilly Bio-Medicines. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization to baricitinib in combination with remdesivir in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Baricitinib, an oral JAK inhibitor, was discovered by Incyte. It is approved as Olumiant in the U.S. as a treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis and in the EU and Japan as a treatment for atopic dermatitis. Lilly shares were up 0.4% premarket, while Incyte was up 2%.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=52758453555759ac217ae43c94ec948573925f3e8141be88d2db647a349061cc

Shares of the biopharmaceutical company declined around 1.2% to close at $80.54 on Feb. 19.A priority review voucher (PRV) was submitted by Incyte (INCY) along with the NDA application, which shortens the review period by four months.The ruxolitinib cream is a selective JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor for topical application and is targeted to treat atopic dermatitis (AD), a type of eczema.Incyte said that the NDA was supported by clinical trial data, which showed that the application of ruxolitinib cream was safe and effective in patients with AD in individuals 12 years and older who are undergoing topical therapy.About 21 million individuals in the US are suffering from this chronic skin disease. (See Incyte stock analysis on TipRanks)Incyte Group Vice President Jim Lee said, “We are grateful to the people living with atopic dermatitis whose participation in our clinical trials helped generate the evidence to support this regulatory submission, and we look forward to working with the FDA as we seek to bring forward a new topical treatment for people living with this chronic skin disease.”On Feb. 9, Mizuho Securities analyst Mara Goldstein reiterated a Hold rating on the stock with a price target of $95 (18% upside potential). The analyst expects “positive signs from” the company’s “pipeline and strong cash flow from JAKAFI,” but is cautious, “on greater valuation expansion for the shares.”The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 4 analysts suggesting a Buy, 4 analysts recommending a Hold, and 1 analyst suggesting a Sell. The average analyst price target of $97 implies around 20% upside potential to current levels. Shares have gained about 1.6% over the past year. Incyte scores an 8 of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.Related News:Nurix Says FDA Approves New Drug Application For Leukemia Trial; Street Is BullishCVS Health Posts Better-Than-Expected 4Q Results; Shares Gain Pre-MarketNovavax Extends SK Bioscience Partnership For Supply Of 40M COVID-19 Vaccine Doses",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=075999d732a502fe0499958528777ab26cd22cd370dc019dfda846cc60b5a5b2
