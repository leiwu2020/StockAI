The financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps. The deal is expected to be modestly dilutive to the company’s financial results in 2021, and to be accretive thereafter.



Henry Schein is a global distributor of health care products and services to office-based dental and medical practitioners, with a presence in 32 countries.



The addition of eAssist will enhance HSIC's goal of providing best-in-class solutions to help the dental world increase efficiency and profitability. (See HSIC stock analysis on TipRanks)



eAssist Dental Solutions develops virtual dental billing outsourcing services with recorded sales of $31 million in 2020. It uses a mix of technology and human expertise, helping dental practitioners simplify operations, reduce cash flow-related stress, and free up resources to focus on patient care and clinical outcomes.



Henry Schein CEO Stanley M. Bergman commented, “We are delighted to add eAssist to our leading portfolio of value-added services, which will help our customers improve their critical insurance and billing functions so dental teams can focus on delivering quality patient care.”



Stifel Nicolaus analyst Jonathan Block recently maintained a Hold rating and the price target of $77 (2.3% downside potential) on the stock.



Block raised his Q2 EPS estimates from $0.92 to $1 after HSIC’s CEO commented on upbeat business trends and stable margins.



He further added, “The gross margin rebound seen in 1Q21 appears likely to remain intact, with management noting that the margin performance was tied to underlying business trends, rather than PPE sales. Looking forward, management expects gross margin to remain stable, with any margin fluctuation likely tied to operating expenses as certain items (travel, etc.) come back online.""



Overall, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 3 Buys and 3 Holds. The HSIC average analyst price target of $81.83 implies 3.9% upside potential from current levels. Shares of HSIC have jumped 40.8% over the past year.

Shares of the world’s largest provider of healthcare solutions to office-based dental and medical practitioners closed about 1.7% higher on Friday. Henry Schein’s (HSIC) announcement comes after it entered into amendments to its private placement facility agreements, which permitted the company to reinstate the program. As of the fiscal year ended 2020, the company had $201 million of its share repurchase authorization. Henry Schein CEO Stanley M. Bergman said, “Our solid cash flow has enabled us to continue to invest in the business, both through strategic acquisitions and share repurchases, reflecting our commitment to continue to deliver an attractive return on capital.” (See Henry Schein stock analysis on TipRanks) On Feb. 18, Barrington analyst Michael Petusky increased the stock’s price target to $80 (27.9% upside potential) from $72 and reiterated a Buy rating following the company’s “solid Q4 results.” In a note to investors, Petusky said, “While dental patient traffic remains well below pre-COVID levels, the company has continued to deliver results via incremental personal protective equipment and COVID-19 related business.” The consensus rating among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 4 Buys versus 1 Hold. The average analyst price target stands at $81.20 and implies upside potential of almost 30% to current levels. Shares have gained about 15% over the past year. Additionally, Henry Schein scores a “Perfect 10” from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

Bergman stated, “Expanding beyond our core base of office-based physicians and entering the home health market has been a long-standing strategic goal of Henry Schein’s medical business, and with PRISM we have the ideal partner with a strong brand and a complementary business model.”On Jan. 4, Baird analyst Jeff Johnson upgraded Henry Schein to Buy from Hold and raised the price target to $79 from $70. The analyst expects the company's dental patient volumes to improve sequentially throughout this year and sees ""a sentiment-driven potential recovery.""Currently, the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook, with a Moderate Buy analyst consensus based on 2 Buys. The average price target of $75.50 indicates an upside potential of 11.4% from current levels. Shares have risen only 1.8% over the past year.
