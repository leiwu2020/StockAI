Throughout the whole process, it was essential that we stayed true to our vision of housing the world’s most vibrant health and fitness community, and via our integrated approach combining: Wellteq’s 24/7 connectivity, Garmin’s supreme health data, and our gym facility and community management experience, we have been able to build a holistic program that is now thriving in the ever-adjusting office environment we see today.” About Wellteq Digital Health Inc.

This broad strength across the category led to new revenue records for each of its three subgroups, and we're very excited about the road ahead for these products… “..Look no further than the great potential of Fitness+, which pairs with Apple Watch to deliver real-time on-screen fitness data alongside world-class workouts by the world's best trainers. There are new sessions added each week, and customers are loving the flexibility, challenge and fun of these classes as well as how the pairing with Apple Watch pushes you to achieve your fitness goals.
